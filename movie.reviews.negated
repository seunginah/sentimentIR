0 0 story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig .  starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy .  a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane ,  violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers .  unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no NOT_general NOT_narrative NOT_eventually NOT_making NOT_it NOT_just NOT_too NOT_off NOT_putting .  even those from the era should be turned off .  the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader .  on a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond .  future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly . 
1 1 bromwell high is a cartoon comedy .  it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life ,  such as "teachers" .  my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is "teachers" .  the scramble to survive financially ,  the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp ,  the pettiness of the whole situation ,  all remind me of the schools i knew and their students .  when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school ,  i immediately recalled  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  at  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  high .  a classic line: inspector: i'm here to sack one of your teachers .  student: welcome to bromwell high .  i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched .  what a pity that it isn't! 
2 0 robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time .  this movie is so wasteful of talent ,  it is truly disgusting .  the script is unbelievable .  the dialog is unbelievable .  jane fonda's character is a caricature of herself ,  and not NOT_a NOT_funny NOT_one .  the movie moves at a snail's pace ,  is photographed in an ill-advised manner ,  and is insufferably preachy .  it also plugs in every cliche in the book .  swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role ,  but so what?<br /><br />equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review .  when a movie is this worthless ,  it doesn't NOT_require NOT_ten NOT_lines NOT_of NOT_text NOT_to NOT_let NOT_other NOT_readers NOT_know NOT_that NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_waste NOT_of NOT_time NOT_and NOT_tape .  avoid this movie . 
3 1 if you like adult comedy cartoons ,  like south park ,  then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high .  keisha ,  natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches ,  i think keisha is a good leader .  there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school .  there's the idiotic principal ,  mr .  bip ,  the nervous maths teacher and many others .  the cast is also fantastic ,  lenny henry's gina yashere ,  eastenders chrissie watts ,  tracy-ann oberman ,  smack the pony's doon mackichan ,  dead ringers' mark perry and blunder's nina conti .  i didn't NOT_know NOT_this NOT_came NOT_from NOT_canada ,  but it is very good .  very good! 
4 0 i saw the capsule comment said "great acting . " in my opinion ,  these are two great actors giving horrible performances ,  and with zero chemistry with one another ,  for a great director in his all-time worst effort .  robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time .  jane fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no NOT_handle NOT_on NOT_this NOT_character ,  mostly because the character is so poorly written .  molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing .  although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy ,  watching it is a true "bummer . " i give it 1 out of 10 ,  truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that i have ever seen . 
5 1 bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant .  expertly scripted and perfectly delivered ,  this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter .  it's vulgar ,  provocative ,  witty and sharp .  the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society (or to be more accurate ,  of any society) .  following the escapades of keisha ,  latrina and natella ,  our three "protagonists" for want of a better term ,  the show doesn't NOT_shy NOT_away NOT_from NOT_parodying NOT_every NOT_imaginable NOT_subject .  political correctness flies out the window in every episode .  if you enjoy shows that aren't NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_poke NOT_fun NOT_of NOT_every NOT_taboo NOT_subject NOT_imaginable ,  then bromwell high will not NOT_disappoint! 
6 0 if i had not NOT_read NOT_pat NOT_barker's NOT_'union NOT_street' NOT_before NOT_seeing NOT_this NOT_film ,  i would have liked it .  unfortuntately this is not NOT_the NOT_case .  it is actually my kind of film ,  it is well made ,  and in no NOT_way NOT_do NOT_i NOT_want NOT_to NOT_say NOT_otherwise ,  but as an adaptation ,  it fails from every angle . <br /><br />the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished .  i was put through tears ,  repulsion ,  shock ,  anger ,  sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street .  excellent .  a novel that at times i felt i could not NOT_read NOT_any NOT_more NOT_of ,  but i novel i simply couldn't put down .  depressing yes ,  but utterly gripping . <br /><br />the film .  oh dear .  hollywood took barker's truth and reality ,  and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it .  a beautiful film ,  an inspiring soundtrack ,  excellent performances ,  a tale of hope and romance .  .  . yes .  an adaptation of 'union street' .  .  . no . <br /><br />the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda's character ,  their stories are touched on ,  but many are discarded .  i accept that some of barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing ,  and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't NOT_practical ,  but the content is not NOT_my NOT_main NOT_issue .  the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain ,  broken windows covered with cardboard ,  and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine ,  pretty houses ,  and a twinkling william's score . <br /><br />if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality' ,  i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'schindler's list' .  .  . but without the happy ending . 
7 1 "all the world's a stage and its people actors in it"--or something like that .  who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit--or even at the theatre door? why is not NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_participants NOT_in NOT_the NOT_theatrical NOT_experience ,  including the story itself?<br /><br />this film was a grand experiment that said: "hey! the story is you and it needs more than your attention ,  it needs your active participation" .  "sometimes we bring the story to you ,  sometimes you have to go to the story . "<br /><br />alas no NOT_one NOT_listened ,  but that does not NOT_mean NOT_it NOT_should NOT_not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_said . 
8 0 this fanciful horror flick has vincent price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another .  he devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him .  his master scheme seems to back fire on him . <br /><br />price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces ,  but is still the only reason to watch this thriller .  supporting cast includes patrick o'neal ,  mary murphy ,  eva gabor and jay novello . <br /><br /> 
9 1 futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s (the origins of off off broadway) .  though it's not NOT_for NOT_everyone ,  it is a genuinely brilliant ,  darkly funny ,  even more often deeply disturbing tale about love ,  sex ,  personal liberty ,  and revenge ,  a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution .  the story is not NOT_about NOT_being NOT_gay ,  though -- it's about love and sex that don't NOT_conform NOT_to NOT_social NOT_norms NOT_and NOT_therefore NOT_must NOT_be NOT_removed NOT_through NOT_violence NOT_and NOT_hate .  on the surface ,  it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig ,  but like any great fable ,  it's not NOT_really NOT_about NOT_animals ,  it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in america . <br /><br />the stage version won international acclaim in its original production ,  it toured the u . s .  and europe ,  and with others of its kind ,  influenced almost all theatre that came after it .  luckily ,  we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived ,  with the original cast and original director ,  tom o'horgan (who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway) . <br /><br />this is not NOT_a NOT_mainstream ,  easy-to-take ,  studio film -- this is an aggressive ,  unsettling ,  glorious ,  deeply emotional ,  wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never NOT_forget .  and it just might change the way you see the world .  .  . 
10 0 i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about .  to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't NOT_make NOT_sense .  the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford!!! he is so hot ,  but in this movie his hair was kind of weird .  but still hot . <br /><br />however ,  despite how hot chace is ,  it really did not NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_the NOT_film .  i guess the plot isn't NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_but NOT_what NOT_really NOT_threw NOT_me NOT_over NOT_was NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_they NOT_cuss NOT_in NOT_like NOT_every NOT_sentence .  is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time?the cussing was annoying and the whole flashy ,  camera shaking thing gave me a headache . <br /><br />all in all ,  although the plot was ok ,  i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic .  that's why i only cut to scenes with chace in it .  lol anyways ,  not NOT_worth NOT_renting NOT_unless NOT_your NOT_a NOT_die-hard NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_a NOT_specific NOT_cast NOT_member NOT_like NOT_i NOT_was .  oh yeah the cast was hot .  the girls were hot!!! but chace is the best!! 
11 1 i came in in the middle of this film so i had no NOT_idea NOT_about NOT_any NOT_credits NOT_or NOT_even NOT_its NOT_title NOT_till NOT_i NOT_looked NOT_it NOT_up NOT_here ,  where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators .  i'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style .  my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself .  true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindler's list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars .  but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i've ever heard of his for tenderness ,  sensitivity and beauty ,  fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie .  and another recent score of his ,  for catch me if you can ,  shows still more wit and sophistication .  as to stanley and iris ,  i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack ,  that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina ,  and danny devito's renaissance man ,  etc .  they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening ,  a story which can't NOT_be NOT_told NOT_often NOT_enough .  this one is an excellent addition to that genre . 
12 0 from the beginning of the movie ,  it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something ,  what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made ,  he has gone in the opposite way ,  he had a type of move that he wanted to make ,  and wrote a story to suite it .  and he has failed in it very badly .  i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie .  any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort .  in the credit of the director ,  he knows the media that he is working with ,  what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this .  here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie .  and the actors also have given a decent performance . 
13 1 fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love . the acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography , screenplay , directing and editing . the story/script is only average at best . this film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level . it would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
14 0 this is really a new low in entertainment .  even though there are a lot worse movies out . <br /><br />in the gangster / drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not ,  i mean sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out clichã© . ) then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not . ) <br /><br />sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family .  but this movie does not NOT_go NOT_in NOT_this NOT_direction .  even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes .  wasn't NOT_he NOT_already NOT_down NOT_and NOT_out ,  why does he do it again? <br /><br />so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again ,  this movie is just not ,  because of focusing on "cool" production techniques and special effects an not NOT_giving NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_a NOT_moment NOT_to NOT_reflect NOT_and NOT_most NOT_of NOT_all NOT_forcing NOT_the NOT_story NOT_along NOT_the NOT_path NOT_where NOT_they NOT_want NOT_it NOT_to NOT_be NOT_and NOT_not NOT_paying NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_let NOT_the NOT_story NOT_breath NOT_and NOT_naturally NOT_evolve . ) <br /><br />it wants to be a drama to not NOT_glorify NOT_abuse NOT_of NOT_substances NOT_and NOT_violence NOT_(would NOT_be NOT_political NOT_incorrect NOT_these NOT_days ,  wouldn't NOT_it?) NOT_but NOT_on NOT_the NOT_other NOT_hand NOT_it NOT_is NOT_nothing NOT_more NOT_then NOT_a NOT_cheap NOT_action NOT_movie NOT_(like NOT_there NOT_are NOT_so NOT_so NOT_many NOT_out NOT_there) NOT_with NOT_an NOT_average NOT_set NOT_of NOT_actors NOT_and NOT_a NOT_vinnie NOT_jones NOT_who NOT_is NOT_managing NOT_to NOT_not NOT_totally NOT_ruin NOT_what's NOT_left NOT_of NOT_his NOT_reputation NOT_by NOT_doing NOT_what NOT_he NOT_always NOT_does . <br /><br />so all in all i  .  .  just  .  .  .  can't NOT_recommend NOT_it . <br /><br />1 for vinnie and 2 for the editing . 
15 1 although i didn't NOT_like NOT_stanley NOT_& NOT_iris NOT_tremendously NOT_as NOT_a NOT_film ,  i did admire the acting .  jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie .  i haven't always been a fan of fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time .  de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold .  he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_him NOT_anymore NOT_that NOT_will NOT_break NOT_your NOT_heart .  i wouldn't NOT_really NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_film NOT_as NOT_a NOT_great NOT_cinematic NOT_entertainment ,  but i will say you won't NOT_see NOT_much NOT_bette NOT_acting NOT_anywhere . 
16 0 6/10 acting ,  not NOT_great NOT_but NOT_some NOT_good NOT_acting . <br /><br />4/10 director ,  makes some stupid decisions for this film . <br /><br />2/10 writer ,  story makes no NOT_sense NOT_at NOT_all NOT_and NOT_has NOT_huge NOT_amount NOT_of NOT_flaws . <br /><br />4/10 overall score for this movie . <br /><br />don't waste your time with this film ,  it's not NOT_worth NOT_it .  i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much .  characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens "storywise" ,  not NOT_in NOT_good NOT_way .  because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards) .  it's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one .  in the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics 
17 1 very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves .  i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write .  this film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter ,  the live-in relatives and their quarrels ,  the troubled child who gets knocked up and then ,  typically ,  drops out of school ,  a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it .  2 thumbs up . 
18 0 this is one of the dumbest films ,  i've ever seen .  it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all . <br /><br />there's not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_good NOT_line NOT_or NOT_character NOT_in NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_mess .  if there was a plot ,  it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes ,  there's nothing good to say so ill say nothing .  i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released ,  does somebody somewhere not NOT_at NOT_some NOT_stage NOT_think ,  'oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day .  its crap like this that has people downloading illegally ,  the trailer looks like a completely different film ,  at least if you have download it ,  you haven't wasted your time or money don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time ,  this is painful . 
19 1 working-class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come ,  yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro (both terrific) .  she's a widow who can't NOT_move NOT_on ,  he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest .  adaptation of pat barker's novel "union street" (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland ,  and the film's editing is a mess ,  but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy .  there are no NOT_overtures NOT_to NOT_serious NOT_issues NOT_(even NOT_the NOT_illiteracy NOT_angle NOT_is NOT_just NOT_a NOT_plot-tool NOT_for NOT_the NOT_ensuing NOT_love NOT_story) NOT_and NOT_no NOT_real NOT_fireworks ,  though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree .  the finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't NOT_really NOT_be NOT_satisfying NOT_any NOT_other NOT_way .  *** from **** 
20 0 this film had a lot of promise ,  and the plot was relatively interesting ,  however the actors ,  director and editors seriously let this film down . <br /><br />i feel bad for the writers ,  it could have been good .  the acting is wooden ,  very few of the characters are believable . <br /><br />who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film .  there are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene ,  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying . <br /><br />i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no ,  it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money . 
21 1 i'm a male ,  not NOT_given NOT_to NOT_women's NOT_movies ,  but this is really a well done special story .  i have no NOT_personal NOT_love NOT_for NOT_jane NOT_fonda NOT_as NOT_a NOT_person NOT_but NOT_she NOT_does NOT_one NOT_hell NOT_of NOT_a NOT_fine NOT_job ,  while deniro is his usual superb self .  everything is so well done: acting ,  directing ,  visuals ,  settings ,  photography ,  casting .  if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner . 
22 0 if you look at corey large's information here on imdb ,  apparently there's a movie called "reload" in production (as of june '08) in which he's playing a character named sebastian cole . <br /><br />first of all ,  how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel  .  .  .  and second ,  didn't NOT_sebastian NOT_get NOT_killed NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_"loaded"?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i NOT_watched NOT_this NOT_in NOT_the NOT_wee NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_the NOT_morning NOT_when NOT_i NOT_was NOT_battling NOT_insomnia ,  and so i was drifting in and out while it was on .  i'm sure i missed some plot points ,  but overall ,  it seemed really weak .  large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film .  i'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls ,  since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty ,  but not NOT_exceptional . 
23 1 liked stanley & iris very much .  acting was very good .  story had a unique and interesting arrangement .  the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing .  characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings .  very enjoyable movie . 
24 0 all i could think of while watching this movie was b-grade slop .  many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events .  yet really ,  the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole . <br /><br />as far as the plot is concerned ,  it was lacklustre ,  unimaginative ,  implausible and convoluted .  you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would . <br /><br />granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action .  .  .  looks can only carry a film so far .  the action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there ,  and a final gunfight towards the end .  nothing really to write home about . <br /><br />as others have said ,  'bad' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad' ,  you revel in that fact .  this film ,  however ,  is a void .  it's nothing . <br /><br />furthermore ,  if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way .  'requiem for a dream' ,  'trainspotting' ,  'fear and loathing in las vegas' and 'candy' are just a few examples .  though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'go' (overall ,  both serious and funny) and 'halfbaked' . <br /><br />on a final note ,  the one possibly redeeming line in this movie ,  delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from 'lock ,  stock and two smokling barrels' .  to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'loaded' is vile . <br /><br />overall ,  i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not NOT_seeing NOT_this NOT_movie . 
25 1 liked stanley & iris very much .  acting was very good .  story had a unique and interesting arrangement .  the absence of violence and sex was refreshing .  characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings .  very enjoyable movie . 
26 0 weak plot ,  predictable violence ,  only semi interesting characters .  like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it "hot" .  from the predictable rap and house soundtrack ,  to the family conflicts ,  it's poorly acted ,  stereotypical ,  and ultimately terribly boring .  even the title has been done before - imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />note: saw it on showtime ,  which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies .  was halfway thru before i realized no NOT_one NOT_was NOT_an NOT_undercover NOT_cop .  even tho another stereotype ,  would have made it interesting if it happened . 
27 1 the production quality ,  cast ,  premise ,  authentic new england (waterbury ,  ct?) locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item .  unfortunately ,  all we got was a passable 2 star "decent" flick ,  mostly memorable for what it tried to do .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . bring an art house style film mainstream .  the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself ,  and if well done ,  will satisfy most grownups .  jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable .  i wondered why she wasn't NOT_doing NOT_a NOT_post NOT_doctorate NOT_at NOT_yale NOT_instead NOT_of NOT_working NOT_in NOT_a NOT_dead NOT_end NOT_factory NOT_job NOT_in NOT_waterbury .  robert diniro's character was just a bit too contrived .  an illiterate ,  nice guy loser who turns out to actually be ,  with a little help from jane's character ,  a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison . <br /><br />this genre has been more successfully handled by "nobody's fool" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) "about schmidt . " i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts . <br /><br />i'll give it an "a" for effort . 
28 0 there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent .  this was one of those times .  i almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure .  .  .  and i wish i had .  .  . <br /><br />the pace that a man goes from a straight-laced ,  controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never NOT_be NOT_this NOT_rapid . <br /><br />from a graduation celebration to the predictable ending tristan price (jesse metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman ,  by violence ,  and by mind altering substances .  of course ,  the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful april (nathalie kelley) .  but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs ,  violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand . <br /><br />frankly ,  besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena ,  this film has no NOT_redeeming NOT_qualities .  save your money ,  save your time .  .  .  do anything else .  .  . 
29 1 this film has a special place in my heart ,  as when i caught it the first time ,  i was teaching adult literacy .  it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time .  there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion ,  and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation .  <br /><br />excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work ,  a great turn by a young martha plimpton ,  an inspiring story line ,  and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience . 
30 0 this is it .  this is the one .  this is the worst movie ever made .  ever .  it beats everything .  i have never NOT_seen NOT_worse .  retire the trophy and give it to these people .  .  .  .  . there's just no NOT_comparison . <br /><br />even three days after watching this (for some reason i still don't NOT_know NOT_why) NOT_i NOT_cannot NOT_believe NOT_how NOT_insanely NOT_horrific NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_is/was .  its so bad .  so far from anything that could be considered a movie ,  a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence . <br /><br />this made me question whether or not NOT_humans NOT_are NOT_truly NOT_put NOT_on NOT_this NOT_earth NOT_to NOT_do NOT_good .  it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe .  this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society .  we should be ashamed .  i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art ,  is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good .  it's an embarrassment .  i don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_on NOT_earth NOT_any NOT_of NOT_these NOT_actors ,  writers ,  or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making "loaded" .  i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_type NOT_of NOT_disgusting NOT_monsters NOT_enjoy NOT_watching NOT_these NOT_types NOT_of NOT_movies . <br /><br />that being said ,  i love a good "bad" movie .  i love shark attack 3 ,  i love bad taste ,  they are hilarious .  i tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad" . <br /><br />but this .  .  .  .  .  .  . this crosses the line of "bad" into a whole new dimension .  this is awkward bad .  this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen ,  every line ,  every action ,  every death ,  every sequence before they happen; and not NOT_just NOT_like NOT_a NOT_second NOT_or NOT_two NOT_before ,  i mean like ,  after watching the first 5 minutes before . <br /><br />every cheesy editing "effect" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point .  i really never NOT_want NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_"shaky" NOT_camera NOT_"drug NOT_buzz NOT_rush" NOT_effect NOT_or NOT_jump NOT_cuts NOT_or NOT_swerve NOT_cuts NOT_or NOT_any NOT_fancy NOT_cut NOT_ever NOT_again NOT_ever .  this is meticulously boring ,  repetitive and just tortures the audience . <br /><br />but .  .  .  .  .  .  . and let me be specific here ,  the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production ,  it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement .  i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission ,  demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of drain-o or i will do it for him . <br /><br />if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad ,  just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again .  trust me ,  i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this . <br /><br />stop these movies ,  they are just the most vile of all facets of our society .  please .  stop .  now . 
31 1 i guess if a film has magic ,  i don't NOT_need NOT_it NOT_to NOT_be NOT_fluid NOT_or NOT_seamless .  it can skip background information ,  go too fast in some places ,  too slow in others ,  etc .  magic in this film: the scene in the library .  there are many minor flaws in stanley & iris ,  yet they don't NOT_detract NOT_from NOT_the NOT_overall NOT_positive NOT_impact NOT_of NOT_watching NOT_people NOT_help NOT_each NOT_other NOT_in NOT_areas NOT_of NOT_life NOT_that NOT_seem NOT_the NOT_most NOT_incomprehensible ,  the hardest to fix .  both characters are smart .  yet stanley can't NOT_understand NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_function NOT_because NOT_he NOT_can't NOT_read; NOT_he NOT_can't NOT_read NOT_because NOT_he's NOT_had NOT_too NOT_much NOT_adventure NOT_in NOT_his NOT_childhood .  iris ,  although well-educated ,  hasn't had enough adventure and so can't NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_to NOT_move NOT_past NOT_the NOT_u-turn NOT_her NOT_life NOT_took .  in both their faults and strengths ,  the characters compliment each other .  it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory ,  or that a stanley never NOT_hid NOT_his NOT_illiteracy NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_work NOT_in NOT_construction NOT_or NOT_some NOT_other NOT_better-paying NOT_job .  and while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of the story ,  their unfolding seems somewhat contrived .  i assume no NOT_one NOT_took NOT_the NOT_time NOT_to NOT_rethink NOT_the NOT_script .  even so ,  it's a good movieâ—just imagine what de niro ,  fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had! 
32 0 there are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie .  that's probably the best thing about it .  perhaps that even makes it worth watching . <br /><br />"loaded" tells the story of tristan price (jesse metcalfe) ,  a young man who's about to make his mark on the world .  he's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation ,  and he's on his way to law school .  but like so many such settings ,  things aren't NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_perfect NOT_as NOT_they NOT_appear .  the expectations in this family far outweigh the love .  except for school ,  tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house .  this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family ,  which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't NOT_spelled NOT_out NOT_until NOT_the NOT_very NOT_end .  tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity ,  when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation .  the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party ,  and from there ,  tristan befriends sebastian cole (corey large) ,  who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld . <br /><br />while technically well-made ,  this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't NOT_very NOT_engaging .  also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place ,  such as slow-motion ,  fast-motion ,  freeze-frames and echos .  these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs ,  except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points ,  in some cheap attempt at style . <br /><br />despite its cast of relative unknowns ,  performances were good all around ,  most notably with respect to the main antagonist (corey large) .  i suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future . <br /><br />of course ,  when mentioning the actors ,  i must mention their looks .  rating based on hotness ,  this movies scores an 11 .  the women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching .  i'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive ,  but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that . <br /><br />overall ,  i can't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie ,  not NOT_for NOT_buying ,  renting ,  or even seeing for free .  it's unfortunately just not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_effort NOT_it NOT_takes NOT_to NOT_sit NOT_through . 
33 1 i found this to be a so-so romance/drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it .  it's not NOT_a NOT_hallmark NOT_hall NOT_of NOT_fame-type NOT_family NOT_film NOT_with NOT_sleeping-before-marriage NOT_considered NOT_"normal" NOT_behavior NOT_but NOT_considering NOT_it NOT_stars NOT_jane NOT_fonda NOT_and NOT_robert NOT_de NOT_niro ,  i would have expected a lot rougher movie ,  at least language-wise .  <br /><br />the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult .  that's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but ,  to be honest ,  the film isn't NOT_that NOT_memorable . <br /><br />it's still a fairly mild ,  nice tale that i would be happy to recommend . 
34 0 nine minutes of psychedelic ,  pulsating ,  often symmetric abstract images ,  are enough to drive anyone crazy .  i did spot a full-frame eye at the start ,  and later some birds silhouetted against other colors .  it was just not NOT_my NOT_cup NOT_of NOT_tea .  it's about 8â½ minutes too long . 
35 1 this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations .  there are constant references to assembly line production ,  where workers are treated as cogs in a machine ,  overseen by managers wielding clipboards ,  controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed ,  and firing workers (stanley) who meet all criteria (as his supervisor says ,  are always on time ,  are hard workers ,  do good work) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake .  <br /><br />this system destroys families - stanley has to send his father to a nursing home (where he quickly dies) after stanley loses his job .  iris' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant .  references are made to the fact that now ,  with declining wages ,  both partners need to work ,  the implication being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids .  iris' husband is dead from an illness ,  and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care ,  the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care .  iris' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job (even the working class with no NOT_stake NOT_in NOT_conventional NOT_bourgeois NOT_notions NOT_of NOT_perfection NOT_and NOT_beauty NOT_buy NOT_into NOT_them) .  the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail (presumably ,  he's also black ,  and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates) .  she remarks that he ,  like her ,  "is doing time" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave . <br /><br />stanley ,  however ,  still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism .  he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not NOT_yet NOT_reduced NOT_human NOT_relations NOT_to NOT_a NOT_purely NOT_instrumental NOT_contract ,  as iris' brother in law does (suggesting that he "married the wrong sister") .  he does not ,  as iris says ,  conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather ,  he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way ,  in a sort of bauhaus ideal .  this was the dream of early modernists and 1920's socialists (such as the bauhaus) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs ,  allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations .  he is also outside of traditional gender relations .  he cooks ,  he cleans ,  he cares for his family ,  and he knows how to iron .  iris ,  on the other hand ,  lives in a traditionally male role - she's a factory worker ,  the mains source of income for her (extended) family ,  and she brings stanley into the public realm ,  traditionally off-limits to women .  by teaching him to read and write ,  she gives him access to the world of knowledge ,  also traditionally gendered male . <br /><br />literacy here is used as a metaphor for the (traditionally masculine) public realm and the systems of circulation (monetary ,  vehicular ,  cultural) that enable participation in the public realm .  without this access ,  stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning .  he is excluded from all regular circulations ,  unable to participate in the monetary (can't open a bank account) ,  in the vehicular (can't get a driver's license ,  can't NOT_ride NOT_the NOT_bus) ,  and in the social (he asks if he exists if he can't NOT_write NOT_his NOT_name) . <br /><br />after learning to read ,  he grabs books on auto repair ,  farming ,  and spirituality (the bible) .  the word of god is therefore relativized ,  placed on the same value plane as how-to books .  in fact ,  organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex .  it is ,  however ,  acknowledged as a moral force - iris ,  clearly a character devoted to living a "good" life ,  mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching . <br /><br />once able to read ,  he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan ,  a car ,  and a house ,  taking his place at the head of the family ,  the breadwinner .  presumably ,  he's an industrial designer ,  dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce .  this ending ,  probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film ,  is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn't NOT_forced NOT_in NOT_by NOT_some NOT_studio NOT_exec NOT_suddenly NOT_worried NOT_about NOT_the NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_a NOT_feel-good NOT_ending NOT_and NOT_its NOT_potential NOT_effect NOT_on NOT_the NOT_bottom NOT_line . <br /><br />now that ,  according to the pundits ,  we've comfortably moved on to post-industrial capitalism ,  the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel ,  as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period .  <br /><br />nevertheless ,  it's highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain .  disregard the ending ,  and it's close to a perfect 10 . 
36 0 this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972) .  regardless of the exact date ,  the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s . <br /><br />the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks .  these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no NOT_dialog NOT_or NOT_plot NOT_of NOT_any NOT_sort .  this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art ,  and like most performance art ,  it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome .  the film ,  to put it even more bluntly ,  is a total bore and would appeal to no NOT_one NOT_but NOT_perhaps NOT_those NOT_who NOT_made NOT_the NOT_film ,  their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and "with it" to be understood by us mortals . 
37 1 `stanley and iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life .  stanley's life is difficult ,  because he never NOT_learned NOT_to NOT_read NOT_or NOT_write .  iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley .  she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time .  over time they become romantically involved .  after stanley learns to read ,  he goes off to a good job in chicago ,  only to return to iris and ask her to marry him . <br /><br />it's a really good film without nudity ,  violence ,  or profanity ,  that which is rare in today's films .  a good film all round .  <br /><br /> 
38 0 i am a big fan of arnold vosloo .  finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie ,  not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_part ,  made me happy . <br /><br />unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn't NOT_like NOT_was NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film NOT_was NOT_made NOT_in NOT_an NOT_abandoned NOT_part NOT_of NOT_town NOT_and NOT_there NOT_was NOT_no NOT_background NOT_traffic NOT_or NOT_lookie NOT_loos . <br /><br />i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired ,  but arnold is an excellent actor ,  i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired . <br /><br />i love arnold vosloo ,  and he made the film viewable .  otherwise ,  i would have written it off as another lousy film . <br /><br />i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary ,  but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good .  but the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad .  there are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film . <br /><br />all in all i enjoyed the film ,  because arnold vosloo was in it . <br /><br />jackie 
39 1 i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here .  i understand he doesn't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_film ,  but his reasons are not NOT_evident .  my feeling regarding this film is that it is not NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_travel NOT_the NOT_darker NOT_roads NOT_of NOT_loneliness ,  failure ,  disappointment and sorrow .  each of these two people ,  as portrayed ,  have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry ,  yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other .  only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire ,  sentimental and sappy .  i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances .  i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions ,  but personal feelings apart ,  she is fabulous in this role .  robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities .  this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it .  this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again . 
40 0 this movie was terrible .  at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok ,  so i watched it .  the acting was terrible .  it was like the actor were almost camera shy .  everything seemed fake .  i feel bad for edward furlong ,  terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .  .  i've watched it at least 20 times .  .  .  . <br /><br />the plot was also crap .  the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines . <br /><br />on the plus side ,  it's the good kind of bad movie .  the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get ,  so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was . <br /><br />i think everybody should watch this ,  so that then we could appreciate better other ,  real ,  movies . 
41 1 'stanley and iris' show the triumph of the human spirit .  for stanley ,  it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential .  for iris ,  it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow .  the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together ,  starting and stopping ,  before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on .  in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is ,  thus being credible .  unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture .  the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances .  all in all an excellent movie .  the best thing i take from it is hope . 
42 0 what was with all the turkish actors? no NOT_offense NOT_but NOT_i NOT_thought NOT_it NOT_was NOT_all NOT_for NOT_nothing NOT_for NOT_all NOT_these NOT_actors .  the film had no NOT_script NOT_to NOT_test NOT_any NOT_actors NOT_acting NOT_skill NOT_or NOT_ability .  it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen .  he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him .  the script was so bad .  their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional .  madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't NOT_even NOT_allow NOT_him NOT_to NOT_do NOT_enough NOT_with NOT_his NOT_character NOT_to NOT_make NOT_it NOT_more NOT_interesting NOT_or NOT_3 NOT_dimensional . <br /><br />even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish .  it was really weird and they didn't NOT_sound NOT_like NOT_real NOT_guns .  a video game had better sound effects than this film .  there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang .  he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like "lets get the f#$k out of here" and what are we going to do man" .  he sounded like a girl .  as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too .  for a few seconds .  whoo hoo ! dumb film .  poor madsen .  he will bounce back .  .  . 
43 1 this may not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_memorable NOT_classic ,  but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill . <br /><br />the story revolves around iris ,  a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job ,  an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley .  iris discovers that stanley is unable to read ,  and after he loses his job ,  she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen .  of course ,  as you might predict ,  the two ,  although initially wary of involvement ,  develop feelings for each other .  .  . <br /><br />jane fonda competently plays iris ,  a woman with problems of her own ,  coping with a job lacking prospects ,  two teenage children (one pregnant) ,  an unemployed sister and her abusive husband .  however ,  robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful ,  but illiterate ,  stanley ,  bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect .  they aren't NOT_your NOT_typical NOT_charming NOT_young NOT_yuppie NOT_couple ,  as generally depicted in on screen romances ,  but an ordinary working class ,  middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles . <br /><br />i won't NOT_give NOT_the NOT_ending NOT_away ,  but it's a lovely ,  heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy ,  albeit from the perspective of a fictional character . 
44 0 i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood-not very big-names in it .  interested enough i decide to give it a shot later .  .  it was a tough to bear experience believe me .  then ,  after finally seeing the credits roll i tought 'we turks really suck at hollywood style film making .  .  this is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre .  . ' but then wait! i checked some names and no ,  they were not NOT_turkish NOT_names NOT_and NOT_no ,  this was not NOT_a NOT_turkish NOT_movie; NOT_on NOT_the NOT_contrary NOT_it NOT_was NOT_literally NOT_shot NOT_in NOT_america NOT_with NOT_an NOT_american NOT_director NOT_& NOT_crew! NOT_that NOT_made NOT_me NOT_thinking-again!- NOT_how NOT_on NOT_earth NOT_can NOT_you NOT_persuade NOT_names NOT_like NOT_micheal NOT_madsen ,  edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably .  .  that kept me thinking further .  .  how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer . by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find .  and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa i don't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_information NOT_on NOT_that- .  so bottom line this is not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie NOT_as NOT_everybody NOT_are NOT_so NOT_anxious NOT_to NOT_present NOT_as .  .  it makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't NOT_give NOT_even NOT_that NOT_affect .  .  this one at least makes you think; it makes you wonder .  .  it leaves you with disbelief .  .  and then it makes you wonder again .  . 
45 1 if you fast forward through the horrible singing ,  you will find a classic fairy tale underneath .  christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role .  his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots .  the other actors are well for their parts .  i did not NOT_find NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_acting NOT_terribly NOT_fake NOT_or NOT_awkward .  the king in particular appears a real dunce though ,  and i wonder if he is supposed to be .  i can not NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_original NOT_tale .  the special effects are typical of the eighties ,  but at least they are not NOT_overly NOT_fake NOT_like NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_computer NOT_generated NOT_fare NOT_that NOT_we NOT_see NOT_today .  overall ,  i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart . 
46 0 i rented this one on dvd without any prior knowledge .  i was suspicious seeing michael madsen appearing in a movie i have never NOT_heard NOT_of ,  but it was a freebie ,  so why not NOT_check NOT_it NOT_out . <br /><br />well my guess is that mr .  blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film . <br /><br />apparently ,  if your script and dialogs are terrible ,  even good actors cannot save the day .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_amateur NOT_actors NOT_that NOT_flood NOT_this NOT_film .  too many non-native-english-speakers play parts of native-english-speakers ,  reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not NOT_having NOT_been NOT_made NOT_into NOT_a NOT_movie .  it's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound .  the music is awful and totally out of place ,  and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play . <br /><br />i recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other ,  better ,  movies .  this is why i gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves . 
47 1 ok ,  so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung (though walken and marner ,  particularly walken ,  sounded pretty good) .  and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the "battle" with the ogre ,  and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldn't have even known about it . <br /><br />who cares? it's christopher freakin' walken ,  doing a movie based on a fairy tale ,  and he sings and dances .  his acting style fits the role very well as the devious ,  mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he's thought about seven or eight moves in advance .  and if you've ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles ,  you *know* the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trap . <br /><br />a fun film ,  and a must-see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken . 
48 0 i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one .  edward furlong ,  you're not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_you NOT_think NOT_mate ,  you can't NOT_grab NOT_on NOT_every NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_low-cost NOT_amateur NOT_crap ,  which sole intention has to be to get some bucks . <br /><br />the filming is bad ,  and i mean bad .  anyone with a camera would get the same result ,  or better . <br /><br />the acting ,  lets just say: don't NOT_go NOT_to NOT_the NOT_supermarket NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_actors .  the good ones usually come with a degree or ,  at least ,  have some damn experience! the director .  .  mr .  jon keeyes ,  please find your purpose in life ,  as a director you simply suck .  your directing is poor ,  the angles are all messed up (not in a good way) ,  the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper ,  and the damn music .  .  it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason .  and don't NOT_go NOT_for NOT_writer NOT_either ,  by the way .  making movies isn't NOT_like NOT_serving NOT_on NOT_a NOT_coffeshop ,  it requires art and skill ,  things i really doubt you'll ever have . <br /><br />instead of making a badass shootout movie ,  you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up .  .  or just go find a job on a coffeshop .  you'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night . <br /><br />vote: 1/10 (my first one) 
49 1 although this was obviously a low-budget production ,  the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing .  one of walken's few musical roles to date .  (he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel!) also starring jason connery .  a great children's story and very likable characters . 
50 0 sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale .  you begin to really ask yourself ,  what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichã©s and still be entertained?<br /><br />of course ,  it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character ,  plot device ,  and the source of all conflict and resolution in films .  character needs a gun .  gets a gun .  can't NOT_do NOT_that NOT_because NOT_he NOT_has NOT_a NOT_gun .  puts his gun down first .  oh my god what are we going to do!? he has a gun! he waves it around ,  acting more malicious than real human beings ever do .  he pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes ,  shouting questions .  the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens .  <br /><br />it's a real challenge to make such a tired ,  hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed .  this one is neither .  it has no NOT_life NOT_and NOT_no NOT_personality ,  and it will suck these components from you .  it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do .  really ,  who needs that!? so yes ,  i'll say it: i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen .  anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all . 
51 1 i never NOT_saw NOT_this NOT_when NOT_i NOT_was NOT_a NOT_kid ,  so this was seen with fresh eyes .  i had never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_it NOT_and NOT_rented NOT_it NOT_for NOT_my NOT_5 NOT_year NOT_old NOT_daughter .  plus ,  the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious .  the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre .  but the story is great .  my daughter was entranced .  i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him .  very amusing to see him dance! and if the songs weren't NOT_great ,  at least they weren't NOT_disney NOT_over-produced NOT_saccharine NOT_sweetness .  the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her ,  and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end ,  but it was mostly benign .  interestingly ,  we had recently read "puss in boots" ,  and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story .  but while staying true to almost every aspect ,  walken's acting made it believable .  great fun .  i'd watch it again with my daughter . 
52 0 assuming this won't NOT_end NOT_up NOT_a NOT_straight-to-video NOT_release ,  i would have to say void this title at all costs .  unless you're bored of good ,  well-executed movies ,  that is .  i saw this last night at afi dallas ,  and i left with 20 minutes remaining ,  simply because i didn't NOT_care NOT_anymore NOT_(about NOT_the NOT_plot ,  not NOT_about NOT_insulting NOT_the NOT_director .  .  . that is awkward) .  when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out ,  shattered window before any shots are fired .  .  . and then the window breaks with the first shot) ,  things are going to bad .  let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come .  .  . unfortunately . <br /><br />i'll spare you all the details ,  but this is sub-par in every manner ,  even the half-assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him .  and the rape scene .  .  . christ! "shut up and take it" should never NOT_be NOT_used NOT_in NOT_a NOT_rape NOT_scene .  ever . <br /><br />3/10 
53 1 when i was a kid i watched this many times over ,  and i remember whistling the "happy cat" song quite often .  all the songs are great ,  and actually memorable ,  unlike many children's musicals ,  where the songs are just stuck in for no NOT_real NOT_reason .  the scenes and costumes are lavish ,  and the acting is very well-done ,  which isn't NOT_surprising ,  considering the cast .  christopher walken is very catlike ,  and doesn't NOT_need NOT_stupid NOT_make-up ,  or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human .  and jason connery's so cute ,  as the shy and awkward miller's son ,  corin ,  who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera .  this is a really fun ,  enjoyable ,  feature-length movie ,  where unlike most fairytales ,  the characters are given personalities .  some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he's drowning; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance ,  as it's "all the rage abroad"; when walken is in the kitchen ,  dancing on the table (he's a pretty good dancer ,  too!); and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young ,  like pretending she was a miller's daughter .  i'd recommend this film to children and parents alike ,  who love magic and fairytales .  and it actually is a movie you can watch together ,  as it won't NOT_drive NOT_adults NOT_up NOT_the NOT_wall . 
54 0 terrible movie .  nuff said . <br /><br />these lines are just filler .  the movie was bad .  why i have to expand on that i don't NOT_know .  this is already a waste of my time .  i just wanted to warn others .  avoid this movie .  the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic .  bad in every way .  the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkaya's breasts .  even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene .  the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage . <br /><br />ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum .  first i waste my time watching this offal .  then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is .  totally unnecessary . 
55 1 emilio miraglio's "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen ,  mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed .  first of all ,  and of paramount importance for me ,  it has a complex ,  twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense ,  and the killer here does not NOT_come NOT_completely NOT_out NOT_of NOT_left NOT_field NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end .  the story ,  concerning a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the film's title ,  right?) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters ,  is an involving one ,  and the murderer ,  a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman ,  is both frightening and memorable .  every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses ,  and here we have quite an assortment ,  headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and ,  in one of her earlier roles ,  sybil danning ,  as a lustful tramp at barbara's fashion house .  another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy ,  hummable score ,  and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days .  gorgeous scenery? check again .  filmed largely in wurzburg ,  germany ,  the picture is a treat for the eye indeed .  ok ,  ok ,  but what about those murders? after all ,  isn't NOT_that NOT_what NOT_gialli NOT_are NOT_all NOT_about? NOT_well ,  i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings ,  shootings ,  impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out .  .  . not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_crypts ,  freaky dream sequence ,  rats and bats (and lots of 'em ,  too!) ,  the drug references ,  a rape scene ,  the obligatory red herrings and ,  in the person of ugo pagliai ,  a hunky leading man for the female viewers .  as i said ,  a perfect giallo .  and even better ,  this dvd is from the fine folks at no NOT_shame ,  and you know what that means: a gorgeous print and loads of extras ,  to boot! thanks ,  guys! 
56 0 this film is terrible .  you don't NOT_really NOT_need NOT_to NOT_read NOT_this NOT_review NOT_further .  if you are planning on watching it ,  suffice to say - don't NOT_(unless NOT_you NOT_are NOT_studying NOT_how NOT_not NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_good NOT_movie) . <br /><br />the acting is horrendous .  .  .  serious amateur hour .  throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen ,  only to find out that it is actually him! a new low even for him!!<br /><br />the plot is terrible .  people who claim that it is original or good have probably never NOT_seen NOT_a NOT_decent NOT_movie NOT_before .  even by the standard of hollywood action flicks ,  this is a terrible movie . <br /><br />don't watch it!!! go for a jog instead - at least you won't NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_killing NOT_yourself . 
57 1 and here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror .  emilio miraglia's "the red queen kills seven times" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting ,  stylish production values ,  enchanting music ,  great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences .  it's a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of italian cinema .  the storyline doesn't NOT_just NOT_introduce NOT_your NOT_average NOT_black-gloved NOT_& NOT_sexually NOT_frustrated NOT_killer ,  but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous "red queen" .  at young age ,  their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who ,  once every 100 years on april 6th ,  kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim .  fourteen years later ,  kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins .  sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit ,  but she moved to the states recently .  .  .  or has she? complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history .  her face can never NOT_be NOT_seen ,  but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim .  she's not NOT_exactly NOT_gentle NOT_either ,  as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger ,  dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! that latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence i've ever seen! what more could you possibly request? some classy and tasteful nudity ,  perhaps? the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered ,  among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning .  emilio miraglia isn't NOT_the NOT_most NOT_famous NOT_giallo-director ,  as he only made this one and the equally recommended "the night evelyn came out of the grave" ,  but his influence and importance should not NOT_be NOT_forgotten . 
58 0 i cannot stay indifferent to lars van trier's films .  i consider 'breaking the waves' nothing less than a masterpiece .  i loved 'dancer in the night' .  i admired the idea in 'dogville' but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical ,  less cinema .  'europa' which i see only now was a famous film at its time ,  succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie ,  but did not NOT_survive NOT_well NOT_the NOT_time NOT_in NOT_my NOT_opinion .  it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste . <br /><br />the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer .  treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_black NOT_and NOT_white NOT_colors NOT_of NOT_victors NOT_and NOT_vanquished ,  of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today ,  more such was novel and courageous two decades ago .  yet it is the means of expression that really do not NOT_appear NOT_fit NOT_to NOT_the NOT_task . <br /><br />the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock ,  especially his early films set in the pre-war europe ,  with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark .  the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism .  here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re-birth of germany after war ,  of its might ,  of its obsession with order and regulation ,  of punctuality and civility .  the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys .  the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post-war europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption ,  with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers ,  with the vanquished not NOT_resigned NOT_to NOT_their NOT_fate NOT_but NOT_rather NOT_willing NOT_to NOT_continue NOT_on NOT_the NOT_path NOT_of NOT_self-destruction ,  with love doubtfully mixed with treason . <br /><br />it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case .  the actions of the characters ,  especially of leopold kessler played by jean-marc barr seem confused ,  and lack credibility .  the overall cinematography seems to be not NOT_hitchcock-like NOT_but NOT_rather NOT_from NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_imitation NOT_of NOT_hitchcock NOT_in NOT_the NOT_late NOT_30s .  the usage of color over the black-and-white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative .  it is not NOT_that NOT_van NOT_trier NOT_does NOT_not NOT_master NOT_his NOT_artistic NOT_means ,  but he is too demonstrative ,  he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is .  he really is great ,  as he will show in some of his later films ,  but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone . 
59 1 there are some films that every horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see ,  and emilio miraglia's "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" aka .  "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is definitely one of them .  with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite sub-genres in horror ,  i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while ,  and even though my expectations were high ,  this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes .  miraglia's earlier giallo ,  "the night evelyn came out of the grave" (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror ,  but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite .  "the red queen kills seven times" is ,  hands down ,  one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made ,  and no NOT_lover NOT_of NOT_the NOT_genre NOT_could NOT_possibly NOT_consider NOT_missing NOT_it .  an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements ,  "the red queen" delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: an inventive and incredibly compelling plot ,  spine-chilling suspense ,  a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere ,  eerily lush colors ,  stylish murders ,  a brilliant score ,  and ,  not NOT_least ,  a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror . <br /><br />the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany .  as little girls ,  kitty wildenbrã¼ck and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people .  fourteen years later ,  kitty (barbara bouchet) has become a successful fashion photographer .  suddenly ,  people begin to get murdered .  .  .  director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style ,  atmosphere and colorful creepiness with "the night evelyn came out of the grave" and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem .  "the red queen kills seven times" is a feast for the eyes indeed ,  and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot-wise .  the haunting painting in the grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps .  the red lady (or red queen ,  as she is called in the english title) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo ,  the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own .  <br /><br />a sexy female cast is always appreciated ,  especially in a giallo ,  and this one is a prime example for that .  the ravishing barbara bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen ,  and she is a great actress too .  bouchet's presence has graded up many italian flicks ,  among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult-masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): fernando di leo's "milano calibro 9" ,  lucio fulci's giallo-highlight "don't torture a duckling" and this unforgettable gem .  apart from the wonderful miss bouchet ,  the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning ,  marina malfatti ("the night evelyn came out of the grave") ,  and other beauties who are not NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_bare NOT_it NOT_for NOT_the NOT_camera .  <br /><br />as the whole film ,  the murders are stylish and extremely elegant ,  yet frightening and macabre ,  and some of them are quite gory .  bruno nicolai's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets ,  and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting .  the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings ,  the tension-level increses with each passing minute .  "the red queen .  .  . " begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second .  overall ,  this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for .  "the red queen kills seven times" is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made ,  and a top-priority for every fan of horror and/or italian cinema to see .  10/10

64 0 sometime in 1998 ,  saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand-new ninja turtles live-action series .  naturally ,  being a fan of the tmnt back in the day ,  this obviously peaked my interest .  so when i started watching the show .  .  .  to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement .  some time later (more like recently) ,  i got a chance to revisit the series . <br /><br />first off ,  let's talk about some of the positives .  they managed to re-create the turtles' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this .  there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot .  and the turtle suits ,  while not NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_puppetry NOT_and NOT_whatnot ,  were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series . <br /><br />people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show .  but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain .  .  .  and besides ,  most fans don't NOT_realize NOT_or NOT_don't NOT_remember NOT_or NOT_just NOT_plain NOT_ignore NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_in NOT_the NOT_original NOT_comic ,  the shredder was offed in the very first issue! never NOT_mind NOT_the NOT_countless NOT_resurrections NOT_that NOT_would NOT_follow .  so on a personal standpoint ,  i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode .  i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  they end up replacing him with these original villains who ,  as stated ,  seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show .  and with these new magic-wielding generics comes a new female magic-wielding turtle ,  the infamous venus de milo .  i'll be honest; i never NOT_got NOT_comfortable NOT_with NOT_her .  i'm not NOT_against NOT_the NOT_idea NOT_of NOT_a NOT_female NOT_turtle; NOT_i'm NOT_just NOT_against NOT_the NOT_idea NOT_of NOT_one NOT_who NOT_uses NOT_magic NOT_and NOT_thus NOT_sticks NOT_out NOT_like NOT_a NOT_sore NOT_sight NOT_among NOT_a NOT_clan NOT_of NOT_ninja NOT_turtles NOT_who NOT_seem NOT_somewhat NOT_out NOT_of NOT_their NOT_domain .  i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her make-believe enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power (or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released) .  fortunately ,  they all share the spotlight together . <br /><br />next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it .  given time and maybe another season ,  i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness .  but while the idea was sound ,  the execution was flawed (although there are a couple good episodes in this series) .  as it stands ,  next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten . 
65 1 emilio miraglia's first giallo feature ,  the night evelyn came out of the grave ,  was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror - and this second film is even better! we've got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around ,  although miraglia doesn't NOT_lose NOT_the NOT_gothic NOT_horror NOT_stylings NOT_that NOT_made NOT_the NOT_earlier NOT_film NOT_such NOT_a NOT_delight .  miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around ,  and as a result it's the typical giallo labyrinth ,  with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes .  this is a definite bonus for the film ,  however ,  as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie .  the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting ,  before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle .  the legend revolves around a woman called 'the red queen' who ,  legend has it ,  returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people .  a few years later ,  murders begin to occur .  .  . <br /><br />even though he only made two giallo's ,  miraglia does have his own set of tributes .  it's obvious that the colour red is important to him ,  as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called 'evelyn' .  he likes castles ,  gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! miraglia may be no NOT_argento NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_to NOT_spilling NOT_blood ,  but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle ,  and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes .  the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_take NOT_their NOT_clothes NOT_off!

66 0 this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned .  i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce ,  even though i liked the original cartoon . <br /><br />there's this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are .  it's atrocious .  many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle ,  but that didn't NOT_bother NOT_me .  so much so that i didn't NOT_even NOT_remember NOT_her NOT_until NOT_i NOT_read NOT_about NOT_the NOT_show NOT_recently .  all in all ,  it's miserably forgettable . <br /><br />the only okay thing was the theme song .  guilty pleasure ,  they call it .  .  .  nananana ninja .  .  . 
67 1 this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways . <br /><br />directed by emilio p .  miraglia who ,  one year earlier ,  also made the very interesting "la notte che evelyn usci della tomba" (see also my comment on that one) ,  the film starts off a little slow ,  but all in all ,  no NOT_time NOT_is NOT_wasted NOT_with NOT_unnecessary NOT_sub NOT_plots NOT_or NOT_sequences . <br /><br />this film is a german-italian coproduction ,  but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "horror house" .  at least the murder scenes ,  which will satisfy every gorehound ,  are fully intact ,  and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end .  but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for ,  of course . <br /><br />a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings ,  "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia's above mentioned other thriller .

69 1 what a fun movie! if you're a giallo fan ,  red queen kills 7 times is a real winner .  to begin with ,  it's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo .  both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life .  the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy .  one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start .  the killer ,  the red queen ,  is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie .  the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful .  in fact ,  all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film .  the convoluted plot held my interest throughout .  finally ,  bruno nicolai's score may be the best i've heard from the composer .  the main theme is so memorable i haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days . <br /><br />the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale .  first ,  the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot .  if you've seen more than a couple gialli ,  you won't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_problem NOT_determining NOT_who NOT_is NOT_behind NOT_the NOT_killings .  second ,  the ending feels a little too rushed and ,  as a result ,  is a bit confusing .  i'm definitely not NOT_one NOT_who NOT_needs NOT_every NOT_plot NOT_point NOT_spelled NOT_out NOT_to NOT_me ,  but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all .  a second viewing might just clear this up . 
70 0 sexo cannibal ,  or devil hunter as it's more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences ,  starts with actress & model laura crawford (ursula buchfellner as ursula fellner) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane (gisela hahn) .  after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named chris (werner pochath) & thomas (antonio mayans) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane .  laura's agent gets on the blower to rent-a-hero peter weston (al cliver) who is informed of the situation ,  the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom .  peter is told that he will be paid 200 , 000 to get her back safely & a further 10% of the 6 million if he brings that back as well ,  faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter & his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island & deciding on how to save laura .  so ,  the kidnappers have laura & peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much .  just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe (hell ,  in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw hut ,  now that's primitive) who worship some cannibal monster dude (burt altman) with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young ,  white female flesh & intestines .  .  . <br /><br />this spanish ,  french & german co-production was co-written & directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well .  sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the 'video nasties' list in the early 80's under it's alternate devil hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned ,  having said that i have no NOT_idea NOT_why NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is NOT_one NOT_bad NOT_film NOT_& NOT_even NOT_franco ,  who isn't NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_be NOT_associated NOT_with NOT_a NOT_turkey ,  decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown .  i'd imagine even the most die-hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing .  the script by franco ,  erm sorry i mean clifford brown & julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed ,  is awful .  it's as simple & straight forward as that .  for a start the film is so boring it's untrue ,  the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things don't NOT_improve NOT_as NOT_we NOT_get NOT_a NOT_big NOT_black NOT_guy NOT_with NOT_stupid NOT_looking NOT_over-sized NOT_bloodshot NOT_eyes NOT_plus NOT_two NOT_tame NOT_cannibal NOT_scenes .  as a horror film sexo cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no NOT_more NOT_success ,  this is one to avoid . <br /><br />director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout ,  a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it's not NOT_attached NOT_to NOT_anything! NOT_the NOT_cannibal NOT_scenes NOT_are NOT_poor ,  the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'a' to 'b' & not NOT_really NOT_doing NOT_anything NOT_when NOT_they NOT_get NOT_there NOT_either .  it becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & don't NOT_forget NOT_this NOT_thing NOT_goes NOT_on NOT_for NOT_94 NOT_minutes NOT_in NOT_it's NOT_uncut NOT_state .  i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff ,  this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it's side & having cliver crawl along the floor! just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never NOT_grabs NOT_onto NOT_to NOT_anything NOT_as NOT_he NOT_just NOT_pulls NOT_himself NOT_along! NOT_the NOT_gore NOT_isn't NOT_that NOT_great NOT_& NOT_as NOT_far NOT_as NOT_euro NOT_cannibal NOT_films NOT_go NOT_this NOT_is NOT_very NOT_tame ,  there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat ,  a man is impaled on spikes ,  there's some blood & a handful of intestines .  there's a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene . <br /><br />sexo cannibal must have had a low budget & i mean low .  this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values .  the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic .  the music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen .  the acting sucks ,  the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no NOT_one NOT_in NOT_this NOT_thing NOT_can NOT_act . <br /><br />sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell .  the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross .  anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible ,  one to avoid . 
71 1 when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine ,  i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment ,  but surprise ,  surprise ,  i loved it .  convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles ,  let alone take in the ridiculous explanation .  these quibbles apart ,  however ,  the film is a dream .  fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score .  he may not NOT_be NOT_morricone NOT_but NOT_in NOT_these NOT_lighter NOT_pieces NOT_he NOT_might NOT_as NOT_well NOT_be NOT_so .  really enjoyable with lots of colour ,  plenty of sexiness ,  some gory kills and minimal police interference .  super . 
72 0 this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes .  the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle ,  up a rocky cliff ,  near a river or lake) to pad out the running time .  the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging ,  bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb .  eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing ,  gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras .  for a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didn't NOT_see NOT_an NOT_uncut NOT_version . 
73 1 another good stooge short!christine mcintyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one!she is such a great actress!the stooges are very good and especially shemp and larry!this to is a good one to watch around autumn time! 
74 0 devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the dpp 'video nasty' list ,  but it really needn't have been .  many films on the list where there for god (and dpp) only known reasons ,  and while this isn't NOT_the NOT_tamest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_bunch; NOT_there NOT_isn't NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_here NOT_that NOT_warrants NOT_banning .  .  . which is a shame because i never NOT_would NOT_have NOT_sat NOT_through NOT_it NOT_where NOT_it NOT_not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_it's NOT_on NOT_'the NOT_shopping NOT_list' .  the plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle .  a hunter is then hired to find her ,  but along the way he has to brave the natives ,  lead by a man who calls himself "the devil" (hence the title) .  the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't NOT_many NOT_scenes NOT_of NOT_interest .  it's a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z ,  venus in furs ,  faceless and she kills in ecstasy ,  but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap .  i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i've seen everything on the dpp's list (just two more to go!) ,  and i'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it ,  saw it .  but if you're not NOT_on NOT_the NOT_lookout NOT_for NOT_nasties; NOT_there NOT_really NOT_is NOT_no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_bother NOT_with NOT_this NOT_one . 
75 1 of the elements that make this the best at this point ,  i have to say #1 is christine mcintire .  shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent .  i imagine that ,  as one poster suggested ,  christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene ,  but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil ,  to be smiling at shemp's possibly dying . <br /><br />another character who helps this stand out is the goon .  his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball .  hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or ,  for that matter anywhere .  i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this ,  but hey ,  when a short is this good ,  who's going to complain .  not NOT_i . 
76 0 or anyone who was praying for the sight of al cliver wrestling a naked ,  7ft tall black guy into a full nelson ,  your film has arrived! film starlet laura crawford (ursula buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway .  what they don't NOT_count NOT_on NOT_is NOT_rugged NOT_vietnam NOT_vet NOT_peter NOT_weston NOT_(cliver) NOT_being NOT_hired NOT_by NOT_a NOT_film NOT_producer NOT_to NOT_save NOT_the NOT_girl .  and what they really didn't NOT_count NOT_on NOT_was NOT_a NOT_local NOT_tribe NOT_that NOT_likes NOT_to NOT_offer NOT_up NOT_young NOT_women NOT_to NOT_their NOT_monster NOT_cannibal NOT_god NOT_with NOT_bloodshot NOT_bug NOT_eyes . <br /><br />pretty much the same filming set up as cannibals ,  this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value ,  thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview) .  franco gets a strong eurocult supporting cast including gisela hahn (contamination) and werner pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things i ever seen as a guy who is totally not NOT_him NOT_is NOT_shown NOT_- NOT_in NOT_close NOT_up NOT_- NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_be NOT_him) .  the film features tons of nudity and the gore (tempra paint variety) is there .  the highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between cliver and antonio de cabo in the splashing waves .  sadly ,  ol' jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and ,  at times ,  agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops .  <br /><br />for the most part ,  the severin dvd looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes .  also ,  one long section of dialog is in spanish with no NOT_subs NOT_(they NOT_are NOT_an NOT_option ,  but only when you listen to the french track) .  franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about buchfellner than his cannibals star sabrina siani . 
77 1 one of the very best three stooges shorts ever .  a spooky house full of evil guys and "the goon" challenge the alert detective agency's best men .  shemp is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene .  emil sitka provides excellent support in his mr .  goodrich role ,  as the target of a murder plot .  before it's over ,  shemp's "trusty little shovel" is employed to great effect .  this 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any stooge's short and packs twice the wallop .  highly recommended . 
78 0 an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom .  the producer hires some one to go and bring her back .  complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking "god" who likes to eat naked women . <br /><br />this is a gory sleazy movie .  there is copious amounts of nudity and violence ,  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_violence NOT_against NOT_nude NOT_people .  its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being ,  and if the movie wasn't NOT_so NOT_boring NOT_this NOT_film NOT_would NOT_be NOT_a NOT_classic .  lets face it ,  despite the gore ,  the nasty sex and abuse , and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer .  the pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out .  there are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other ,  even though its ultimately all one story .  worst of all ,  almost no NOT_one NOT_says NOT_anything .  most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that "i'll do what i want" .  its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_frequent NOT_screams NOT_of NOT_the NOT_victims NOT_i'd NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_as NOT_a NOT_sleep NOT_aide . <br /><br />this is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep ,  or unless you need to see every euro-cannibal movie . <br /><br />(an aside .  videoasia just released this as part of their terror tales series .  their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles .  their print also has no NOT_opening NOT_titles) 
79 1 this is apparently one of shemp's first shorts with the stooges .  (this excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team) .  but the threesome's comedic timing is at its honed best here .  aside from the intense slapstick scenes ,  there are others more subtle ,  but just as funny .  watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot .  or watch the real object prompting moe's exclamation ,  "oh .  .  . highly polished mahogany!"<br /><br />emil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest .  and the goon may look scary ,  but he's somehow funny .  he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are "regular" people in other shorts . <br /><br />for shemp aficionados ,  this is a must have episode .  it won't NOT_disappoint . 
80 0 a model named laura is working in south america when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle .  they demand a huge ransom for her release .  peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl .  peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend jack .  they try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter .  the helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that (not going well so far) .  also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts .  in reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem .  he starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives .  the rest of the film is a bit of a blur really . <br /><br />now i'm not NOT_a NOT_massive NOT_jess NOT_franco NOT_fan ,  in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen ,  but even i can tell that this really isn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_his NOT_best NOT_efforts .  the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening .  the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show .  there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out . <br /><br />devil hunter is poorly lit (infact i don't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_was NOT_lit NOT_at NOT_all) ,  badly dubbed ,  poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't NOT_bore NOT_me .  i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it .  for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting .  another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed ,  hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes .  then for no NOT_reason NOT_at NOT_all NOT_the NOT_man NOT_in NOT_the NOT_trees NOT_head NOT_just NOT_falls NOT_of NOT_and NOT_hits NOT_the NOT_guy NOT_under NOT_him .  it has to be seen to be believed .  then of course there is the actual devil .  it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes ,  he has very blurry vision . <br /><br />the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80's here in the uk and was banned .  now why it was i have no NOT_idea .  there is very little gore at all and it's hardly a shocking film .  minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost .  the only thing i can think of is that it was never NOT_actually NOT_watched NOT_and NOT_was NOT_added NOT_to NOT_the NOT_original NOT_list NOT_because NOT_of NOT_word NOT_of NOT_mouth . <br /><br />there is not NOT_much NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_film NOT_really NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_are NOT_a NOT_massive NOT_jess NOT_franco NOT_fan .  there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle .  it would probably be more fun . <br /><br />3/10 
81 1 an ultra-nervous old man ,  "mr .  goodrich , " terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing ,  really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it ,  saying "you will be next!" <br /><br />he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier .  of course ,  it's the stooges ,  who couldn't respond because had come into the office ,  robbed them and tied them up .  some detectives! the moment poor mr .  goodrich hangs up the phone and says ,  "i feel safer already , " a monster-type goon named "nico" appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious .  we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that .  now these crooks have to deal with the "detectives" that are coming by the house for mr .  goodrich . <br /><br />some of the gags ,  like moe and larry's wrinkles ,  are getting a bit old ,  but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times .  i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt ,  as he does here with mr .  goodrich's niece ,  in a classic routine with a long ,  accordion-like camera lens .  the act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny ,  too .  shemp was so good that i didn't NOT_mind NOT_he NOT_was NOT_taking NOT_the NOT_great NOT_curly's NOT_place . <br /><br />larry ,  moe ,  curly/shemp were always great in the chase scenes ,  in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house .  that's the last six minutes in here .  at times ,  such as this film ,

NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_has NOT_been NOT_well NOT_covered NOT_by NOT_other NOT_reviewers ,  so i'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all . <br /><br />some reviews have placed the location in south america ,  others in africa ,  i thought it was in some random island in the pacific .  where exactly does this take place ,  seems to be a mystery .  the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men ,  and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums .  .  .  the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes . <br /><br />one of the "freakiest" moments in the film is when ,  "pablito" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood ,  starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny) ,  and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and "pablito" kicks it a bit for what i assume is "shits n' giggles" and the eyes actually move .  .  . <br /><br />but ,  of course ,  then the "freak" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad .  .  . <br /><br />i hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while ,  and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do .  .  .  grab a case of beers and start watching this film ,  you'll love it! if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie ,  though .  .  .  don't' bother .

84 0 of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list (devil hunter ,  bloody moon and women behind bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety ,  being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore ,  a gratuitous rape scene ,  and loads of nudity . <br /><br />gorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big ,  naked ,  bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices) . <br /><br />employed by laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom ,  brave mercenary peter weston (al cliver) and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island ,  but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross .  during the confusion ,  laura escapes into the jungle ,  but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives ,  who offer her up to their god . <br /><br />franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore ,  murky cinematography ,  rapid zooms ,  numerous crotch shots ,  out of focus imagery ,  awful sound effects ,  and ham-fisted editing .  the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (it took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing) ,  and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_me NOT_revisit NOT_this NOT_film NOT_in NOT_a NOT_hurry . 
85 1 busy phillips put in one hell of a performance ,  both comedic and dramatic .  erika christensen was good but busy stole the show .  it was a nice touch after the smokers ,  a movie starring busy ,  which wasnt all that great .  if busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster .  forget mona lisa smile ,  see home room . 
86 0 this video nasty was initially banned in britain ,  and allowed in last november without cuts . <br /><br />it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979 ,  ursula buchfellner .  the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures .  i am not NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_the NOT_purpose NOT_of NOT_that NOT_was .  it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene . <br /><br />laura (buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom .  peter (al cliver - the beyond ,  zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom .  of course ,  one of the kidnappers (antonio de cabo) manages to pass the time productively ,  while another (werner pochath) whines incessantly . <br /><br />the ransom exchange goes to hell ,  and laura runs into the jungle .  will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? oh ,  yes ,  there are cannibals in this jungle .  why do you think it was a video nasty! muriel montossã© is found by peter and his partner (antonio mayans - angel of death) on the kidnapper's boat .  montossã© is very comfortably undressed .  peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura ,  who has been captured by now .  they pass the time having sex ,  and don't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_danger NOT_approaching .  guts ,  anyone? great fight between peter and the naked devil (burt altman) . <br /><br />blood ,  decapitation ,  guts ,  lots of full frontal ,  some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (aline mess) ,  and the line ,  "they tore her heart out , " which is hilarious if you see the film . 
87 1 i liked this movie a lot .  it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy .  alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot .  my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things .  other than that it was great . 
88 0 not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_i'm NOT_referring NOT_to NOT_those NOT_who NOT_labeled NOT_this NOT_a NOT_video NOT_nasty NOT_or NOT_to NOT_the NOT_director .  .  . "devil hunter" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie . <br /><br />the plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like "cannibal ferox" and "cut and run . " chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages . ' the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico .  the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city-style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb .  and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic .  i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp . <br /><br />to make matters worse ,  this film has ultra-minimal gore ,  no NOT_real NOT_scares NOT_and NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_unnecessary NOT_penis .  not NOT_fun .  i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro-trash film; this one just fell way short . <br /><br />2 out of 10 ,  kids . 
89 1 when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick .  i was wrong .  this movie sends a powerful message about judging others .  i was deeply moved .  everyone i have encountered ,  i have recommended this movie to .  no NOT_one NOT_has NOT_come NOT_back NOT_saying NOT_it NOT_was NOT_bad .  busy ,  also did a great job with her role in this film .  i don't NOT_know NOT_much NOT_about NOT_her NOT_acting NOT_career NOT_but NOT_wow ,  they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great . <br /><br />at the beginning it was a little slow .  but after she went to the hospital .  .  .  . wow ,  the movie picks up again .  i have no NOT_idea NOT_why NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_hasn't NOT_been NOT_spoken NOT_of NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_world .  my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more .  .  . because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half . 
90 0 as the number of video nasties i've yet to see dwindles ,  this little pile of garbage popped up on my "to rent" list when i saw it was available . <br /><br />the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots .  some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip ,  though if he returns with the girl and all the money ,  he gets a significant cut .  he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and ,  wow ,  that pilot is one of the worst actors ever! granted ,  they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood .  after stealing away into the jungle ,  we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour .  now ,  this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ,  ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it .  his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack ,  and i found myself muting much of those scenes . <br /><br />oh ,  did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity? this is probably the main reason this film was banned ,  though there is one specific scene ,  about one second long ,  where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out ,  but it's not NOT_a NOT_redeeming NOT_factor NOT_for NOT_gore NOT_fans .  also ,  jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals ,  and ,  sadly ,  male as well .  so ,  if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation ,  you got it . <br /><br />i can't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_trash NOT_to NOT_anyone .  it's not NOT_even NOT_the NOT_good NOT_bad NOT_movie .  it's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then ,  if you are making your way through the list ,  leave this for the very last .  if you watch it first ,  you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list ,  which is certainly not NOT_true . 
91 1 home room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life .  it keeps you wanting to see more .  wondering what the secret alicia is hiding .  i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never NOT_lost NOT_interest .  plus i usually don't NOT_cry NOT_over NOT_movies NOT_but NOT_this NOT_one NOT_made NOT_me NOT_cry NOT_each NOT_time .  i wish i could find more movies like that one .  all in all i thought it was a great movie .  the more you watch of it the more you become part of it .  the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma ,  because it had her daughter's name on it .  my heart felt as if it had shattered just then .  and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet .  i loved it so much . 
92 0 i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties .  i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil .  laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america .  they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself "the devil" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy .  maidens are chained up .  the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner .  peter weston ,  is the devil hunter ,  who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her , 
93 1 just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time ,  picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it ,  i've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well .  avoid of all the hollywood glamour ,  special effects and stress on the "shock factor" ,  this independent film by paul f .  ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations .  taking place after a high school shooting ,  two characters alicia (busy philipps) and deanna (erika christensen) form an unlikely bond .  alicia ,  the girl with the stone heart ,  the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath .  meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again .  not NOT_stressing NOT_on NOT_the NOT_shocking NOT_event NOT_of NOT_the NOT_shooting ,  but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart .  despite its low-budget and short filming time ,  this movie is far from cheesy .  ryan pays respect to a situation he has never NOT_endured NOT_and NOT_attempts NOT_to NOT_delve NOT_into NOT_the NOT_human NOT_psyche .  with an amazing up and coming actress ,  philipps ,  adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the "doom and gloom" feeling this movie may have .  overall ,  i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it ,  i also suggest the documentary "it's a girls world" put out by cbc in 2004 ,  which deals with the topic of social bullying ,  comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal ,  quebec and the other in victoria ,  british columbia ,  the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied . 
94 0 when a man who doesn't NOT_have NOT_alzheimer's NOT_can't NOT_remember NOT_how NOT_many NOT_films NOT_he's NOT_made ,  he probably is the world's most prolific director after all .  that man is jesus franco ,  the king of so-called 'eurotrash' .  his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed ,  opaque ,  stupid ,  lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading ,  for starters) as any other franco film i've seen .  that makes it sound pretty awful ,  and it is .  .  .  yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility ,  a generous way with the baldly outrageous ,  with nudity and sleaze and violence ,  and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made .  the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out ,  even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious . <br /><br />devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour .  the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america .  there's lots of naked writhing ,  dancing ,  and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole .  you need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away ,  as these are franco's main methods of extending a film out to feature length . <br /><br />the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary .  he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning ,  apparently recorded in an echo chamber .  early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree ,  and it's hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach (or her genitals ,  sweet jesus!) . <br /><br />anyway ,  the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers .  the flakey guy has an accent which ,  as dubbed ,  is half brooklyn-american ,  half english-liverpudlian and all retarded .  all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable ,  making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest . <br /><br />not too much really happens from here on in ,  and it happens pretty sluggishly ,  studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape .  the nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads ,  and even from the monster himself .  that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero ,  but it's gotta be done at some point ,  and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera . <br /><br />the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming .  franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making ,  but he doesn't NOT_muck NOT_around NOT_with NOT_sets .  you get real islands ,  jungles ,  helicopters and mountains ,  all in widescreen .  this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam . <br /><br />ultimately ,  issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot .  if you're trying to see all the video nasties ,  you will have to watch this at some point ,  and you'll be made as restless as i was .  if you like franco ,  you'll watch this anyway .  if you fall into neither of the above categories ,  the odds are you'll never NOT_come NOT_across NOT_this NOT_film .  copies of it aren't NOT_just NOT_lying NOT_around ,  and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it .  it's franco .  lazy ,  crazy franco . 
95 1 it breaks my heart that this movie is not NOT_appreciated NOT_as NOT_it NOT_should NOT_be .  its very underrated .  people forgot what movies are really about ,  nowadays they only think about bum bum movies ,  which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends ,  like transformers ,  movies which are oriented ,  with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher ,  on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline .  its the kind of a movie what i despite most .  of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis ,  but we do not NOT_gain NOT_anything NOT_essential NOT_from NOT_that NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_movies . <br /><br />i honestly think that performance was excellent .  especially busy philipps ,  alongside with erika christensen and victor garber(whom i respect) made this movie an oscar worth .  emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing ,  its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands ,  which she deserves . 
96 0 there are some nice shots in this film ,  it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light ,  in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset . <br /><br />but it's basically more of a made for tv movie ,  and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot ,  which keeps it quite interesting viewing ,  there are no NOT_subtitles NOT_and NOT_key NOT_plot NOT_developments NOT_are NOT_unveiled NOT_in NOT_spanish ,  so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost . <br /><br />i had it as a xmas gift ,  as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented ,  and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in "a time to kill"  ,  and the "the newton boys " so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work . <br /><br />however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy ,  he has a few lines and is on screen for not NOT_very NOT_minutes NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film ,  he is basically an extra and he doesn't NOT_exactly NOT_light NOT_up NOT_the NOT_screen NOT_while NOT_he NOT_is NOT_on ,  so die hard fans ,  really not NOT_worth NOT_it NOT_from NOT_that NOT_point NOT_of NOT_view . <br /><br />the films star though ,  patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye ,  and his character is just so nice and kind and caring ,  a true saint of a guy ,  he'd be well written into a rom com . <br /><br />so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen ,  i'd recommend ,  "a time to kill"  ,  "the newton boys " "frailty" ,  "how to lose a guy in 10 days" ,  "edtv" and "amistad" and avoid too "larger than life" and "angels in the outfield" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent ,  but are quite amusing films for children ,  again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines . <br /><br />as for scorpion springit's not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_film NOT_but NOT_it NOT_also NOT_isn't NOT_screen NOT_stealing NOT_either . 
97 1 i'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor ,  sorry for that .  .  . <br /><br />this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air .  i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title ,  i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7/10 ,  that's pretty decent . <br /><br />i must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why i'm puzzled .  this is the only film made by this director .  .  . ? how come he didn't NOT_make NOT_lots NOT_of NOT_films NOT_after NOT_this NOT_rather NOT_good NOT_one .  .  . ? someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ,  ha ha ;-) <br /><br />anyway ,  i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one ,  please .  .  .  .  . ? 
98 0 a very cheesy and dull road movie ,  with the intention to be hip and modern ,  shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles ,  resulting only in sleepiness .  <br /><br />the cast is wasted ,  the writing is stupid and pretentious .  the only thing worthwhile is the top-notch lalo schifrin's soundtrack ,  really cool and also the opening sequence ,  very original and interesting .  <br /><br />run if you can ,  the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage .  of course that this has its charm ,  of watching a movie which everybody would not NOT_drop NOT_the NOT_beer NOT_glass NOT_on NOT_if NOT_it NOT_were NOT_on NOT_fire ,  but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do . 
99 1 if you "get it" ,  it's magnificent . <br /><br />if you don't ,  it's decent . <br /><br />please understand that "getting it" does not NOT_necessarily NOT_mean NOT_you've NOT_gone NOT_through NOT_a NOT_school NOT_shooting .  there is so much more to this movie that ,  at times ,  the school shooting becomes insignificant . <br /><br />above all ,  it's a movie about acceptance ,  both superficially--of a traumatic event ,  but also of people who are different for whatever reason . <br /><br />it's also a movie about unendurable pain ,  and how different people endure it .  in this case ,  the contrast between alicia's rage and deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat .  thankfully ,  the audience is given credit for being human beings; our intelligence is not NOT_insulted NOT_by NOT_a NOT_sappy ,  implausibly moralistic ending . <br /><br />above and beyond that ,  i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that .  yet i must admit ,  i cried like a lost little baby during this movie .  there were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never NOT_quite NOT_healed .  but that is not NOT_necessarily NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_thing . 
100 0 three part "horror" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not NOT_to NOT_go NOT_"out NOT_there" NOT_and NOT_(unfortunately) NOT_gives NOT_us NOT_three NOT_tales NOT_to NOT_prove NOT_why . <br /><br />the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos .  it leads up to two totally predictable twists .  still ,  it's quick (about 15 minutes) ,  violent ,  well-acted and well-done .  predictable but enjoyable . <br /><br />the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money .  his car breaks down ,  he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic .  very obvious ,  badly done and extremely slow .  even at 30 minutes this is too long .  good acting though . <br /><br />the third is just barely a horror story .  it involves a beautiful ,  lonely woman looking for mr .  right .  it has beautiful set designs ,  a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene .  but (again) predictable and not NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_scary . <br /><br />it ends very stupidly . <br /><br />all in all ,  the first one is worth watching ,  but that's it .  tune in for that one then turn it off . 
101 1 my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest .  i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later .  well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets .  it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing .  and i never NOT_in NOT_a NOT_million NOT_years NOT_would NOT_have NOT_guessed NOT_the NOT_reason NOT_why NOT_alissia NOT_had NOT_gone NOT_from NOT_this NOT_beautiful NOT_girl NOT_to NOT_an NOT_anti-social NOT_goth .  this was probably why my shirt was soaked because i've experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling .  i too would not NOT_have NOT_sought NOT_out NOT_this NOT_movie ,  but i'm sure glad i saw it .  very moving ,  very touching .  great for those who love a good drama or tear-jerker . 
102 0 this film was a major letdown .  the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing .  some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited .  the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with .  the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come .  the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics .  little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film .  fortunately ,  i've been to spain and realize this is not NOT_realistic! NOT_in NOT_addition ,  the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled ,  while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers .  the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles , as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess . i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed , this film might especially appeal to you . 
103 1 busy is so amazing! i just loved every word she has ever done- freaks and geeks ,  dawson's creek ,  white chicks ,  the smokers .  after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day .  i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel .  if someone hasn't saw is excellent movie than don't NOT_waist NOT_more NOT_time NOT_and NOT_go NOT_see NOT_it NOT_now .  i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies .  i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her! everybody who saw the movie- in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful! you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine (maxim) she looks so good there! ~danielle~ 
104 0 i was excited to view a cataluã±aâ´s film in the berlinâ´s competition .  but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious .  too much blood ,  too much time ,  too much themes for nothing .  the spanish civil war ,  like every war ,  was horrible .  the revenge ,  a very human behavior ,  not NOT_pretty NOT_at NOT_all ,  is shown in uncountable films and plays ,  as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism  .  but what mr villaronga try ,  is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the filmâ´s history .  it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie .  i advise nobody under no NOT_circumstances NOT_to NOT_go NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_film . 
105 1 this movie is incredible .  if you have the chance ,  watch it .  although ,  a warning ,  you'll cry your eyes out .  i do ,  every time i see it ,  and i own it and have watched it many times .  the performances are outstanding .  it deals with darkness and pain and loss ,  but there is hope .  this movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience ,  according to my english teacher .  also ,  if you've seen it ,  note the interesting use of shadows and light .  home room is a phenomenal movie ,  and i rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting ,  amazing plot ,  and heart-wrenching dialogue .  very tense ,  very moving .  doesn't NOT_give NOT_all NOT_the NOT_answers ,  but makes many good points about humankind 
106 0 i'm studying catalan ,  and was delighted to find el mar ,  a movie with mostly catalan dialogue ,  at my art-house video store . <br /><br />hmmm .  .  .  not NOT_so NOT_delighted NOT_to NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_it . <br /><br />yes ,  as other reviewers have said ,  it's well-made ,  and beautifully photographed .  although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent ,  it's well-acted and convincing .  (for the most part ,  that is .  .  .  would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square ,  in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) oh ,  well .  .  .  minor detail .  up to this point ,  it had something of the feel of a non-magical pan's labyrinth ,  also set in the spanish civil war . <br /><br />fast-forward ,  and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age .  francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys ,  manuel and ramallo ,  both are patients .  i know ,  but hey ,  coincidences happen . <br /><br />the problem ,  as with so many spanish movies (apologies to almodovar fans) ,  is that with one exception (francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird* .  their motivations ,  personalities ,  and dialogue are often simply incoherent . <br /><br />what's more ,  it descends into some horrific wretched excess .  be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood .  the reviewer who called it a "potboiler" is quite on track .  if it had been made 40 years ago ,  the poster would've said: see forbidden love!! rape!! murder!! mutilation!! fanaticism!! animal cruelty!! betrayal!! <br /><br />the opening sequence is not NOT_nearly NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_personalities NOT_and NOT_relationships NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_believable .  to work ,  this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters .  as it is ,  it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between "brother sun ,  sister moon" and "pulp fiction . " if that sounds like something you've got to see ,  by all means ,  enjoy .  i think i go with something that doesn't NOT_make NOT_me NOT_feel NOT_i NOT_need NOT_to NOT_take NOT_a NOT_shower NOT_to NOT_wash NOT_off NOT_the NOT_gore NOT_and NOT_gloom . <br /><br />as for the catalan ,  it's the mallorqui dialect ,  fairly different than the barcelona dialect ,  though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it . 
107 1 home room really surprised me .  in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best .  home room does not NOT_show NOT_the NOT_school NOT_shooting NOT_but NOT_rather NOT_the NOT_aftermath NOT_and NOT_the NOT_effects NOT_of NOT_the NOT_community NOT_and NOT_the NOT_town .  the movie focus' on two opposite characters .  ,  alecia(busy phillips) and deanna(erika christensen) .  alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting .  she seems to show no NOT_emotion NOT_about NOT_it .  deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim .  alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate .  meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen .  alecia and deanna are very different and do not NOT_get NOT_along NOT_at NOT_first .  eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends .  (very much in the style of the breakfast club) .  home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting .  i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone . 
108 0 the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed .  ooooof! her loins rival those of nina hartley .  this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me .  i'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv ,  where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene ,  good grief ,  reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80s .  kurt russell must have had a fun life . 
109 1 home room deals with a columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors ,  their trauma ,  guilt and denial . <br /><br />*spoilers* the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion ,  with no NOT_action NOT_footage NOT_other NOT_than NOT_the NOT_reaction NOT_of NOT_an NOT_almost NOT_teenage NOT_swat NOT_commando NOT_after NOT_shooting NOT_the NOT_high NOT_school NOT_killer .  the film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no NOT_guilty NOT_parties NOT_are NOT_left NOT_to NOT_convict NOT_and NOT_two NOT_teenage NOT_girls NOT_surviving NOT_the NOT_incident ,  played by a very young erika christensen and busy philipps . <br /><br />the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues . <br /><br />erika christensen ,  though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting .  busy philipps ,  three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me ,  blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence .  this girl was the part . <br /><br />it's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls .  gus van sant's elephant (2003) though good ,  seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting .  what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america . <br /><br />ten out of ten 
110 0 there are only two movies i would give a 1/10 to ,  this stinker and "the man who fell to earth . " i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school .  the script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence .  it completely lost me with the "hillarious" gag of someone getting shot in the butt .  goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic .  then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs ,  followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble .  the acting was terrible ,  including goldie hawn's .  i could not NOT_stand NOT_to NOT_see NOT_another NOT_movie NOT_she NOT_was NOT_in NOT_until NOT_imo NOT_she NOT_redeemed NOT_herself NOT_in NOT_everyone NOT_says NOT_i NOT_love NOT_you .  this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no NOT_effort NOT_into NOT_screenplay NOT_writing .  the worst .

112 0 outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest .  only hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice .  goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal .  .  . <br /><br /> 
113 1 this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen .  <br /><br />if this film had been directed by larry clark ,  then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place . <br /><br />instead ,  the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting ,  and how it effected the victims who survived . <br /><br />i had seen busy phillips in other films before ,  but her performance in this movie is by far ,  her best .  the only other movie that i've seen with erika christensen is "swim fan" which made me almost not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_film ,  but she turned in a very good performance herself . <br /><br />this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry .  trust me when i tell you ,  that doesn't NOT_happen NOT_very NOT_often . <br /><br />home room is a beautiful film ,  and that's all there is too it .  .  . 
114 0 what does the " executive producer " do in a movie  .  if i remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie  .  you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player  .  unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies " starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major hollywood player  ,  it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not NOT_being NOT_up NOT_to NOT_scratch NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>protocol NOT_follows NOT_the NOT_saga NOT_of NOT_one NOT_sunny NOT_davis NOT_a NOT_kooky NOT_bimboesque NOT_cocktail NOT_waitress NOT_who NOT_saves NOT_a NOT_visiting NOT_dignitary NOT_and NOT_as NOT_a NOT_reward NOT_gets NOT_made NOT_a NOT_top NOT_diplomat NOT_ .  likely ? as things progress ms davis ( who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations  .  when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what i'm saying about the story/screenplay not NOT_being NOT_up NOT_to NOT_scratch NOT_? NOT_exactly 
115 1 i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen! i was bored and looked through the t . v .  and found "home room" and it was already in about 5 min .  ,  but i got hooked .  it was so interesting and moving .  it shows what can happen in anyone's life .  i give it a 10 ,  more if possible .  the director/ writer and actors did an amazing job .  i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it .  it was great ,  drama ,  mystery ,  and more .  i cried for hours! i think that the director/ writer should write more movies like this one .  i loved it! i didn't NOT_even NOT_know NOT_about NOT_this NOT_movie ,  which is sad because it was so good .  i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see . 
116 0 when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar ,  an arab potentate visiting washington ,  d . c .  ,  his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis .  sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state .  unknown to her however ,  the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda . <br /><br />a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen ,  in an area of barren desert known as the rub al-khali ,  or empty quarter .  in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero ,  and virtually zero strategic value ,  but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government ,  who are keen to build a military base there ,  need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler .  it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department; they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem .  sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her . <br /><br />a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire ,  but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down .  possibly in 1984 the american public were not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_mood NOT_for NOT_trenchant NOT_satire NOT_on NOT_their NOT_country's NOT_foreign NOT_policy; NOT_this NOT_was ,  after all ,  the year in which ronald reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters .  (if the film had been made a couple of years later ,  in the wake of the iran/contra affair ,  its tone might have been different) . <br /><br />the film is not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_a NOT_satire NOT_as NOT_a NOT_vehicle NOT_for NOT_goldie NOT_hawn NOT_to NOT_show NOT_off NOT_her NOT_brand NOT_of NOT_cuteness NOT_and NOT_charm .  sunny is a typical goldie character- pretty ,  sweet-natured ,  naive and not NOT_too NOT_bright .  there is ,  however ,  a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone ,  and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde .  (actually ,  that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one) .  goldie tries her best to save this one ,  but never NOT_succeeds .  part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed .  on the one hand sunny is a sweet ,  innocent country girl from oregon .  on the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume .  the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl . <br /><br />the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no NOT_better NOT_than NOT_his/her NOT_material ,  and "protocol" is simply unfunny .  whatever humour exists is tired and strained ,  relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who ,  apparently ,  all lust after western women ,  particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed .  there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties ,  as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley/ nastassia kinski film "harem" ,  about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman ,  and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting .  the film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not NOT_work NOT_as NOT_a NOT_pure NOT_comedy ,  because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day "mr smith goes to washington" .  sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen's duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blahâ…â… ,  but in truth the film is no NOT_more NOT_successful NOT_as NOT_a NOT_political NOT_parable NOT_than NOT_it NOT_is NOT_as NOT_a NOT_comedy . <br /><br />goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies ,  such as "cactus flower" ,  "overboard" and ""housesitter" ,  but "protocol" is not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them .  i have not NOT_seen NOT_all NOT_of NOT_her NOT_films ,  but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst .  3/10 
117 1 caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels ,  and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing . <br /><br />i really didn't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_to NOT_expect NOT_after NOT_reading NOT_the NOT_program NOT_summary ,  but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed .  it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's ,  a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days . <br /><br />the fact that you don't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_shooting NOT_only NOT_adds NOT_to NOT_the NOT_chillness NOT_of NOT_the NOT_plot .  to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming .  and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughout . <br /><br />on the whole ,  not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_i NOT_would NOT_seek NOT_out NOT_to NOT_what ,  however i am sure glad i did see it . 
118 0 protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors .  the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary .  the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie's charm just doesn't NOT_save NOT_this NOT_movie .  unless you are a goldie hawn fan don't NOT_go NOT_out NOT_of NOT_your NOT_way NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_film . 
119 1 while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem .  i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_it NOT_was NOT_about NOT_it NOT_but NOT_i NOT_just NOT_had NOT_a NOT_gut NOT_instic NOT_about NOT_it NOT_and NOT_wow NOT_was NOT_i NOT_ever NOT_right . <br /><br />the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting .  one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle .  thrown together by fate ,  they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on . <br /><br />i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks .  because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_cast!

120 0 i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films ,  so when i saw protocol for $5 . 50 at walmart i purchased it .  although mildly amusing ,  the film never NOT_really NOT_hits NOT_it NOT_a NOT_stride .  some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no NOT_purpose . <br /><br />then ,  of course ,  there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i'm concerned .  i don't NOT_think NOT_this NOT_scene NOT_added NOT_to NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_at NOT_all .  i don't NOT_like NOT_stupid NOT_comedies NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_teach NOT_me NOT_a NOT_lesson ,  written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />in the end ,  although i'm glad to possess another hawn movie ,  i'm not NOT_sure NOT_it NOT_was NOT_really NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_money NOT_i NOT_paid NOT_for NOT_it! 
121 1 "home room" like "zero day" and "elephant" ,  was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings .  but unlike the other two films ,  "home room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting .  making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no NOT_answers . <br /><br />don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes ,  it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected "hill street blues" episode .  it is lame but bear with it ,  at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature .  i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't NOT_pick NOT_up NOT_from NOT_the NOT_remainder NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as paul f .  ryan was both the writer and the director .  while this arrangement does not NOT_guarantee NOT_a NOT_good NOT_film ,  it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features .  because the script of "home room" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen . <br /><br />ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance .  he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing .  why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey ,  the song (sarah mclaughlin's "sweet surrender") he goes out on ,  and the amazing editing of the final minute . <br /><br />the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips (alicia) and erika christensen (deanna) as the main protagonists .  although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family ,  they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before .  the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan .  what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter .  if they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed . <br /><br />a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clichã© and predictability .  but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match ,  slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability ,  only to retreat back inside themselves .  deanna's "i'm dying inside" line just tears you apart-i can't NOT_think NOT_of NOT_a NOT_moment NOT_in NOT_any NOT_other NOT_film NOT_that NOT_i NOT_felt NOT_as NOT_intensely NOT_as NOT_that NOT_one .  she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists .  deanna only makes progress when she retreats .  the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_happen . <br /><br />ultimately this not NOT_only NOT_generates NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_suspense NOT_but NOT_leaves NOT_you NOT_admiring NOT_both NOT_characters NOT_and NOT_the NOT_two NOT_actresses NOT_who NOT_brought NOT_them NOT_to NOT_life . <br /><br />then again ,  what do i know? i'm only a child . 
122 0 there's not NOT_a NOT_drop NOT_of NOT_sunshine NOT_in NOT_"the NOT_sunshine NOT_boys" ,  which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon's sole ironic moment .  simon ,  who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited) ,  equates old age with irrational behavior--and ,  worse ,  clumsy ,  galumphing ,  mean-spirited irrational behavior .  walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years ,  which begs the question "how long did vaudeville last ,  anyway?") .  burns ,  who won a supporting oscar ,  has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in ,  after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back .  the noisier the movie gets ,  the less tolerable and watchable it is .  director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn't NOT_coupled NOT_with NOT_one NOT_of NOT_neil NOT_simon's NOT_screenplays; NOT_here ,  ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur ,  hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a tv commercial) .  at this point ,  matthau was still too young for this role ,  and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering .  it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character ,  to nuance his temperament to give "the sunshine boys" some sunniness ,  yet walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf .  the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on .  *1/2 from **** 
123 1 alright ,  this film is the representation of several things .  for starters ,  this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students .  one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries .  the lead character is what several people who consider a 'loner/goth' ,  despite the movie's stating of her not NOT_being NOT_so .  she seems quite mysterious ,  but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom .  she's questioned ,  due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before .  anyhow ,  she's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society .  yet ,  due to some ,  at first unexplained events ,  she spent roughly a year out of school ,  failing the grade .  she has the desire to graduate ,  and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor ,  the girl in the hospital . <br /><br />these two leads are nearly entirely opposite ,  and they are quite that on a social level .  while alisha is a quiet ,  inwardly disturbed ,  anti-social 'goth' girl who spends her time entirely alone (even though she seems to read quite often ,  somewhat of a closet/out of the closet bookworm) ,  the other girl is a rich ,  popular 'bubbly' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ,  ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive .  i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most 'cliques' in the modern highschool ,  but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other .  while the injured girl learns a deep ,  meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world ,  alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not NOT_always NOT_the NOT_best NOT_thing . <br /><br />many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things .  either ,  a snobby ,  hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does ,  taking it out on an innocent girl ,  or the story of a seemingly trapped ,  fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not NOT_only NOT_not NOT_to NOT_judge ,  but that she is actually ,  perhaps ,  one of the most intelligent people she's known .  in other words ,  people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life ,  but it isn't NOT_about NOT_that . <br /><br />this film is about several things .  while it is about all i have stated ,  it is also representative of how people deal from a large ,  life-changing catastrophe .  truly ,  this movie is not NOT_very NOT_symbolic ,  but instead incredibly straight forward with its message ,  as long as you aren't NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_open NOT_your NOT_mind ,  and your heart ,  to some emotions you may not NOT_be NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_being NOT_portrayed NOT_so NOT_miraculously . <br /><br />overall ,  this film is one of the best i've ever seen .  the acting is brilliant ,  the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful ,  and the emotion flowing through-out this film will have anyone not NOT_only NOT_relating ,  but possibly crying .  this film is by far heart-wrenching ,  and very impactful ,  and if i ever believed any film could alter a person's life .  .  .  this would be the first that could have changed mine . <br /><br />i adored this movie ,  if you ever want a movie that's moving and impactful ,  while incredibly entertaining and real ,  watch this . 
124 0 swing! is an important film because it's one of the remaining black-produced and acted films from the 1930s .  many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable ,  but this one is in fairly good shape .  it's also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton club--a time all but forgotten today . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances ,  it's also a mess .  the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no NOT_where NOT_to NOT_save NOT_the NOT_day .  however ,  the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning .  this is because before the plot really gets going ,  you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who ,  by the way ,  totally overplays this role) ,  they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown! and ,  the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! later in the film ,  when the prima donna is behaving abominably ,  her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! it seems like the film ,  at times ,  wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they can't NOT_even NOT_do NOT_this NOT_well--with NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_acting NOT_i've NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_a NOT_very NOT_long NOT_time . <br /><br />still ,  if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters ,  bad acting and direction and poor writing) ,  this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture .  just don't NOT_say NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_warn NOT_you NOT_about NOT_the NOT_acting--it's NOT_really ,  really bad! 
125 1 i absolutely loved this movie .  i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it .  this movie had so much emotion ,  and felt so real ,  i could really sympathize with the characters .  every time i watch it ,  the ending makes me cry .  i can really identify with busy phillip's character ,  and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me . <br /><br />i think that all high schools should show this movie ,  maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing .  i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody .  especially those who have been affected by any school shooting . <br /><br />it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time . 
126 0 holy crap .  this was the worst film i have seen in a long time .  all the performances are fine ,  but there is no NOT_plot .  really! no NOT_plot! NOT_a NOT_bunch NOT_of NOT_clowns NOT_talk NOT_about NOT_this NOT_and NOT_that NOT_and NOT_that's NOT_your NOT_film .  ug .  .  .  robert duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over .  this earns him the same responses over and over .  i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it .  good performances with famous and well regarded actors ,  but the actual complete work is a steamy turd .  well ,  maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens! sack 
127 1 this movie is so misunderstood it is not NOT_even NOT_funny .  if you think of seeing this one for the shootings .  .  stay clear .  this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure .  even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do .  .  . why? fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with .  yes the language is harsh at times ,  but it suits the characters well .  there are some loose ends left or unanswered ,  but all movies have these .  the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents .  highly recommended for teens and adults . 
128 0 this movie was awful .  the ending was absolutely horrible .  there was no NOT_plot NOT_to NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_whatsoever .  the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones .  their performances were excellent! the only problem was that the movie did not NOT_do NOT_their NOT_acting NOT_performances NOT_any NOT_justice .  if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story ,  it would be worth watching .  instead ,  robert duvall's and james earl jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline .  .  . or lack thereof .  not NOT_only NOT_was NOT_i NOT_left NOT_waiting NOT_throughout NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_something NOT_to NOT_happen NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_movie .  .  .  . well an actual movie .  .  . not NOT_just NOT_utterless NOT_dialog NOT_between NOT_characters NOT_for NOT_what NOT_ended NOT_up NOT_being NOT_absolutely NOT_no NOT_reason .  it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time .  there was nothing special about any of the characters .  the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling ,  senile ,  drunk ,  old man .  nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end .  when the movie ended ,  i sat amazed .  .  . amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while .  it never NOT_happened! NOT_the NOT_cast NOT_of NOT_characters NOT_suddenly NOT_started NOT_rolling NOT_making NOT_it NOT_apparent NOT_that NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_really NOT_was NOT_over NOT_and NOT_i NOT_realized NOT_that NOT_i NOT_had NOT_just NOT_wasted NOT_2 NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_my NOT_life NOT_watching NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_absolutely NOT_no NOT_plot NOT_and NOT_no NOT_meaning .  it wasn't NOT_even NOT_a NOT_story .  the entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time .  that's it .  it was one day in the life (and death) of some southerners on a plantation .  how much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie training day)? the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent ,  but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie .  .  . if you can even call it a movie . 
129 1 this is paul f .  ryan's first and only full-length feature .  he hasn't done anything since .  however ,  he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story .  i don't NOT_know NOT_when NOT_or NOT_why NOT_the NOT_idea NOT_emerged NOT_in NOT_his NOT_head ,  but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie ,  "home room" . <br /><br />busy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia ,  a troubled girl; the ones we always see in television series .  with dark hair and black clothes; a package of cigarettes in the pocket ,  weird look and disturbing eyes (with makeup ,  of course) .  an event has occurred at her school; a shooting .  some students have died ,  and she saw everything .  now detective martin van zandt (victor garber) is investigating the case ,  and ,  as expected ,  alicia is a suspect .  but the shooting is just the genesis; the movie is not NOT_about NOT_the NOT_shooting . <br /><br />lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright (erika christensen) .  she is one of the survivors of the hospital .  the script establishes a bond between them ,  by the school principal (james pickens jr) .  he is helping all the students to recover from the event ,  but alicia doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_care .  she's isolated .  so the principal punishes her; she needs to visit deanna every day until five o' clock .  then the movie starts . <br /><br />i can't NOT_even NOT_describe NOT_how NOT_wonderfully NOT_written NOT_i NOT_think NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_is .  i can identify with the characters and the situations they live; i like reality .  these things could happen to anyone .  and the things they say are totally understandable .  they're growing up and trying to deal with things they haven't experienced; they're doing their best .  without knowing it ,  alicia (when she visits deanna for the first time) and deanna (when she sees alicia standing in front of her) are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high school . <br /><br />the director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well .  look the contrast between them .  deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts; no NOT_complexity NOT_inside NOT_of NOT_her NOT_mind .  when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks: "who has brought them?" .  "many people" ,  deanna answers; although some days later we learn they're from her parents ,  who come every week .  the parental figures are all well represented ,  but are not NOT_as NOT_important NOT_as NOT_their NOT_sons' NOT_characters .  deanna is lonely .  alicia seems mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking roughly .  but after two days of visiting ,  she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day; even sleeping in deanna's room all night .  when they both have a fight afterwards ,  i believe deanna says: "why do you keep coming back?" .  alicia is lonely too . <br /><br />the ending of the movie ,  without ruining it ,  comes a bit disappointing; it's something i wasn't NOT_waiting NOT_for .  it eliminates some of the strength the movie has .  the revelation comes totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax the movie could have had .  it was an excellent script anyway; and an excellent direction .  a damn fine movie . <br /><br />when it comes to erika christensen ,  this was the role she needed to fly higher .  her role in "traffic" was impressing ,  but this was the big step; the main role .  maybe not NOT_many NOT_had NOT_the NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_see NOT_her NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film ,  and that's a pity .  she hasn't made one false move since then .  she has even come out with good performances in awful movies .  on the other hand ,  busy philipps ,  who proved to be very promising in this movie (what a transformation) ,  hasn't got many opportunities for other roles . <br /><br />the same i say about paul f .  ryan (in directing ,  of curse) ,  and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script; i'm waiting for his next movie .  i'm hoping the best for all of them . 
130 0 i don't NOT_quite NOT_get NOT_the NOT_rating NOT_for NOT_the NOT_amati NOT_girls NOT_and NOT_i NOT_think NOT_i NOT_was NOT_really NOT_kind NOT_giving NOT_it NOT_a NOT_4 NOT_out NOT_of NOT_10 .  what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes .  there are so many clichã©s in that flick ,  the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake .  there's no NOT_real NOT_passion NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_a NOT_bunch NOT_of NOT_actors NOT_over-acting NOT_over NOT_any NOT_limits NOT_that NOT_it NOT_hurts .  it's not NOT_funny NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_comedy ,  it's too fake-sad to really touch ,  so in my eyes it's just not NOT_good .  watching it i couldn't believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland .  but .  .  maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation? who knows .  definitely one of the oddest movies i've ever seen and this certainly not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_good NOT_way! NOT_sorry . 
131 1 this film isn't NOT_just NOT_about NOT_a NOT_school NOT_shooting ,  in fact its never NOT_even NOT_seen .  but that just adds to the power this film has .  its about people and how they deal with tragedy .  i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them .  the acting is superb .  all three main actors (busy phillips ,  erika christensen and victor garber) are excellent in their roles .  .  . i highly recommend this film to anyone .  its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it .  it provokes discussion of not NOT_only NOT_school NOT_shootings NOT_but NOT_of NOT_human NOT_emotions NOT_and NOT_reactions NOT_to NOT_all NOT_forms NOT_of NOT_tragedy .  it is a tear-jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again 
132 0 i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor ,  so i gave it a chance ,  from director gregor jordan (buffalo soldiers) .  basically ned kelly (heath ledger) is set up by the police ,  especially superintendent francis hare (geoffrey rush) ,  he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names .  that's really all i can say about the story ,  as i wasn't NOT_paying NOT_the NOT_fullest NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_be NOT_honest .  also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne ,  naomi watts as julia cook ,  laurence kinlan as dan kelly ,  philip barantini as steve hart ,  joel edgerton as aaron sherritt ,  kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick ,  kerry condon as kate kelly ,  emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott .  ledger makes a pretty good performance ,  for what it's worth ,  and the film does have it's eye-catching moments ,  particularly with a gun battle towards the end ,  but i can't NOT_say NOT_i NOT_enjoyed NOT_it NOT_as NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_look NOT_at NOT_it NOT_all .  okay! 
133 1 "home room" came as a total surprise .  not NOT_having NOT_a NOT_clue NOT_as NOT_to NOT_what NOT_it NOT_was NOT_all NOT_about ,  it paid off big time because it doesn't NOT_hold NOT_any NOT_punches NOT_and NOT_what NOT_we NOT_see NOT_is NOT_how NOT_lives NOT_are NOT_changed NOT_by NOT_the NOT_act NOT_of NOT_a NOT_disgruntled NOT_young NOT_man NOT_who NOT_decided NOT_to NOT_victimize NOT_his NOT_class NOT_mates ,  who are the innocent victims of his rash actions . <br /><br />paul ryan ,  the director ,  who is working and editing his own material ,  is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast . <br /><br />alicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school .  she has been away a couple of years and doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_in NOT_the NOT_same NOT_wave NOT_length NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_students .  for one ,  she is a rebel with a punk look ,  lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit .  alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died ,  supposedly killed by her boyfriend .  alicia ,  we realize ,  is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life ,  but we are not NOT_given NOT_any NOT_clues NOT_to NOT_that NOT_effect . <br /><br />what follows is the aftermath of the tragedy ,  as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it .  deanna cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school ,  at all .  when a ricochet bullet hit her ,  she is hospitalized with more than a wound .  she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't NOT_let NOT_her NOT_forget . <br /><br />alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal .  since she doesn't NOT_cooperate NOT_with NOT_the NOT_police ,  the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows .  alicia dislikes deanna ,  but in a matter of days ,  both girls will make peace .  we don't NOT_realize NOT_until NOT_the NOT_last NOT_sequence NOT_what NOT_really NOT_happened NOT_that NOT_horrible NOT_day NOT_in NOT_school . <br /><br />busy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika christiansen is equally good as deanna .  victor garber ,  james pinkins ,  taylor holland ,  and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble . <br /><br />the film has an intensity because it's not NOT_explicit NOT_in NOT_showing NOT_how NOT_the NOT_shootings NOT_occurred ,  which helps the tone that mr .  ryan wanted to give this movie . 
134 0 from the very beginning ,  the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed ,  that the outcome is entirely predictable .  any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters ,  incorporating character arcs ,  and three act structure .  in this film you will find none of that .  the police are the baddies ,  and consequently are shown as shallow ,  incompetent and cowards .  it never NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_occur NOT_to NOT_the NOT_makers NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film NOT_that NOT_police NOT_might NOT_be NOT_honourable NOT_citizens NOT_who NOT_see NOT_joining NOT_the NOT_police NOT_as NOT_a NOT_good NOT_way NOT_to NOT_contribute NOT_to NOT_the NOT_wellbeing NOT_of NOT_society . <br /><br />the viewer gets no NOT_opportunity NOT_to NOT_make NOT_up NOT_his NOT_or NOT_her NOT_mind NOT_on NOT_whether NOT_ned NOT_kelly NOT_is NOT_a NOT_good NOT_guy NOT_or NOT_a NOT_ruthless NOT_villain .  the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse ,  but we get no NOT_clue NOT_as NOT_to NOT_his NOT_guilt NOT_or NOT_innocence .  we see him walk through the door of a gaol ,  but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue . <br /><br />this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression .  i found the film a real chore to watch .  it is the direction for modern films ,  and this one put me off watching any more . 
135 1 the industry dropped the ball on this .  the trailer does not NOT_do NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_justice NOT_and NOT_when NOT_this NOT_opened NOT_it NOT_was NOT_on NOT_a NOT_hand NOT_full NOT_of NOT_screens .  had people had an opportunity to see this ,  work of mouth would have made it very successful .  the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters .  i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or (ebert and roeper) in his book .  an example of a great film that never NOT_got NOT_fully NOT_released NOT_except NOT_on NOT_a NOT_few NOT_screens .  which gave it no NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seen .  some movies go to video quickly because they aren't NOT_that NOT_good .  this is oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never NOT_even NOT_hear NOT_of NOT_it .  maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable .  if you haven't see this movie you should .  great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie .  it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films .  girl interrupted comes to mind .  if you like that you will like this .  <br /><br />both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic .  even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not NOT_come NOT_off NOT_as NOT_stereotypical NOT_characters NOT_or NOT_as NOT_melodramatic .  the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school .  erica is even better in this than in traffic .  i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine .  see this movie and if you like ,  recommend to friends so it doesn't NOT_get NOT_lost NOT_among NOT_all NOT_the NOT_blockbuster NOT_crap NOT_that NOT_comes NOT_out NOT_every NOT_year .  this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records .  what kind of word are we living in? aghhh .  so to make the world right again see this and recommend it . 
136 0 ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful .  it's an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america .  also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent .  .  . it is the worst film i have seen in a long time 
137 1 why a stupid ,  boring ,  crappy overrated film series like "star wars" gets all the hype ,  and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un-noticed .  .  is beyond me .  .  .  this movie will really open your eyes to the dark ,  disturbing ,  sad ,  and scary world we live in .  .  . <br /><br />unlike the boring "elephant" ,  this movie isn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_those NOT_"just NOT_a NOT_typical NOT_day NOT_until NOT_someome NOT_pulls NOT_the NOT_trigger" NOT_movies .  .  this movie focuses more on what happens after the event .  .  . <br /><br />deana ,  played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen ,  is a happy and healthy straight-a student with great friends and a great life .  .  .  until .  .  .  she is injured on the day of the shooting ,  by being shot in the head .  .  luckily she is not NOT_killed ,  but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while ,  causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain ,  in addition to the physical .  .  . <br /><br />meanwhile ,  alicia ,  played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips ,  is a nasty ,  cold-hearted ,  rebellious ,  anti-social goth girl who doesn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_single NOT_positive NOT_trait NOT_on NOT_her .  .  .  and she is unharmed when the shooting happens .  .  because it turns out ,  she was friends with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did .  .  .  which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions .  .  when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen ,  they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something .  .  .  and she still doesn't ,  so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students ,  and after she walks out on that .  .  .  the principal decides enough is enough ,  and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital .  .  of course she refuses this too ,  but the principal says that if alicia doesn't NOT_do NOT_this ,  the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something .  .  and so she actually goes to see her .  .  . <br /><br />the lonely ,  traumatized ,  and both physically and emotionally wounded deana is more than happy to have someone visit her ,  but of course ,  alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her .  .  deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome ,  but of course ,  alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced ,  and has no NOT_intention NOT_of NOT_being NOT_friendly NOT_with NOT_her NOT_at NOT_all .  but sooner or later ,  that intention will change .  .  .  (and that's all i'll say :) this is truly one of the most moving movies ever ,  as well as one of the most dark and disturbing .  .  actually ,  i think i would tie this with "american history x" as equally disturbing and moving at the same time .  .  . <br /><br />warning: watch this movie at your own risk!! it contains very graphic scenes and images! excellent and criminally under-appreciated movie! i feel so ashamed that i'm pretty much the only one that knows about it! 
138 0 i thought this was a very clunky ,  uninvolving version of a famous australian story .  heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles ,  and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical . <br /><br />the beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout ,  and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing .  and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted ,  like a very bad tv soap . <br /><br />i was really looking forward to this movie ,  and hoping for something a lot better .  the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version ,  but not NOT_by NOT_much . 
139 1 i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time i even thought going to bed ,  something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime . <br /><br />this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film ,  but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings .  and even better ,  the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out ,  a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie .  this film not NOT_only NOT_doesn't NOT_follow NOT_the NOT_formula ,  it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards . <br /><br />i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started .  up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have .  it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film ,  having a relative who suffers from a mental illness ,  i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses .  bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues .  and for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital (i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_any NOT_particulars) ,  you're dead wrong on that too - i've been there .  the script was so real it was amazing . <br /><br />go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late .  someday they'll thank you for it . 
140 0 this movie never NOT_made NOT_it NOT_to NOT_theaters NOT_in NOT_our NOT_area ,  so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it .  for once ,  i should listened to the critics and passed on this one . <br /><br />despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing .  i can see now why it went straight to video .  <br /><br />i had thought that with bloom ,  ledger ,  and rush it could have some value .  all have done wonderful work in the past .  <br /><br />the movie was slow moving and never NOT_pulled NOT_me NOT_in .  i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end .  <br /><br />i do not NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_film NOT_even NOT_if NOT_you NOT_are NOT_thinking NOT_of NOT_renting NOT_it NOT_for NOT_only NOT_for NOT_'eye NOT_candy' NOT_purposes .  it won't NOT_satisfy NOT_even NOT_that . 
141 1 what a surprise; two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film .  this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic .  this film certainly should be in oscar contention .  see this movie! 
142 0 this movie was so unrelentingly bad ,  i could hardly believe i was watching it .  the directing ,  editing ,  production ,  and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't NOT_know NOT_all NOT_that NOT_much NOT_about NOT_movies .  there was no NOT_narrative NOT_flow NOT_that NOT_made NOT_any NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_sense .  big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no NOT_where NOT_and NOT_are NOT_not NOT_set NOT_up NOT_like NOT_they NOT_would NOT_have NOT_been NOT_in NOT_a NOT_more NOT_elegantly NOT_and NOT_effectively NOT_made NOT_film .  the characters are sadly underdeveloped ,  making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them .  the acting ,  surprisingly ,  is not NOT_entirely NOT_bad ,  but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances .  the film plays like a particularly bad t . v .  western/epic ,  and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell .  i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter .  that's all very well ,  but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_good .  no NOT_one NOT_is NOT_saying NOT_that NOT_the NOT_subject NOT_matter NOT_isn't NOT_good ,  just the quality of the movie itself .  pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans ,  but that doesn't NOT_mean NOT_i'm NOT_going NOT_to NOT_defend NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_say NOT_it NOT_was NOT_good ,  because it was still bad .  a failure all around ,  though heath and orlando are lovely to look at . 
143 1 i couldn't believe the comments made about the movie . <br /><br />as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i did . <br /><br />what i viewed was incredible! i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie . <br /><br />i hadn't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i'd have to say its the most believable movie that i've seen in a long time .  <br /><br />what i don't NOT_see NOT_is NOT_why NOT_everyone NOT_has NOT_such NOT_a NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_deanna's NOT_choice NOT_of NOT_drug NOT_in NOT_the NOT_attempt NOT_of NOT_suicide NOT_scene ,  from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice .  that i don't NOT_understand ,  its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see .  i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend .  opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded .  i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great roles . <br /><br />busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her! you go girl! 
144 0 if the term itself were not NOT_geographically NOT_and NOT_semantically NOT_meaningless ,  one might well refer to "ned kelly" as an "australian western . " for the people down under ,  ned kelly was ,  apparently ,  a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood ,  jesse james ,  bonnie and clyde ,  and butch cassidy and the sundance kid .  the descendant of irish immigrants ,  kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer ,  a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison .  to get back at the government for this mistreatment ,  kelly ,  his brother dan ,  and two other companions ,  became notorious bank robbers ,  winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country . <br /><br />perhaps because we've encountered this "gentleman bandit" scenario so many times in the past ,  "ned kelly" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichã©s on its way to the inevitable showdown .  ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and ,  even then ,  only with the deepest regret .  he also has the pulse of the common folk ,  as when ,  in the middle of a bank robbery ,  he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers ,  after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it .  what movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? it's acts of selective generosity like this ,  of course ,  that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo .  geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment .  there's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers ,  so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle .  and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another . <br /><br />heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role ,  providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging .  it doesn't NOT_help NOT_that NOT_he NOT_has NOT_been NOT_forced NOT_to NOT_provide NOT_a NOT_droning NOT_voice-over NOT_narration NOT_that NOT_underlines NOT_the NOT_sanctimoniousness NOT_and NOT_pretentiousness NOT_of NOT_both NOT_the NOT_character NOT_and NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />"ned kelly" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history ,  but as an entertainment ,  it's just the same old story told with different accents . 
145 1 i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies .  price portrays don gallico ,  a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife ,  portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor) .  even though price is a murderer ,  i actually found myself rooting for him ,  he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him . <br /><br />although this movie doesn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_"horror" NOT_factor NOT_of NOT_some NOT_of NOT_his NOT_more NOT_famous NOT_roles NOT_(such NOT_as NOT_my NOT_favorite ,  "house of wax") it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest .  <br /><br />this is a must for vincent price fans . 
146 0 this has to be the worst piece of garbage i've seen in a while . <br /><br />heath ledger is a heartthrob? he looked deformed .  i wish i'd known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him .  <br /><br />orlando bloom is a heartthrob? with the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him ,  i can't NOT_say NOT_i NOT_agree . <br /><br />rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self ,  but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set .  <br /><br />i'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? this is a far cry from butch cassidy ,  which actually was an entertaining film .  this was trite ,  cliche-ridden and boring .  we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better .  it didn't . <br /><br />the last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious .  heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel ,  and women and children are dying because of their presence .  that's not NOT_funny .  but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on ,  because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail .  i kept waiting for them to say "i'll bite yer leg off!" we were howling with laughter ,  as were several other warped members of the audience .  when we left ,  pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was . <br /><br />i may not NOT_have NOT_paid NOT_cash NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_disaster NOT_(sneak NOT_preview) ,  but it certainly wasn't NOT_free .  it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never NOT_get NOT_back . 
147 1 this is essentially a variation on house of wax  , in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies  , vincent price . in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other , less talented and less scrupulous people  . in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist  , the great rinaldo (john emery)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs . price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi .  he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer . <br /><br />price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy . the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease  . <br /><br />good solid b movie melodrama  ,  this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't NOT_expect NOT_a NOT_masterpiece NOT_ . shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance 
148 0 they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid ,  and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent ,  the bored young wives of wealthy older men .  ok ,  there are lots of myths about ned kelly ,  but there are also a lot of well documented facts ,  still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation .  i mean ,  this is not NOT_the NOT_robin NOT_hood NOT_story ,  not NOT_the NOT_arthurian NOT_legends ,  not NOT_beowulf ,  not NOT_someone NOT_whose NOT_life NOT_is NOT_so NOT_shrouded NOT_in NOT_the NOT_mists NOT_of NOT_many NOT_many NOT_centuries NOT_past NOT_that NOT_any NOT_recreation NOT_of NOT_their NOT_life NOT_and NOT_times NOT_is NOT_99% NOT_guesswork .  it's only a couple of lifetimes ago .  my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged .  <br /><br />so it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story .  having recently read peter carey's excellent novel "the true history of the kelly gang" i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein .  but no ,  the fact is that mick jagger's much derided 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality ,  and a better movie overall ,  which isn't NOT_saying NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_lot NOT_for NOT_it . <br /><br />glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd! i'll give it 3/10 ,  and that's only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous . 
149 1 basically the exact same movie as "house of wax" - vincent price's first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares ,  because "the mad magician" offers just as many sheer thrills ,  delightful period set-pieces ,  joyous 3-d effects ,  sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! "never change a winning team" is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price's character don gallico ,  another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him .  don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled "the girl and the buzz saw" .  gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose ,  stating that all of gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company .  the sleazy and relentless ormond ,  who by the way also ransacked gallico's once beloved wife ,  takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico's rival the great rinaldi .  inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond ,  but â– also being a master of creating disguises â– recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life .  "the mad magician" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in grand guignol style ,  with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part) .  the 3-d delights near the beginning of the film ,  like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains ,  merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50's hype ,  but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them .  "the mad magician" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view ,  as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era .  needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film ,  as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in .  like no NOT_other NOT_actor NOT_could NOT_ever NOT_accomplish ,  price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way .  you pity don gallico ,  yet at the same time you fear him enormously .  you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death .  vincent price simply was a genius actor and ,  in my humble opinion ,  the embodiment of the horror genre . 
150 0 ned kelly (ledger) ,  the infamous australian outlaw and legend .  sort of like robin hood ,  with a mix of billy the kid ,  australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression ,  and united the lower classes to change australia forever .  the fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film .  indeed ,  quite a few so called `facts' in this film are ,  on reflection ,  a tad dubious . <br /><br />i suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when ,  in the opening credits ,  it was claimed that this film is based upon the book ,  `our sunshine' .  if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book ,  there it was .  this wasn't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_historical NOT_epic ,  but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly ,  albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! the story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never NOT_has NOT_a NOT_film NOT_plodded NOT_so NOT_slowly!) NOT_the NOT_feeling NOT_of NOT_numbness NOT_after NOT_the NOT_two NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_pure NOT_drivel NOT_brought NOT_back NOT_memories NOT_of NOT_costner's NOT_awful NOT_wyatt NOT_earp NOT_all NOT_those NOT_years NOT_ago .  simply put ,  nothing happens in the film ,  but it takes a long time getting to that nothing .  this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't) .  however ,  unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent ,  then you're gonna be disappointed .  between that ,  the game of `who has the stupidest beard?' ,  `spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue ,  they are all ginger for some reason) ,  and `nature in australia . including lions' ,  it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark ,  the history channel ,  discovery channel ,  and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover .  yup ,  nature pops up a lot ,  as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty) ,  the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots ,  and once all the native species are shown ,  here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people) . <br /><br />this is a turgid ,  emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv .  there isn't NOT_even NOT_one NOT_good NOT_word NOT_i NOT_can NOT_say NOT_about NOT_this NOT_film .  even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here .  when one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal ,  i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head! 
151 1 the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films ,  some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time .  price's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s ,  with films such as roger corman's brilliant poe-cycle (still the greatest horror cycle of all-time) ,  michael reeves' "witchfinder general" (1968) or ubaldo ragona's "the last man on earth" (1964) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career .  the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is ,  however date back to the 50s ,  with "house of wax" (1953) marking his rise to stardom .  "the mad magician" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor .  this is not NOT_to NOT_say ,  however ,  that this film isn't NOT_an NOT_original ,  delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself .  as the lines above may suggest ,  vincent price is my favorite actor ,  and ,  while i personally would not NOT_allow NOT_myself NOT_to NOT_miss NOT_anything NOT_the NOT_man NOT_has NOT_been NOT_in ,  none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem . <br /><br />price stars as don galico (aka .  galico the great) ,  an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices ,  whose boss ,  a sleazy businessman ,  stole his wife (eva gabor) from him .  when the boss takes away one of galico's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival ,  the great rinaldi (john emery) ,  galico snaps ,  and a murderous spree of revenge begins .  .  . <br /><br />don't we love vincent price when he's out for revenge? some of his most famous and greatest films such as "the abominable dr .  phibes" (1971) or "theater of blood" (1973) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders ,  and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no NOT_one NOT_takes NOT_revenge NOT_as NOT_vincent NOT_price NOT_does .  this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price ,  who ,  as always ,  delivers a brilliant performance ,  and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan .  another must-see for my fellow price fans . 
152 0 i saw this at the premiere in melbourne<br /><br />it is shallow ,  two-dimensional ,  unaffecting and ,  hard to believe given the subject matter ,  boring .  the actors are passable ,  but they didn't NOT_have NOT_much NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with NOT_given NOT_the NOT_very NOT_plodding NOT_and NOT_unimpressive NOT_script .  for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be over-intellectualised ,  you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all ,  told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards .  however ,  it doesn't NOT_work NOT_as NOT_a NOT_popcorn NOT_film NOT_either .  its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner . <br /><br />i very much doubt gregor jordan could sit back and say to himself "this is the best i could have done with the material" . <br /><br />ned kelly is a fascinating figure ,  and equally so is the national response to him .  possibly folk genius ,  possibly class warrior ,  possibly psychopath and probably all these things ,  he has dominated australian true mythology for over 120 years .  once again ,  his story has failed miserably on the big screen . <br /><br />such is life . 
153 1 vincent price's follow-up to house of wax (1953) ,  the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon ,  similarly revolves around a bitter â– albeit resourceful â– showman .  though a remake ,  the former (shot in technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said ,  apart from some resistible comic relief ,  the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-d showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head?) ,  this offers more than enough grand guignol-type thrills and overall camp value (price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on its own two feet .  incidentally ,  director brahm's involvement here proves no NOT_mere NOT_coincidence NOT_â– NOT_since NOT_the NOT_narrative NOT_incorporates NOT_elements NOT_from NOT_two NOT_horror NOT_titles NOT_(both NOT_starring NOT_laird NOT_cregar) NOT_he NOT_had NOT_previously NOT_helmed NOT_i . e .  the lodger (1944) and hangover square (1945) .  the young leads are played by mary murphy (as price's ingã©nue assistant) and patrick o'neal (as her police detective boyfriend â– curiously enough ,  he would himself take the lead in a similar piece ,  chamber of horrors [1966] ,  which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one) .  an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique ,  fingerprinting ,  which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall (in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax)â…though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run! watching the star in a made-to-measure role ,  the film emerges a good deal of fun â– particularly at a compact 73 minutes . 
154 0 i saw this film opening weekend in australia ,  anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger ,  edgerton ,  bloom ,  watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me .  unfortunately ,  despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role ,  the plot was paper thin .  .  .  . which doesn't NOT_inspire NOT_me NOT_to NOT_read NOT_"our NOT_sunshine" .  there were some other plus points ,  the support acting from edgerton in particular ,  assured direction from jordan (confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well) ,  and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush ,  much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it .  but i can't NOT_help NOT_feeling NOT_that NOT_another NOT_opportunity NOT_has NOT_been NOT_missed NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_the NOT_real NOT_story NOT_of NOT_an NOT_australian NOT_folk NOT_hero NOT_(or NOT_was NOT_he?) .  .  .  . in what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us .  oh well ,  at least jordan and the producers didn't NOT_agree NOT_to NOT_lose NOT_the NOT_beards NOT_just NOT_to NOT_please NOT_universal .  .  . <br /><br />guess i will just have to content myself with peter carey's excellent "secret history of the kelly gang" .  4/10 
155 1 the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician .  however ,  mid-way through the very successful show ,  the police come and shut him down .  it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created--even those he made on his own time at home .  as a result ,  price justifiably kills the evil man .  the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing ,  because price was a bit mad ,  he just couldn't stop at one (sort of like eating lay's potato chips) . <br /><br />the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows) ,  great plot twists as well as exciting action .  one thing you can't NOT_say NOT_about NOT_this NOT_film NOT_is NOT_that NOT_it NOT_is NOT_dull .  while it's also far from subtle ,  it is fun throughout ,  though and well worth a look . <br /><br />had i never NOT_seen NOT_vincent NOT_price's NOT_version NOT_of NOT_house NOT_of NOT_wax ,  i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 .  that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film ,  it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it (house of wax) .  the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful ,  the formula was re-hashed in the follow-up film .  both were made in 3-d ,  both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't NOT_stop NOT_once NOT_he's NOT_committed NOT_the NOT_first NOT_and NOT_both NOT_are NOT_great NOT_fun NOT_to NOT_watch .  the biggest differences ,  and there are few ,  are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery . <br /><br />my advice is to see this film and house of wax (the price version only) .  they are both terrific 1950s horror films . 
156 0 the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story .  .  . it's something i would have done my 1st year in film school .  very sad .  additionally ,  the story just seemed to drag on for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason .  .  . there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story ,  which makes me feel that the creative team didn't NOT_really NOT_know NOT_what NOT_they NOT_were NOT_doing ,  or just that it should have been shorter .  .  . which would have been a blessing ,  not NOT_a NOT_crime .  as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week .  .  . i'd have to say that this was by far the worst ,  and i just wanted to warn others not NOT_to NOT_start NOT_with NOT_this NOT_one . 
157 1 even though it has one of the standard "revenge price plots , " this film is my favorite of vincent price's work .  gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability .  when you watch it ,  you feel for him ,  you feel his frustration ,  the injustices against him ,  and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance ,  even though he frightens you a little with his original fury .  as the film goes on ,  his character becomes tragic .  he's committed his murder ,  but now he must kill to cover that up .  and again to cover that one up .  and again .  .  .  your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood .  even if the revenge story is of old ,  the plot devices themselves are original- gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways .  a shame this one isn't NOT_available NOT_for NOT_home NOT_veiwing . 
158 0 the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't NOT_do NOT_for NOT_the NOT_tv NOT_series NOT_because NOT_most NOT_people NOT_watch NOT_for NOT_the NOT_1930s NOT_style .  ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too .  hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing .  all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time .  this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show .  it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content . 
159 1 i loved the real mc coys (1957-1963) it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not NOT_appear .  she was excellent in the show .  of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martã­nez .  i loved it when he called amos seã±or grampa . i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 2-6 . if only there would be more shows on television like this one ,  everything would be better .  this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared .  god bless all the departed members of the cast and please , llydia reed ,  make yourself known again to the public .  you are loved and respected .  the real mc coys will live forever . 
160 0 i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie .  i found it to be absolutely idiotic .  the mother gets "visions" when she touches certain things or people? and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue .  .  .  just seemed so ridiculous .  deedee pfieffer's performance was awful i thought .  she was very irritating .  the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with . <br /><br />i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not NOT_for NOT_me . 
161 1 i really enjoyed the reunion a lot! i would have rated it a 10 if they had had "hassie" and "little luke" .  there wasn't NOT_even NOT_a NOT_mention NOT_of NOT_where NOT_they NOT_are NOT_today NOT_or NOT_why NOT_they NOT_didn't NOT_participate NOT_in NOT_the NOT_reunion .  they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not NOT_to NOT_give NOT_an NOT_explanation NOT_about NOT_their NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_appearance . <br /><br />anyway ,  i was glad that tnn ran the series again! i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series (i may have missed a few episodes) .  jenny hanahan 
162 0 lifetime did it again .  can we say stupid? i couldn't wait for it to end .  the plot was senseless .  the acting was terrible! especially by the teenagers .  the story has been played a thousand times! are we just desperate to give actors a job? the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thriller . once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie ,  this isn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them .  unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost .  this was a waste of two hours of my life .  can i get them back? i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide .  that would have been more entertaining . 
163 1 i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinez!!!to see them now was wonderful ,  because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited !!!! the only thing i could not NOT_figure NOT_out NOT_is NOT_why NOT_lydia NOT_reed NOT_(hassie NOT_mccoy) NOT_and NOT_michael NOT_winkelman(little NOT_luke) NOT_was NOT_not NOT_on NOT_there . i know that walter brennan had died .  so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed( hassie mccoy) and michael winkelman (little luke i would be thankful!!! i have searched everywere and no NOT_luck NOT_ . the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 .  this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned . the shows today dont have that . the whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do!!! thank you glenda 
164 0 this movie sucked .  it really was a waste of my life .  the acting was atrocious ,  the plot completely implausible .  long ,  long story short ,  these people get "terrorized" by this pathetic "crazed killer" ,  but completely fail to fight back in any manner .  and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip ,  with no NOT_gear ,  and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones .  additionally ,  after their boat goes missing ,  they panic that they're stuck in the woods ,  but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never NOT_consider NOT_that NOT_they NOT_could NOT_just NOT_hike NOT_out NOT_of NOT_the NOT_woods NOT_like NOT_he NOT_did NOT_to NOT_get NOT_to NOT_them .  like i said ,  this movie sucks .  a complete joke .  don't NOT_let NOT_your NOT_girlfriend NOT_talk NOT_you NOT_into NOT_watching NOT_it . 
165 1 fortunately for us real mccoy fans (most likely all baby boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's) ,  three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show ,  in 2000 .  tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter .  as enjoyable as it was to see luke ,  sugar-babe ,  and pepino together again ,  it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman? it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 ,  but i'm not NOT_sure NOT_how .  there is no NOT_information NOT_about NOT_hassie NOT_on NOT_the NOT_internet ,  that i can find .  very curious why they were not NOT_even NOT_mentioned? NOT_it NOT_was NOT_so NOT_conspicuous ,  their absence from the reunion show ,  that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself (if still alive) either ,  1) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted ,  or 2) tnn could not NOT_find NOT_any NOT_trace NOT_of NOT_either NOT_michael NOT_or NOT_lydia NOT_(like NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_us) ,  they seemed to have vanished .  therefore ,  it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together . <br /><br />otherwise ,  the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done .  they made no NOT_bones NOT_about NOT_it NOT_ .  .  .  it was grandpa who made the show such a success .  i remember ,  as a child ,  mimicking grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing (as i'm sure a million other children did back then) .  one annoyance that did bother me a bit ,  was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion  .  .  .  at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point .  in fact ,  although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation ,  he was not NOT_allowed NOT_to NOT_speak-out NOT_and NOT_say NOT_too NOT_much NOT_during NOT_the NOT_reunion NOT_show .  unfortunate ,  since i wanted to hear from all three ,  equally .  all in all ,  the reunion show was a real treat for me .  i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time . <br /><br />dodgerdude 
166 0 jill dunne (played by mitzi kapture) ,  is an attractive ,  nice woman ,  over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter ,  liv (martha macisaac) and a petty ,  two-timing husband ,  sean (rick roberts) ,  both of which were tediously self-centered ,  and obnoxious . <br /><br />this was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm . <br /><br />the storm doesn't NOT_even NOT_happen NOT_until NOT_about NOT_the NOT_last NOT_5 NOT_minutes NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film ,  and then it isn't NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_send NOT_anybody NOT_running NOT_to NOT_the NOT_storm NOT_cellar . <br /><br />the stalking ,  likewise doesn't NOT_get NOT_intense NOT_until NOT_almost NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />most of the film we spend listening to jill and her insufferable daughter ,  liv ,  argue until i just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week . <br /><br />jill's problem with liv is that she has taken up with zack ,  a boy of questionable character ,  and they are constantly making out--in fact jill comes home to find the two of them on liv's bed . <br /><br />the rest of the time we spend listening to jill's husband sean either whine at jill or criticize her . <br /><br />sean was not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_appealing--since NOT_his NOT_face NOT_is NOT_so NOT_covered NOT_in NOT_freckles NOT_you NOT_could NOT_play NOT_connect NOT_the NOT_dots . <br /><br />the story begins with jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never NOT_been NOT_to ,  and that she thought sean had never NOT_been NOT_to NOT_either . <br /><br />jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager ,  richard grant (nick mancuso) ,  a very nice ,  older ,  divorced man ,  who is sympathetic to her .  in fact ,  when he spots her husband there again ,  he phones jill and tips her off . <br /><br />jill returns to the hotel ,  sees sean with another woman .  she is upset ,  leaves without sean seeing her ,  and does absolutely nothing .  in fact ,  she doesn't NOT_even NOT_say NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_sean NOT_when NOT_he NOT_arrives NOT_home .  this made no NOT_sense NOT_to NOT_me . <br /><br />jill has given richard her business card ,  and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate .  she shows him a condo .  afterwards they have a drink ,  and things get cozy between them . <br /><br />richard and jill are getting it on ,  hot and heavy .  in fact ,  he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary ,  when jill suddenly decides to cut out . <br /><br />jill and sean have a confrontation about his cheating .  sean whines about how jill has been letting him down since her father died .  apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault .  eventually jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to sean--and of course that's all her fault too ,  as far as sean is concerned . <br /><br />the little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them ,  especially from the spoiled daughter . <br /><br />i was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody ,  but jill . <br /><br />3 stars 
167 1 a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on "the real mccoys" tv series .  i said then and repeat now it was a charming ,  funny ,  and entertaining show ,  well-acted with wonderful characterizations . <br /><br />i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna ,  kathy nolan ,  and tony martinez .  as another writer here mentioned ,  it is curious that lydia reed (hassie) and michael winkelman (little luke) weren't NOT_refered NOT_to ,  but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra . <br /><br />the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show .  one piece of inside information we did not NOT_get NOT_was NOT_whether NOT_or NOT_not NOT_kathy NOT_nolan NOT_regretted NOT_quitting NOT_the NOT_show NOT_in NOT_an NOT_unpleasant NOT_contract NOT_dispute ,  which left luke a "widow" in it's last year ,  which wasn't NOT_very NOT_good .  nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called "broadside" ,  about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii .  get it? broadside? no ,  not NOT_funny . <br /><br />unlike the sleazy ,  salacious ,  and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values ,  "the real mccoys" entertained with decent values and fine human beings .  and i thank all involved ,  including the creator ,  irving pinkus ,  for having brought it to my family .  we never NOT_missed NOT_it . 
168 0 as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool ,  however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb .  even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not NOT_using NOT_his NOT_light NOT_knife NOT_to NOT_kill NOT_people .  what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it .  what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale .  the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic .  the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon .  the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter ,  flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix .  dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree .  seriously ,  you just have to wonder why this movie was made ,  if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes ,  if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing ,  and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars . 
169 1 i used this film in a religion class i was teaching .  the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment .  a young boy and his mother are away from home .  the boy has been given money to buy milk .  on the way home ,  he stops at carnival to play a game .  next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary .  the boy drops the bottle of milk .  it breaks .  the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk .  this scene alternates with what is happening at home .  a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment .  he(?) discovers the fish bowl and watches it .  the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl .  by now ,  a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish .  the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath .  the cat drops the fish into the bowl .  the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat .  both inspire prejudice .  both are innocent .  it was a great discussion starter in my class . 
170 0 warning: this review contains spoilers .  do not NOT_read NOT_if NOT_you NOT_don't NOT_want NOT_some NOT_points NOT_revealed NOT_to NOT_you NOT_before NOT_you NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />with a cast like this ,  you wonder whether or not NOT_the NOT_actors NOT_and NOT_actresses NOT_knew NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_they NOT_were NOT_getting NOT_into .  did they see the script and say ,  `hey ,  close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one can't NOT_fail . ' unfortunately ,  it does .  did they even think to check on the director's credentials? i mean ,  would you do a movie with the director of a movie called `satan's cheerleaders?' greydon clark ,  who would later go on to direct the infamous `final justice , ' made this .  it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer `final justice' and completely miss out on `the return . '<br /><br />the film is set in a small town in new mexico .  a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam . er . a spaceship appears and hovers over them .  in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film ,  the ship spews some kind of red ink on them .  it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it ,  so right away you are treated with cheese .  anyhow ,  the ship leaves and the adults don't NOT_believe NOT_the NOT_children .  elsewhere ,  we see vincent schiavelli ,  whom i find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `ghost' for proof ,  as they are outstanding) ,  who is playing a prospector ,  or as i called him ,  the miner 1949er .  he steps out of the cave he is in ,  and he and his dog are inked by the ship .  twenty-five years go by ,  and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd ,  who works with her father ,  raymond burr ,  in studying unusual weather phenomena .  or something like that .  shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town ,  and she travels there to research it .  once she gets there ,  the local ranchers harass her ,  and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on ,  and deputy jan-michael vincent comes to her rescue .  from this point on ,  the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other ,  especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier .  while this boring mess is happening ,  vincent schiavelli ,  with his killer dog at his side ,  is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item .  you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at halloween ,  the kind that you shake to make them glow? schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people .  it's the second-worst effect in the movie .  every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick ,  the scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark ,  like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement .  it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is . <br /><br />and what does all this lead up to? it's hard to tell when the final ,  confusing scene arrives .  see ,  burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of `calling card , ' but none of it makes sense .  why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not? schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead ,  but even that doesn't NOT_make NOT_much NOT_sense NOT_when NOT_you NOT_really NOT_think NOT_about NOT_it .  i mean ,  why doesn't NOT_he NOT_kill NOT_jan-michael NOT_vincent? NOT_after NOT_all ,  he had twenty-five years to do it .  and the aliens won't NOT_need NOT_him NOT_if NOT_shepherd NOT_is NOT_dead NOT_anyhow ,  so why try to kill her? speaking of the aliens ,  it is never NOT_clear NOT_what NOT_they NOT_really NOT_wanted NOT_out NOT_of NOT_shepherd NOT_and NOT_vincent .  what is their goal? why do they wait so long to intervene? how could they be so sure shepherd would come back? not NOT_that NOT_the NOT_answer NOT_to NOT_any NOT_of NOT_these NOT_and NOT_other NOT_questions NOT_would NOT_have NOT_made NOT_`the NOT_return' NOT_any NOT_more NOT_pleasant .  you would still have bad lines ,  really bad acting ,  particularly by shepherd ,  cheesy effects ,  and poor direction .  luckily ,  the stars escaped from this movie .  cybill shepherd soon went on to star in `moonlighting' with bruce willis .  jan-michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b-movies ,  often in over-the-top parts .  raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death .  vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films .  martin landau ,  who played a kooky law enforcement officer ,  quickly made the terrific `alone in the dark' and the awful `the being' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently .  you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to `the return . ' zantara's score: 2 out of 10 . 
171 1 i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 ,  when it was shown in combination with the red balloon .  both films are similar in their dream-like quality .  the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner ,  a little boy ,  is away at school .  a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are ,  and begins to warily stalk his "prey . " the boy begins his walk home from school ,  and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend .  the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence ,  and finally jumps out of the bowl! the cat quickly walks over to the fish ,  gently picks him up with his paws ,  and returns him to his bowl .  the boy returns happily to his fish ,  none the wiser . <br /><br />the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity .  it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003 . <br /><br />if you can find it ,  watch it -- you won't NOT_be NOT_disappointed! NOT_and NOT_if NOT_you NOT_*do* NOT_find NOT_it ,  let me know so i can get a copy ,  too! 
172 0 as a southern baptist ,  it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie .  there certainly aren't NOT_so NOT_many NOT_that NOT_i NOT_want NOT_to NOT_discourage NOT_film-makers NOT_from NOT_a NOT_genre NOT_that's NOT_woefully NOT_under-exploited .  still ,  i must honestly say that "love's abiding joy" is a typically low budget ,  low key ,  self-consciously christian film .  the plot is predictable ,  the acting mediocre (i'm being kind) ,  and the editing atrocious .  as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average ,  but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired .  keep trying guys .  you've got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere .  might i suggest you turn to g .  k .  chesterton or c .  s .  lewis for some inspiration? 
173 1 i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater (where i used to attend "kiddie matinã©e"s almost every saturday) in dayton ,  ohio when i was a young boy and have never NOT_forgotten NOT_it .  it simply amazed me and my friends .  i do wish there were some way i could see it again! i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no NOT_avail .  i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more .  how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding .  the fish is actually in the cat's mouth at one point ,  if i remember correctly! if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful! 
174 0 i have read all of the love come softly books .  knowing full well that movies can not NOT_use NOT_all NOT_aspects NOT_of NOT_the NOT_book , but generally they at least have the main point of the book .  i was highly disappointed in this movie .  the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy's father comes to visit , (although in the book both parents come) .  that is all .  the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes ,  sad ,  from the book ,  that i just couldn't enjoy it .  even if i didn't NOT_read NOT_the NOT_book NOT_it NOT_was NOT_too NOT_sad .  i do know that pioneer life was rough , but the whole movie was a downer .  the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great . 
175 1 this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre .  told completely without dialogue ,  it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish ,  lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school ,  leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open .  after a while ,  a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around ,  comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl .  the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited .  as the cat comes very near to the bowl ,  the fish jumps out .  the cat catches the fish ,  drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy ,  not NOT_knowing NOT_what NOT_has NOT_happened ,  gets back .  this was amazingly filmed with real animals; how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable .  i only wish this film were available now for people to see; i only saw it once ,  in 1959 when it was originally released ,  but it has remained unforgettable . 
176 0 i very much looked forward to this movie .  its a good family movie; however ,  if michael landon jr . 's editing team did a better job of editing ,  the movie would be much better .  too many scenes out of context .  i do hope there is another movie from the series ,  they're all very good .  but ,  if another one is made ,  i beg them to take better care at editing .  this story was all over the place and didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_have NOT_a NOT_center .  which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great .  i enjoy the story of willie and missy; they're both great role models .  plus ,  the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story . 
177 1 this was one of the best movies i have seen .  the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part .  although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget ,  i found it to be exhilarating to watch . <br /><br />some may not NOT_like NOT_the NOT_story NOT_and NOT_say NOT_the NOT_script NOT_is NOT_lacking NOT_direction .  however ,  when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters ,  there is no NOT_direction NOT_is NOT_life .  i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations . <br /><br />most of the cast are newcomers to the industry .  however ,  they all pulled it off very well .  everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately . <br /><br />i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control .  this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways . 
178 0 i've seen all four of the movies in this series .  each one strays further and further from the books .  this is the worst one yet .  my problem is that it does not NOT_follow NOT_the NOT_book NOT_it NOT_is NOT_titled NOT_after NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way! NOT_the NOT_directors NOT_and NOT_producers NOT_should NOT_have NOT_named NOT_it NOT_any NOT_thing NOT_other NOT_than NOT_"love's NOT_abiding NOT_joy . " the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (willie ,  missie ,  henry ,  clark ,  scottie and cookie) .  the names/ages/genders of the children are wrong .  the entire story line is no NOT_where NOT_in NOT_the NOT_book . <br /><br />i find it a great disservice to janette oke ,  her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not NOT_correct NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way .  the music is too loud .  the actors are not NOT_convincing NOT_- NOT_they NOT_lack NOT_emotions . <br /><br />if you want a good family movie ,  this might do .  it is clean .  don't NOT_watch NOT_it ,  though ,  if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book .  i hope that this will be the last movie from this series ,  but i doubt it .  if there are more movies made ,  i wish michael landon ,  jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines .  the books are excellent and ,  if closely followed ,  would make excellent movies! 
179 1 to be honest ,  i had no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_about NOT_when NOT_i NOT_started NOT_it .  that's how i watch movies whenever possible .  no NOT_preconception .  i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something .  i was wrong ,  kinda . <br /><br />loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me .  i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_do . <br /><br />another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ .  these kinds of things do happen .  i'm sorry but not NOT_everyone NOT_lives NOT_in NOT_a NOT_dream NOT_world NOT_where NOT_nothing NOT_bad NOT_can NOT_happen NOT_and NOT_crazy NOT_situations NOT_are NOT_"implausible" .  really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen .  the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices .  sometimes things turn out good ,  sometimes they turn out bad and such is life . <br /><br />i highly recommend this movie . 
180 0 :spoilers:<br /><br />i was very disappointed in love's abiding joy .  i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re-aired thursday night on hallmark .  i love the first three "love" movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be .  the whole movie was sad and depressing ,  there were way to many goofs ,  and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context .  i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_fit .  it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion .  there seemed to be no NOT_interaction NOT_between NOT_missie NOT_and NOT_willie NOT_at NOT_all . <br /><br />i think the script writers should have went more by the book .  it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke's writings .  i mean in the movie they never NOT_mentioned NOT_a NOT_thing NOT_about NOT_the NOT_mine NOT_and NOT_the NOT_two NOT_boys NOT_or NOT_clark NOT_getting NOT_hurt NOT_because NOT_of NOT_it .  and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard . <br /><br />out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that love's abiding joy is my least favorite .  i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't NOT_so NOT_bland .  i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next . 
181 1 yeah ,  the poster is quite a horrible piece of work . <br /><br />i thought the movie was ok .  .  . nothing really outstanding .  .  . i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life . <br /><br />ahh ,  but that can't NOT_happen NOT_to NOT_rich NOT_kids NOT_now NOT_can NOT_it? NOT_not NOT_to NOT_the NOT_son NOT_of NOT_a NOT_wealthy NOT_businessman NOT_who NOT_holds NOT_big NOT_ballroom NOT_parties NOT_and NOT_has NOT_a NOT_nice NOT_manicured NOT_lawn NOT_on NOT_the NOT_front NOT_of NOT_the NOT_mini NOT_mansion . <br /><br />no .  .  . the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed .  after all ,  who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school? <br /><br />ah ,  the poor little rich kids .  .  . in their quaint pretty house ,  with their ivy league schools ,  ultra clean homes and socialite parties .  .  . what will the world do without them? <br /><br />i hope they all get addicted to drugs ,  pass-away their life and end up in jail .  .  . so maybe we can see movies that don't NOT_all NOT_revolve NOT_around NOT_the NOT_poor NOT_little NOT_rich NOT_boys NOT_and NOT_girls NOT_of NOT_the NOT_surreal NOT_world . 
182 0 i rented this movie about 3 years ago ,  and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made .  i don't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_ever NOT_finished NOT_it .  it is worse than a home video made by a high school student .  i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt ,  oakley sunglasses and a newer suv ,  like a toyota rav-4 or something (i don't NOT_remember) .  i don't NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_they NOT_could NOT_have NOT_possibly NOT_said NOT_that NOT_to NOT_be NOT_in NOT_the NOT_70s .  he might have had a cell phone too ,  i cant remember ,  it was just horrible .  i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back .  to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen ,  and i have seen some pretty bad ones . 
183 1 generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't NOT_stray NOT_from NOT_their NOT_persons .  i especially liked the plot ,  although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie .  however ,  i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell .  for instance- what happened to tristan's brother ,  hayden? for all we know he died in the hospital .  maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! who knows! maybe there will be a sequel? maybe? if there is .  .  i cant wait to see it . 
184 0 really ,  i can't NOT_believe NOT_that NOT_i NOT_spent NOT_$5 NOT_on NOT_this NOT_movie .  i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad .  it had zombies in it right? was i wrong! to be honest the movie had it's moments .  .  . i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it .  overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again .  the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that .  buyer beware .  .  . unless you are into masochism . 
185 1 this is no NOT_art-house NOT_film ,  it's mainstream entertainment .  <br /><br />lot's of beautiful people ,  t&a ,  and action .  i found it very entertaining .  it's not NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_intellectually NOT_stimulating ,  it's a fun film to watch! jesse and chace are funny too ,  which is just gravy .  definitely worth a rental . <br /><br />so in summary ,  i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)<br /><br />the villains are good too .  vinnie ,  corey large ,  the hatian guy from heroes .  very nasty villains . 
186 0 a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town ,  and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo ,  both zombie related .  but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too .  .  . <br /><br />the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen .  in fact i must confess ,  so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage .  and there was a lot of that ,  believe me .  it runs for just 69 minutes ,  and there is still tons of filler .  you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups ,  plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed ,  tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never NOT_become NOT_actors . <br /><br />as for the title characters ,  they barely even have a footnote in the film .  why ,  you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! though ,  considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights') ,  maybe that's a blessing in disguise . <br /><br />and to top it all off ,  it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on youtube .  jerky camera-work ,  scratches on the print ,  flickering lights .  .  .  i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 ,  and not NOT_1971 .  even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />if you think i'm not NOT_qualified NOT_to NOT_do NOT_a NOT_review NOT_of NOT_chronicles NOT_having NOT_not NOT_seen NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_film ,  then go ahead .  you try sitting through it ,  i betcha you won't NOT_even NOT_make NOT_it NOT_to NOT_the NOT_first NOT_appearance NOT_of NOT_the NOT_blue-smartie NOT_coloured NOT_freaks NOT_before NOT_making NOT_your NOT_excuses NOT_and NOT_leaving .  it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it ,  and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror .  in fact ,  don't NOT_for NOT_surprised NOT_if NOT_it NOT_packs NOT_it's NOT_bags NOT_and NOT_leaves NOT_in NOT_the NOT_morning ,  leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life .  you have been warned .  .  .  0/10<br /><br />p . s what kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! see ,  the movie can't NOT_even NOT_get NOT_that NOT_part NOT_right .  .  . 
187 1 my first child was born the year this program came out ,  and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter .  when the cd came out ,  i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families .  .  . it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album .  i recently found several dvd's (made on dvd-r from video tapes ,  probably) for sale on ebay .  the one i bought was an excellent copy ,  and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years .  there are some songs on the show that were not NOT_on NOT_the NOT_album ,  and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show .  but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever . 
188 0 the zombie chronicles <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1 . 33:1 (nu-view 3-d)<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere ,  a young reporter (emmy smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (joseph haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area . <br /><br />an absolute waste of time ,  hobbled from the outset by haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role .  worse still ,  the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine ,  made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by brad sykes ,  previously responsible for the likes of camp blood (1999) .  this isn't NOT_a NOT_'fun' NOT_movie NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sense NOT_that NOT_ed NOT_wood's NOT_movies NOT_are NOT_'fun' NOT_(he ,  at least ,  believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts ,  despite a lack of talent); sykes' home-made movies are ,  in fact ,  aggravating ,  boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue ,  and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative ,  badly-conceived junk .  the 3-d format is utterly wasted here . 
189 1 i am a huge john denver fan .  i have a large collection of his music on vinyl .  i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it .  i have the original vinyl album and cd .  i have the original cd and later release .  the later release is missing several songs though .  i see that it has been released this year with all original songs .  to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at $75 . 00 .  wow - to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much .  to me no NOT_amount NOT_is NOT_worth NOT_selling NOT_this NOT_treasure .  it is my favorite christmas cd .  i have never NOT_been NOT_able NOT_to NOT_find NOT_it NOT_on NOT_vhs NOT_or NOT_dvd .  i would love to have either version .  if anyone has one available please let me know .  thanks 
190 0 you have to admire brad sykes even if you don't NOT_particularly NOT_want NOT_to ,  a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions .  but keeps on doing it all the same .  even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and i'm as guilty of this as anyone .  brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix ,  a neat idea ,  a kooky character ,  whatever ,  but without the funds to take it further than base level ,  he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be .  joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film .  coming to a multiplex near you ,  in a parallel universe ,  somewhere . 
191 1 yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222@verizon . net . i searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not NOT_to NOT_sure NOT_but NOT_its NOT_close . 
192 0  .  . oh wait ,  i can! this movie is not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_typical NOT_film NOT_snob ,  unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions ,  like "continuity editing" and "geographic match" .  i couldn't tell where i was in this movie .  one second they're in the present ,  next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing .  i think .  i couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible .  i think it only got attention because it has a 3d which i did not NOT_watch .  if you're a b-movie buff ,  and by b-movie i mean bad movie ,  then this film is for you .  it's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake .  if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni ,  though ,  just skip this one . 
193 1 i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver & the muppets a christmas together . this made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy .  i was disappointed not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_find NOT_it NOT_yet NOT_on NOT_dvd .  the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show .  i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show .  the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading ,  the sound is not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_the NOT_cd .  there is also a few other songs not NOT_put NOT_on NOT_the NOT_cd .  as a fan of john denver and of the muppets ,  a dvd of this show would really be a good seller .  if you don't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_cd NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_wonderful NOT_chritmas NOT_collection NOT_of NOT_songs NOT_taken NOT_from NOT_that NOT_show .  the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on . 
194 0 i have not NOT_seen NOT_many NOT_low NOT_budget NOT_films NOT_i NOT_must NOT_admit ,  but this is the worst movie ever probably ,  the main character the old man talked like ,  he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds ,  a 5 year old could act better .  the story had the most awful plot ,  and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top ,  i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was ,  and hoped it was leading onto the real movie .  i cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters ,  instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight .  i think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman ,  i think the only thing ok with the budget was the make up ,  but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit .  awful simply awful . 
195 1 this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd  ,  since my 33 rpm got lost , and any cassettes i made are also long gone . <br /><br />i am not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_big NOT_john NOT_denver NOT_fan NOT_but NOT_was NOT_very NOT_impressed NOT_with NOT_the NOT_music NOT_ ,  which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin ( esp little st .  nick ! ) it also contained a few little known songs ( original ? ) . <br /><br />even though it was done at the end of the '70's this show had a timeless feel to it .  hoping to find a copy soon !!! 
196 0 i received this movie as a gift ,  i knew from the dvd cover ,  this movie are going to be bad . after not NOT_watching NOT_it NOT_for NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_year NOT_i NOT_finally NOT_watched NOT_it .  what a pathetic movieâ… . <br /><br />i almost didn't NOT_finish NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_bad NOT_movie , but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie . <br /><br />trust me when i say " this movie sucks" i am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie ,  but it couldn't have cost more than $20 000 to produce this movie .  all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera  . about 15 people with no NOT_acting NOT_skills ,  a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people . <br /><br />in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter (tara woodley )run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town .  he are completely unharmed .  they went to a supposed to be abandon house  , but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there .  just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not NOT_what NOT_it NOT_seems . <br /><br />then the supposed drunk man start telling tara ghost/zombies stories . <br /><br />the fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history . <br /><br />his story<br /><br />sgt .  ben draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion (i think this is what happens)after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse  , ben draper<br /><br />buries him in a shallow grave . <br /><br />but sgt .  ben draper are in for n big surprise .  his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt .  ben draper to take revenge on private wilson . (next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered) the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf . <br /><br />the twist ending were so lame . <br /><br />even if you like b horror movies ,  don't NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie 
197 1 for me too ,  this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly .  in 1989 ,  i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording ,  giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself .  it's part of my family's christmas tradition now ,  and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen . <br /><br />it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show ,  and they did more than one special together .  the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here ,  in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages . 
198 0 some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great ,  but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others ,  the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles . <br /><br />the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh .  other than that ,  its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk . <br /><br />it's been noted elsewhere ,  but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence ,  so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks ,  you've seen it all already . <br /><br />bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 , 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker ,  who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit) ,  and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip . <br /><br />awful ,  awful stuff .  we've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera ,  but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere .  avoid . 
199 1 a christmas together actually came before my time ,  but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music .  for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas .  a few years ago ,  i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay ,  so after listening to all the music for some 21 years ,  i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself .  if you ever get the chance ,  it's a lot of fun--great music ,  heart-warming and cheesy .  it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today .  i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--i guess normally performers don't NOT_compromise NOT_their NOT_images NOT_by NOT_doing NOT_sing-a-longs NOT_with NOT_the NOT_muppets ,  but i'm glad he did .  even if you can't NOT_track NOT_down NOT_the NOT_video ,  the soundtrack is worth it too .  it has some muppified traditional favorites ,  but also some original denver tunes as well .

201 1 scott bartlett's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness .  it is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic ,  pulsating ,  epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours ,  and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema .  there's no NOT_story NOT_to NOT_speak NOT_of ,  but bartlett uses images of nature â– particularly the human face and form â– to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions ,  integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology .  in a sense ,  the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools ,  his machinery ,  his technology .  this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick's '2001: a space odyssey (1968) , ' and ,  indeed ,  bartlett's opening sequence of images â– flashing colours before a close-up human eye â– recalls dave bowman's journey through the stargate .  the visuals are richly-coloured ,  a confronting blend of sharp ,  vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video ,  as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact ,  the end product was recorded from a tv monitor} . <br /><br />there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date .  imdb lists the film as a 1972 release ,  but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year .  perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening .  either way ,  the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time ,  occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video ,  and some brisk techno music wouldn't NOT_have NOT_gone NOT_amiss ,  either! 'offon' captures grainy ,  fragmented images ,  presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information .  i had a thought â– and please don't NOT_laugh NOT_at NOT_this NOT_free-thinking NOT_interpretation NOT_â– NOT_that NOT_an NOT_extraterrestrial NOT_civilisation NOT_capturing NOT_earth's NOT_television NOT_signals NOT_might NOT_very NOT_well NOT_receive NOT_such NOT_a NOT_disjointed ,  alien documentation of human life ,  a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense .  perhaps this is where mankind ,  with all his technology ,  is eventually heading ,  towards an irreversible merging of film and video ,  of purity and artificiality .

203 1 imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason ,  but the other sources i've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68 .  doesn't NOT_really NOT_matter ,  except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first art works to merge the two apparently) in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 ,  released the same year .  pure abstraction isn't NOT_really NOT_my NOT_thing ,  but i can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers ,  rohrschach blots ,  birds ,  etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful .  certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s ,  and deserves to be better known . 
204 0 my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke .  little did we realize the joke was on her for paying â£1 for it .  while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles .  these included:<br /><br />1) drinking bleach 2) rubbing sand in my eyes 3) writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy 4) re-enacting the american civil war 5) tax returns 6) gcse maths 7) sex with an old lady . <br /><br />garrett clancy ,  aka sgt .  ben draper wrote this? the guy couldn't even dig a hole properly .  the best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film) .  this was the worst film i have ever seen ,  and i've seen white noise: the light .  never NOT_has NOT_a NOT_film NOT_had NOT_so NOT_many NOT_mistakes NOT_in NOT_it .  my girlfriend left it here ,  so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap . <br /><br />news just in: owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself .  fact . <br /><br />do not NOT_watch 
205 1 i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school(!) ,  it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day ,  and under the entry for movies (or cinema ,  i don't NOT_remember) ,  were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental ,  and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon .  it really intrigued me ,  since it stood out the most on the page (it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it) . <br /><br />about 18 or so years later ,  the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4-dvd set of "treasures of american film archives" released by the national film preservation foundation .  so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set ,  i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs .  after all these years ,  i could finally see the film! after viewing it ,  it slightly wasn't NOT_was NOT_i NOT_was NOT_expecting NOT_it NOT_to NOT_be NOT_(it NOT_tended NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_more NOT_organic-looking NOT_film ,  not NOT_that NOT_that's NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_thing ,  but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic) ,  but it was still an impressive film ,  imho ,  considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film ,  including hand-tinting the film itself ,  and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor) ,  giving it a more distressed ,  lo-res look . <br /><br />don't get me wrong ,  the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972 .  that's why it's still one of my favorite short/experimental films ,  and a creative inspiration for me as well .  .  . 
206 0 without wishing to be a killjoy ,  brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichã©d films i've ever seen - this being one of them ,  and camp blood being another .  <br /><br />the acting is terrible ,  the print is shoddy ,  and everything about this film screams "seriously ,  you could do better yourself" .  maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />i bought this for â£1 ,  but remember ,  you can't NOT_put NOT_a NOT_price NOT_on NOT_71 NOT_minutes NOT_of NOT_your NOT_life .  you'd do well to avoid this turkey ,  even at a bargain basement price . 
207 1 when i read other comment , i decided to watch this movie .  .  . <br /><br />first ,  cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli; good enough .  .  . <br /><br />film , very intelligence and interesting because  , cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia .  .  . <br /><br />second , story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion .  .  . <br /><br />third , final chapter is not NOT_special NOT_or NOT_interesting , it's regular like other action movies .  .  . <br /><br />finally , i recommend to watch this movie .  .  . and i hope you'll love it enjoy :d 
208 0 en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway) ,  a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination .  the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story ,  an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband ,  but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story ,  a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on . <br /><br />the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologyâ—a nice idea ,  but with only two stories ,  it falls woefully short .  and that's not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_way NOT_in NOT_which NOT_this NOT_low NOT_budget NOT_gore NOT_flick NOT_fails NOT_to NOT_deliver: NOT_the NOT_acting NOT_is NOT_lousy NOT_(with NOT_joe NOT_haggerty ,  as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson ,  giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending .  .  .  .  well ,  that beggars belief . <br /><br />to be fair ,  some of sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off ,  eyeballs are plucked out ,  a face is removed ,  brains are squished ,  and there is a messy decapitation .  these positives just about make the film bearable ,  but be warned ,  the zombie chronicles ain't NOT_a NOT_stroll NOT_in NOT_the NOT_park ,  even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash . <br /><br />i give the zombie chronicles 2/10 ,  but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn't NOT_get NOT_to NOT_view NOT_the NOT_film NOT_with NOT_the NOT_benefit NOT_of NOT_3d NOT_(although NOT_i NOT_have NOT_a NOT_sneaking NOT_suspicion NOT_that NOT_an NOT_extra NOT_dimension NOT_wouldn't NOT_have NOT_made NOT_that NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_difference) .

210 0 there's tons of good-looking women in this flick .  but alas ,  this movie is nudity-free .  grrrrrrrrrr strike one . <br /><br />ahem .  one story in this film takes place in 1971 .  then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage? hello? continuity ,  anyone?<br /><br />as you might know ,  this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d .  and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen .  i'm not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_someone NOT_botched NOT_the NOT_job NOT_on NOT_this ,  but there was no NOT_3d ,  just double-vision blurs .  i didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_same NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_this NOT_company's NOT_other NOT_3d NOT_movies ,  hunting season and camp blood .  sure ,  the 3d in those ones sucked too ,  but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect . <br /><br />this thing is a big ball of nothing . <br /><br />and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame ,  yum! i'd like to see more of her .  in movies ,  as well .  looks like janet margolin at a young age .  purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br /> 
211 1 gotta start with ed furlong on this one .  you gotta .  god bless this kid .  $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life .  he has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script .  you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't NOT_even NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_furlong NOT_is NOT_even NOT_acting .  maybe that's why his performance was good .  same with madsen .  you keep thinking ,  "i bet this guy is really like this in real life . " does madsen even have to act? just natural .  vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted mummy guy .  i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance .  her reactions are spot-on in this film .  i battled if she was hot or not ,  but realized i would just like to see more of her .  <br /><br />not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films .  but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing .  it's not NOT_just NOT_your NOT_standard NOT_robbers NOT_take NOT_over NOT_a NOT_bank ,  they kill hostages ,  and the good guys win in the end type of film .  the twists keep on coming .  .  . and coming . <br /><br />the cafã© scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there .  not NOT_glossed NOT_over NOT_a NOT_bit .  think like bourne ultimatum "lite" style on some scenes in the cafã© . <br /><br />and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne (who plays karl) will make you do a double take .  these guys are twins . <br /><br />as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town .  made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents .  but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not NOT_have NOT_heard NOT_of .  and some of them are smoking hot .  moncia dean? need i say more . 
212 0 1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(dir-brad sykes): mindless 3-d movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle .  and yes ,  we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d!! wow ,  not!! that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not NOT_the NOT_actual NOT_flesh-eating .  that's what made the original zombie classics good .  the flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra .  we're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's .  the last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well .  well ,  i think i've said enough .  watch the classics ,  not NOT_this NOT_3d NOT_bore-feast . 
213 1 the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves .  sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa .  europa tells a story of a young german-american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war .  he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train .  because of his job ,  he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany ,  meeting with the killing of traitors ,  and hunt for former nazi party members .  the society is suffering from corruption .  his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train .  by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains .  the atmosphere is astounding .  the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene .  just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!! 
214 0 if the crew behind "zombie chronicles" ever read this ,  here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1 .  in a "twist ending"-type movie ,  it's not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_idea NOT_to NOT_insert NOT_close-ups NOT_of NOT_every NOT_death NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_in NOT_the NOT_opening NOT_credits .  that tends to spoil the twists ,  y'know .  .  . ? <br /><br />2 .  i know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please ,  hire people who can actually act .  or at least ,  walk ,  talk and gesture at the same time .  joe haggerty ,  i'm looking at you .  .  . <br /><br />3 .  if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past ,  only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time . <br /><br />4 .  twist endings are supposed to be a surprise .  sure ,  we don't NOT_want NOT_twists NOT_that NOT_make NOT_no NOT_sense ,  but signposting the "reveal" as soon as you introduce a character? that's not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_idea . <br /><br />kudos to the guys for trying ,  but in all honesty ,  i'd rather they hadn't .  .  . <br /><br />only for zombie completists . 
215 1 lars von triers europa is an extremely good film .  how's that? von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story ,  at least he did have with europa .  to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen .  even with all the tricks ,  in my opinion ,  this film is the most complete ,  real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list .  i also think it is perhaps the scariest ,  the most gothic and complete film around .  all right there are other good ones too ,  but this one is my favorite .  the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever . 
216 0 pros: nothing<br /><br />cons: everything<br /><br />plot summary: a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies . <br /><br />review: never NOT_in NOT_my NOT_life NOT_have NOT_i NOT_come NOT_across NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_the NOT_zombie NOT_chronicles .  filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks ,  tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame ,  forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening .  how does a movie like this even get made? simply put ,  avoid tzc like a sexually-transmitted disease . <br /><br />my last 2 cents: humorously enough ,  this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films .  they're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this . <br /><br />my rating: 1 out of 10(if it were up to me ,  this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion) 
217 1 `europa' (or ,  as it is also known ,  `zentropa') is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen .  the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless .  .  .  a true feast for the eyes .  the picture was a contender for a 1991's golden palm in canners .  the award went to barton fink (by coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to zentropa .  here's an exercise in class: rent both films and be a judge for yourself . 
218 0 i think i will make a movie next weekend .  oh wait ,  i'm working .  . oh i'm sure i can fit it in .  it looks like whoever made this film fit it in .  i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! it looks like someones home movie and i don't NOT_think NOT_more NOT_than NOT_$100 NOT_was NOT_spent NOT_making NOT_it!!! NOT_total NOT_crap!!! NOT_who NOT_let's NOT_this NOT_stuff NOT_be NOT_released?!?!?! 
219 1 this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art ,  not NOT_an NOT_entertainment NOT_business .  lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating .  you get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits .  the plot necessarily comes second ,  but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised .  just wonderful . 
220 0 i have this film out of the library right now and i haven't finished watching it .  it is so bad i am in disbelief .  audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then ,  although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'robin and marian . ' this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film .  it's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide . <br /><br />there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies .  little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest ,  palest shadow . <br /><br />who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'breakfast at tiffany's' twenty years earlier? the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_for NOT_the NOT_credits NOT_to NOT_find NOT_out NOT_that NOT_something NOT_was NOT_subtly NOT_woven NOT_into NOT_the NOT_cine-musique NOT_of NOT_the NOT_picture NOT_to NOT_know NOT_when NOT_the NOT_songs NOT_blasted NOT_out NOT_at NOT_you . <br /><br />'reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down ,  i guess .  in this case ,  audrey hepburn's chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star .  here she has even lost her talent as a star .  if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period ,  like ann-margret ,  had played the role ,  there would have been some life in it ,  even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid-level situations . <br /><br />hepburn was a great person ,  of course ,  greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being ,  and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors .  after this dreadful performance ,  she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called 'love among thieves . ' in 'they all laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's .  even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn .  turner took acting seriously even when she was bad .  hepburn doesn't NOT_take NOT_it NOT_seriously NOT_at NOT_all ,  couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky .  her last really good work was in 'two for the road , ' perhaps her most perfect ,  if possibly not NOT_her NOT_best NOT_in NOT_many NOT_ways . <br /><br />and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening .  john ritter is horrible ,  there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten ,  who was truly pretty .  otherwise ,  critic david thomson's oft-used phrase 'losing his/her talent' never NOT_has NOT_made NOT_more NOT_sense . <br /><br />ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then ,  and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn--who could ask for anything less? sandra dee's last ,  pitiful film 'lost , ' from 2 years later ,  a low-budget nothing ,  had more to it than this .  at least ms .  dee spoke in her own voice; by 1981 ,  audrey hepburn's accent just sounded silly; she'd go on to do the pbs 'gardens of the world with audrey hepburn' and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about 'what i like most is when flowers go back to nature!' as in naturalized daffodils ,  but in an actual fictional movie ,  she just sounds ridiculous . <br /><br />to think that 'breakfast at tiffany's' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world--she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in 'my fair lady' ,  matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in 'last year at marienbad . ' and then this! and her final brief role as the angel 'hap' in the spielberg film 'always' was just more of the lady stuff--corny ,  witless and stifling . <br /><br />i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church ,  a beautiful service which included a boys' choir singing the shaker hymn 'simple gifts . ' the only thing not NOT_listed NOT_in NOT_the NOT_program NOT_was NOT_the NOT_sudden NOT_playing NOT_of NOT_hepburn's NOT_singing NOT_'moon NOT_river' NOT_on NOT_the NOT_fire NOT_escape NOT_in NOT_'breakfast NOT_at NOT_tiffany's , ' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation . <br /><br />a great lady who was once a fine actress (as in 'the nun's story') and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's who became a truly bad one--that's not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_common .  and perhaps it is only a great human being who ,  in making such things as film performances trivial ,  nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly--which all of her late film work contained in abundance .  most of the talk about hepburn's miscasting is about 'my fair lady . ' but the one that should have had the original actress in it was 'wait until dark , ' which had starred lee remick on broadway .  never NOT_as NOT_celebrated NOT_as NOT_hepburn ,  she was a better actress in many ways (hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid) ,  although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part .  after that ,  all of her acting went downhill . 
221 1 this is the definite lars von trier movie ,  my favorite ,  i rank it higher than "breaking the waves" or the latest "dancer in the dark" .  .  .  i simply love the beauty of the picture .  .  . the framing is so original; acting is wonderful ,  a must see . 
222 0 my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video .  although it had great actors/actresses ,  there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest .  plus it just wasn't NOT_that NOT_interesting .  dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable .  i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn's last movies .  i'll always love john ritter best in slapstick .  he was just too pathetic here . 
223 1 before dogma 95: when lars used movies as art ,  not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_story .  a beautiful painting about love and death .  this is one of my favorite movies of all time .  the color .  .  .  the music .  .  .  just perfect . 
224 0 this film is just plain horrible .  john ritter doing pratt falls ,  75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards ,  poor editing ,  horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise) ,  and a plot that really goes nowhere .  i didn't NOT_think NOT_i'd NOT_ever NOT_say NOT_this ,  but dorothy stratten is not NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_actress NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  there are at least 3 others that suck more .  patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein .  i started to wonder if she wasn't NOT_dead NOT_inside .  even bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card) .  this movie is seriously horrible .  there's a reason bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later .  please don't NOT_watch NOT_it .  if you see it in your television listings ,  cancel your cable .  if a friend suggests it to you ,  reconsider your friendship .  if your spouse wants to watch it ,  you're better off finding another soulmate .  i'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again .  if i could sum this film up in one word ,  that word would be: suckotrocity 
225 1 europa (zentropa) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago .  this film is truly unique ,  and a work of genius .  the camerawork and the editing are brilliant ,  and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film ,  creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience . <br /><br />the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed .  max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator . <br /><br />a one of a kind movie! four stars (highest rating) . 
226 0 today i found "they all laughed" on vhs on sale in a rental .  it was a really old and very used vhs ,  i had no NOT_information NOT_about NOT_this NOT_movie ,  but i liked the references listed on its cover: the names of peter bogdanovich ,  audrey hepburn ,  john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me ,  the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it .  i searched imdb ,  and the user rating of 6 . 0 was an excellent reference .  i looked in "mick martin & marsha porter video & dvd guide 2003" and â– wow â– four stars! so ,  i decided that i could not NOT_waste NOT_more NOT_time NOT_and NOT_immediately NOT_see NOT_it .  indeed ,  i have just finished watching "they all laughed" and i found it a very boring overrated movie .  the characters are badly developed ,  and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story .  the plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing) ,  but i have not NOT_laughed NOT_along NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_story .  the coincidences ,  in a huge city like new york ,  are ridiculous .  ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man ,  with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt ,  antonio banderas or george clooney ,  is quite ridiculous .  in the end ,  the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten ,  murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie ,  and whose life was showed in "star 80" and "death of a centerfold: the dorothy stratten story"; the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen ,  the future mrs .  keith richards; the always wonderful ,  even being fifty-two years old ,  audrey hepburn; and the song "amigo" ,  from roberto carlos .  although i do not NOT_like NOT_him ,  roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as "the king" .  i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly dorothy stratten) .  my vote is four . <br /><br />title (brazil): "muito riso e muita alegria" ("many laughs and lots of happiness") 
227 1 i haven't seen this movie in about 5 years ,  but it still haunts me .  <br /><br />when asked about my favorite films ,  this is the one that i seem to always mention first .  there are certain films (works of art like this film ,  "dark city" ,  and "breaking the waves") that seem to touch a place within you ,  a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive ,  that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer ,  not NOT_unlike NOT_a NOT_life-changing NOT_event ,  such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend .  .  .  this film "shook" me when i first saw it .  it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days . 
228 0 its not NOT_the NOT_cast .  a finer group of actors ,  you could not NOT_find .  its not NOT_the NOT_setting .  the director is in love with new york city ,  and by the end of the film ,  so are we all! woody allen could not NOT_improve NOT_upon NOT_what NOT_bogdonovich NOT_has NOT_done NOT_here .  if you are going to fall in love ,  or find love ,  manhattan is the place to go .  no ,  the problem with the movie is the script .  there is none .  the actors fall in love at first sight ,  words are unnecessary .  in the director's own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set .  it is reality to him ,  and his peers ,  but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world .  so ,  in the end ,  the movie is hollow ,  and shallow ,  and message-less . 
229 1 as much as the movie was good ,  i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already .  all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark .  maybe i wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me . 
230 0 never NOT_cast NOT_models NOT_and NOT_playboy NOT_bunnies NOT_in NOT_your NOT_films! NOT_bob NOT_fosse's NOT_"star NOT_80" NOT_about NOT_dorothy NOT_stratten ,  of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband ,  is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen .  patty hansen is no NOT_actress NOT_either .  . i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful "poodlesque" hair-do .  .  .  . very disappointing .  .  .  . "paper moon" and "the last picture show" i could watch again and again .  this clunker i could barely sit through once .  this movie was reputedly not NOT_released NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_brouhaha NOT_surrounding NOT_ms .  stratten's tawdry death; i think the real reason was because it was so bad! 
231 1 piece of subtle art .  maybe a masterpiece .  doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence .  tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world .  the life is ,  in this film ,  only exercise of adaptation .  lesson about limits and original sin ,  about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways . <br /><br />leopold kessle is another joseph k .  images of trial and same ambiguous woman .  and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age . <br /><br />methaphor or parable ,  the movie is history of disappointed's evolution .  war ,  peace ,  business or lie are only details of gelatin-time .  hypocrisy is a mask .  love- a convention .  the sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality . 
232 0 i can't NOT_believe NOT_that NOT_those NOT_praising NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_herein NOT_aren't NOT_thinking NOT_of NOT_some NOT_other NOT_film .  i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful ,  but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless .  on the plus side ,  the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent ,  but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_silk NOT_purse .  ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in .  dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina .  peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target .  fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter b's amazingly awful book ,  killing of the unicorn . 
233 1 man oh man .  .  .  i've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term ,  there's a long list!) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so .  and "news" are: marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!<br /><br />for any von trier's "follower": both rigets ,  element of crime ,  dogville ,  dancer in the dark ,  the five obstructions ,  etc .  .  .  europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms .  everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! you really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmarish time warp .  taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel ,  bergman ,  till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard von trier leads the art-film scene as the "well intended totalitarian" movie maker of nowadays .  his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues ,  without being irrational ,  hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world . <br /><br />as utopian as it seems ,  i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect .  the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no NOT_longer NOT_necessary ,  as a tool for reflection ,  perhaps it could be the start of a new era: "the age of emotional control over our fears" .  this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over . <br /><br />bravo! 
234 0 it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter ,  ben gazarra and audrey hepburn .  they looked quite wonderful .  but that was it .  they were not NOT_given NOT_any NOT_characters NOT_or NOT_good NOT_lines NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with .  i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing . <br /><br />some of the smaller female roles were fine ,  patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts .  they showed some talent and it is sad they didn't NOT_go NOT_on NOT_to NOT_star NOT_in NOT_more NOT_and NOT_better NOT_films .  sadly ,  i didn't NOT_think NOT_dorothy NOT_stratten NOT_got NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_act NOT_in NOT_this NOT_her NOT_only NOT_important NOT_film NOT_role . <br /><br />the film appears to have some fans ,  and i was very open-minded when i started watching it .  i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie ,  "cat's meow" and all his early ones from "targets" to "nickleodeon" .  so ,  it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one . <br /><br />it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other .  five years later ,  bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend ,  cybil shepherd had a hit television series called "moonlighting" stealing the story idea from bogdanovich .  of course ,  there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue ,  while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines . <br /><br />bottom line: it ain't NOT_no NOT_"paper NOT_moon" NOT_and NOT_only NOT_a NOT_very NOT_pale NOT_version NOT_of NOT_"what's NOT_up ,  doc" . 
235 1 lars von trier's europa is a worthy echo of the third man ,  about an american coming to post-world war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery . <br /><br />jean-marc barr plays leopold kessler ,  a german-american who refused to join the us army during the war ,  arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway .  what he doesn't NOT_know NOT_is NOT_the NOT_war NOT_is NOT_still NOT_secretly NOT_going NOT_on NOT_with NOT_an NOT_underground NOT_terrorist NOT_group NOT_called NOT_the NOT_werewolves NOT_who NOT_target NOT_american NOT_allies .  leopold is strongly against taking any sides ,  but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa) ,  the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company .  her father was a nazi sympathizer ,  but is pardoned by the american colonel harris (eddie considine) because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again .  the colonel soon enlists ,  or forces ,  leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains . <br /><br />soon ,  leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way ,  where everyone and everything is not NOT_what NOT_it NOT_seems .  its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything (his lover ,  the terrorists ,  the colonel ,  annoying passengers ,  his disgruntled uncle ,  even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control .  the film is endlessly unpredictable . <br /><br />the film stylishly shot ,  it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow .  its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout .  also ,  background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front .  add max von sydow's hypnotic narration ,  and europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world . <br /><br />this is now a personal favorite film of mine . 
236 0 this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch .  he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters ,  who are detectives .  these detectives date beautiful models and have no NOT_problem NOT_getting NOT_them .  sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective ,  doesn't NOT_it? NOT_this NOT_entire NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_written NOT_by NOT_peter ,  and it shows how out of touch with real people he was .  you're supposed to write what you know ,  and he did that ,  indeed .  and leaves the audience bored and confused ,  and jealous ,  for that matter .  this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten ,  who was murdered right after filming .  but patti hanson ,  who would ,  in real life ,  marry keith richards ,  was also a model ,  like stratten ,  but is a lot better and has a more ample part .  in fact ,  stratten's part seemed forced; added .  she doesn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_story ,  which is pretty convoluted to begin with .  all in all ,  every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with ,  unless you're millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call .  for the rest of us ,  it's an irritating snore fest .  that's what happens when you're out of touch .  you entertain your few friends with inside jokes ,  and bore all the rest . 
237 1 released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska holland's own holocaust film europa europa ,  this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never NOT_ceases NOT_to NOT_surprise ,  inspire or downright shock is a bizarre ,  nostalgic ,  elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii .  the american ,  named leo ,  doesn't NOT_fully NOT_get NOT_what NOT_he's NOT_doing NOT_there .  he has come to take part in fixing up the country since ,  in his mind ,  it's about time germany was shown some charity .  no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_that NOT_sounds ,  he is not NOT_a NOT_nazi NOT_sympathizer NOT_or NOT_so NOT_much NOT_as NOT_especially NOT_pro-german ,  merely mixed up .  his uncle ,  who works on the railroad ,  gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car ,  and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 germany's horrors and enigmas . <br /><br />this progression starts when leo ,  played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jean-marc barr ,  meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa ,  an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor .  she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family ,  which owns the company which manufactures the trains .  these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war ,  but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable ,  and the woman's uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs .  there is also udo kier ,  the tremendous actor who blew me away in von trier's shocking second film epidemic ,  though here he is mere scenery . <br /><br />another guest at the house is eddie constantine ,  an actor with a quiet strength ,  playing a somber american intelligence man .  he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal ,  though it is all completely baffling to leo .  americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades ,  but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo ,  who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train . <br /><br />the story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's danish director ,  lars von trier ,  whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography .  he shoots in black and white and color ,  he uses double-exposures ,  optical effects and trick photography ,  having actors interact with rear-projected footage ,  he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects ,  caught between glass for our more precise survey . <br /><br />this grand jury prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical ,  but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer .  i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism ,  symbolized by the train ,  and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads .  during the time frame of the movie ,  and the nazi state ,  and such significance to the train ,  are dead ,  but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes . <br /><br />the characters ,  music ,  dialogue ,  and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions .  the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones .  two trains halting back and forth ,  barr on one and sukowa on another .  an underwater shot of proliferating blood .  an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown .  and most metaphysically affecting of all ,  an anesthetic shot of train tracks ,  as max von sydow's voice allures us to hark back to europe with him ,  and abandon our personal restraint . 
238 0 who are these "they"- the actors? the filmmakers? certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence .  it's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shootâ— too much fun ,  nobody is getting any actual work done ,  and that almost always makes for a movie that's no NOT_fun NOT_to NOT_watch . <br /><br />ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy ms .  stratten are sweet ,  but have an embarrassing ,  look-guys-i'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them .  ben gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot ,  which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic .  in the meantime ,  the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents .  (ms .  hepburn ,  drawing on her dignity ,  manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ,  ostensibly . ) everybody looks great ,  but so what? it's a movie and we can expect that much ,  if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of vogue . <br /><br />oh- and it has to be mentioned that colleen camp thoroughly annoys ,  even apart from her singing ,  which ,  while competent ,  is wholly unconvincing .  .  .  the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack .  surely this is not NOT_what NOT_gershwin NOT_(who NOT_wrote NOT_the NOT_song NOT_from NOT_which NOT_the NOT_movie's NOT_title NOT_is NOT_derived) NOT_had NOT_in NOT_mind; NOT_his NOT_stage NOT_musicals NOT_of NOT_the NOT_20's NOT_may NOT_have NOT_been NOT_slight ,  but at least they were long on charm .  "they all laughed" tries to coast on its good intentions ,  but nobody- least of all peter bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes . <br /><br />due in no NOT_small NOT_part NOT_to NOT_the NOT_tragic NOT_death NOT_of NOT_dorothy NOT_stratten ,  this movie has a special place in the heart of mr .  bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers ,  then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't NOT_prove NOT_popular .  his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories ,  so there's no NOT_joy NOT_in NOT_criticizing NOT_the NOT_film .  .  .  there _is_ real emotional investment in ms .  stratten's scenes .  but "laughed" is a faint echo of "the last picture show" ,  "paper moon" or "what's up ,  doc"- following "daisy miller" and "at long last love" ,  it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which p . b .  has never NOT_emerged . <br /><br />all in all ,  though ,  the movie is harmless ,  only a waste of rental .  i want to watch people having a good time ,  i'll go to the park on a sunny day .  for filmic expressions of joy and love ,  i'll stick to ernest lubitsch and jaques demy .  .  . 
239 1 the best way for me to describe europa ,  which is high on the list of my favourite films ,  is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended: "i didn't NOT_know NOT_films NOT_could NOT_be NOT_made NOT_like NOT_that" .  entirely original in it's visual style ,  it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be .  it's as far away from the "master and coverage" style of shooting as one can get; perfectly integrating many layers of image ,  sound ,  effects ,  props ,  dialogue ,  voice over ,  performance ,  editing ,  lighting ,  etc .  .  .  all equal ,  none predominant .  despite hollywood's "dialogue" myopia ,  cinema is not NOT_about NOT_dialogue ,  nor is it about beautiful lighting ,  action or music .  it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing ,  where only the blending of those elements ,  in the order or combination in which they are presented ,  will communicate the idea .  reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element ,  and the film has no NOT_meaning .  "europa" is what cinema should strive to be . 
240 0 when i first saw a glimpse of this movie ,  i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball .  rachel york's portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful .  lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent .  to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous .  i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy ,  the producers decided to get rachel york .  she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough .  it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball ,  but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent .  if you noticed york's portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin ,  nothing is similar in any way-her expression ,  voice ,  or movement . <br /><br />to top it all off ,  danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible .  pino does not NOT_qualify NOT_to NOT_play NOT_as NOT_ricky .  he's small and skinny ,  his accent is unreal ,  and once again ,  his acting is unbelievable .  although fred and ethel were not NOT_similar NOT_either ,  they were not NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_of NOT_lucy NOT_and NOT_ricky . <br /><br />overall ,  extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told .  if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball ,  i suggest watching a&e biography of lucy and desi ,  read the book from lucille ball herself ,  or pbs' american masters: finding lucy .  if you want to see a docudrama ,  "before the laughter" would be a better choice .  the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in "before the laughter" is much better compared to this .  at least ,  a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing . 
241 1 it is not NOT_every NOT_film's NOT_job NOT_to NOT_stimulate NOT_you NOT_superficially .  i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day .  while this really can't NOT_be NOT_described NOT_as NOT_a NOT_failure ,  the sum of its parts remains ambiguous .  that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again .  this is a challenging ,  provocative movie that does not NOT_wrap NOT_things NOT_up NOT_neatly .  the problem with the movie is in its structure .  its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up ,  just as a second ending is tacked on .  though everything is technically dazzling ,  the movie is exactly too long by that unit .  the long-delayed climax of leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late . <br /><br />great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script ,  but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas .  the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; a character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't .  the world depicted is deliberate ,  treacherous and absurd .  keep your eyes peeled for a memorable ,  technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop . <br /><br />the compositions are stunning .  whomever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never NOT_seen NOT_it .  where is the dvd?<br /><br />it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review .  you should see it at least once .  you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew ,  but this movie ends up being richer for it .  i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does .  all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies .  after zentropa ,  von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary ,  over-rated ,  un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark . 
242 0 whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never NOT_consulted NOT_any NOT_books NOT_about NOT_lucille NOT_ball ,  especially her autobiography .  i've never NOT_seen NOT_so NOT_many NOT_mistakes NOT_in NOT_a NOT_biopic ,  ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi .  i could write a whole list of factual errors ,  but it would go on for pages .  in all ,  i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves .  if i were lucie arnaz and desi ,  jr .  ,  i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film .  the filmmakers tried hard ,  but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me . 
243 1 critics need to review what they class as a quality movie .  i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films .  europa is a breath of fresh air ,  a film with so many layers that one viewing is not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_or NOT_appreciate NOT_this NOT_outstanding NOT_film .  lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension .  the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters ,  and the focus of the conversation they are having .  other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene .  the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect ,  again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions . <br /><br />i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own ,  and really heighten the drama of the film .  a film to buy if you don't NOT_own NOT_already NOT_and NOT_one NOT_to NOT_see NOT_if NOT_you NOT_have NOT_not . <br /><br />10/10 don't NOT_miss NOT_this NOT_artistic NOT_noir NOT_film NOT_from NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_great NOT_film NOT_directors . 
244 0 i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! there are films that are bad ,  but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! the sex sequences ,  so shocking in its day ,  couldn't even arouse a rabbit .  the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism .  the film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term .  the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white .  some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle .  even the sound is bad! and some people call this art?<br /><br /> 
245 1 i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film .  story lines fail ,  and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste .  but ,  then i saw zentropa (europa) and my faith was renewed .  not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_the NOT_metaphorical NOT_storyline NOT_enthralling NOT_but NOT_the NOT_use NOT_of NOT_color NOT_and NOT_black NOT_and NOT_white NOT_is NOT_visually NOT_stimulating .  the narrator (max von sydow) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 .  we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death .  unlike many films it doesn't NOT_cut NOT_after NOT_one NOT_second NOT_of NOT_showing NOT_(for NOT_example) NOT_a NOT_knife NOT_but NOT_forces NOT_you NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_devastating NOT_yet NOT_sensuous NOT_beauty NOT_of NOT_a NOT_man's NOT_final NOT_moments .  i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means .  i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email .  enjoy it! 
246 0 oh ,  brother .  .  . after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all i can think of is that old peggy lee song .  . <br /><br />"is that all there is??"  .  .  . i was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the u . s .  i was too young to get in the theater (although i did manage to sneak into "goodbye columbus") .  then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - finally i could see this film ,  except now i was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />the only reason this film was not NOT_condemned NOT_to NOT_the NOT_anonymous NOT_sands NOT_of NOT_time NOT_was NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_obscenity NOT_case NOT_sparked NOT_by NOT_its NOT_u . s .  release .  millions of people flocked to this stinker ,  thinking they were going to see a sex film .  .  . instead ,  they got lots of closeups of gnarly ,  repulsive swedes ,  on-street interviews in bland shopping malls ,  asinie political pretension .  .  . and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy ,  pale actors . <br /><br />cultural icon ,  holy grail ,  historic artifact .  . whatever this thing was ,  shred it ,  burn it ,  then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings .  . but if it weren't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_censorship NOT_scandal ,  it would have been ignored ,  then forgotten . <br /><br />instead ,  the "i am blank ,  blank" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (i am curious ,  lavender - for gay films ,  i am curious ,  black - for blaxploitation films ,  etc .  . ) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead ,  to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that "naughty sex film" that "revolutionized the film industry" .  .  . <br /><br />yeesh ,  avoid like the plague .  . or if you must see it - rent the video and fast forward to the "dirty" parts ,  just to get it over with . <br /><br /> 
247 1 that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen ,  never NOT_in NOT_my NOT_entire NOT_life NOT_have NOT_i NOT_seen NOT_a NOT_film NOT_of NOT_such NOT_technical NOT_genius ,  the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison ,  forget your michael bay ,  ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography ,  europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years .  now i'd be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark ,  but this is stupid ,  the fact that europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema ,  whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger ,  hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) europa has been hidden away ,  absent form video stores and (until recently) any british tv channels .  <br /><br />the visuals in europa are not NOT_mtv NOT_gloss; NOT_it's NOT_not NOT_a NOT_case NOT_of NOT_style NOT_over NOT_substance ,  its more a case of substance dictating style .  much like his first film the element of crime ,  von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world ,  and much like element ,  the film begins with the main character (or in the case of europa ,  we the audience) being hypnotized .  as we move down the tracks ,  the voice of the narrator (max von sydow) counts us down into a deep sleep ,  until we awake in europa .  this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery ,  there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background ,  who is in black and white ,  will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour ,  von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot ,  for instance ,  it's no NOT_surprise NOT_that NOT_the NOT_first NOT_shot NOT_of NOT_leopold NOT_kessler NOT_(jean-marc NOT_barr) NOT_is NOT_in NOT_colour ,  since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film .  <br /><br />the performances are good ,  they may not NOT_be NOT_on NOT_par NOT_with NOT_performances NOT_in NOT_later NOT_von NOT_trier NOT_films ,  but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't NOT_really NOT_pick NOT_up NOT_on NOT_them NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time NOT_round .  but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jean-marc barr in the lead role ,  whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides ,  until he erupts in the films final act .  again ,  muck like the element of crime ,  the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state ,  left in this terrible place ,  with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate .  europa is a tremendous film ,  and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming ,  since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time ,  europa ,  much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes .  his dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled ,  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_his NOT_use NOT_of NOT_sound NOT_and NOT_production NOT_design .  but since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue ,  but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent .  10/10 
248 0 this film was probably inspired by godard's masculin ,  fã©minin and i urge you to see that film instead . <br /><br />the film has two strong elements and those are ,  (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive ,  undeservedly good ,  photo .  apart from that ,  what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness .  lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world .  she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film ,  .  .  . it's unattractive .  comparing to godard's film ,  intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity .  without going too far on this subject ,  i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society . <br /><br />a movie of its time ,  and place .  2/10 . 
249 1 *contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques ,  so read at your own risk!*<br /><br />i loved this film .  the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life .  i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen .  for instance ,  in one scene ,  leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen .  her face is huge in the back and leo's is in the foreground . <br /><br />one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train ,  a scene shot in an almost political poster style ,  with facial close ups .  it reminded me of battleship potemkin ,  that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore .  same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub .  .  . you can only see the red water on the side .  it is one of the things i love about von trier ,  his understatement of horror ,  which ends up making it all the more creepy . <br /><br />the use of text in the film was unique ,  like when leo's character is pushed by the word ,  "werewolf . " i have never NOT_seen NOT_anything NOT_like NOT_that NOT_in NOT_a NOT_film . <br /><br />the use of black comedy in this film was well done .  ernst-hugo jã¤regã¥rd is great as leo's uncle .  it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom (riget . ) this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos ,  easier to take .  it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy .  it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them .  yet some people ,  like leo ,  are tuned in ,  but do nothing positive about it . <br /><br />the voice over ,  done expertly well by max von sydow ,  is amusing too .  it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo's head ,  which at times is a scary place to be . <br /><br />the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't NOT_choose NOT_a NOT_side .  i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark ,  where bjork's character doesn't NOT_speak NOT_up NOT_for NOT_herself NOT_and NOT_ends NOT_up NOT_being NOT_her NOT_own NOT_destruction .  actually ,  at one time ,  von trier seemed anti-woman to me ,  by making breaking the waves and dancer ,  but now i know his male characters don't NOT_fare NOT_well NOT_either!

250 0 if only to avoid making this type of film in the future .  this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no NOT_cogent NOT_story . <br /><br />one might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive .  the viewer comes away with no NOT_new NOT_perspectives NOT_(unless NOT_one NOT_comes NOT_up NOT_with NOT_one NOT_while NOT_one's NOT_mind NOT_wanders ,  as it will invariably do during this pointless film) . <br /><br />one might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing . <br /><br /> 
251 1 lars von trier is never NOT_backward NOT_in NOT_trying NOT_out NOT_new NOT_techniques .  some of them are very original while others are best forgotten . <br /><br />he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey .  with so many cities lying in ruins ,  leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration .  it is not NOT_a NOT_simple NOT_task NOT_as NOT_he NOT_quickly NOT_finds NOT_out . <br /><br />his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line .  his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers .  when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles .  a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not NOT_chalked NOT_despite NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_they NOT_have NOT_been NOT_polished .  there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details . <br /><br />the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations .  in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz  .  these images ,  horrible as they are ,  are fleeting as in a dream ,  each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected . <br /><br />at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb .  in view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage .  he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock .  later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank .  looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not NOT_destroy .  subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock .  if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task .  quite ridiculous in fact .  it could only happen in a dream . <br /><br />it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train . <br /><br />despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed ,  i prefer lars von trier's later films (breaking the waves and the idiots) .  the bomb scene described above really put me off .  perhaps i'm a realist . 
252 0 "i am curious: yellow" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile .  it doesn't NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_one's NOT_political NOT_views NOT_are NOT_because NOT_this NOT_film NOT_can NOT_hardly NOT_be NOT_taken NOT_seriously NOT_on NOT_any NOT_level .  as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc-17 ,  that isn't NOT_true .  i've seen r-rated films with male nudity .  granted ,  they only offer some fleeting views ,  but where are the r-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? nowhere ,  because they don't NOT_exist .  the same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not NOT_a NOT_clitoris NOT_in NOT_sight .  and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny ,  in which we're treated to the site of vincent gallo's throbbing johnson ,  but not NOT_a NOT_trace NOT_of NOT_pink NOT_visible NOT_on NOT_chloe NOT_sevigny .  before crying (or implying) "double-standard" in matters of nudity ,  the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no NOT_genitals NOT_on NOT_display NOT_when NOT_actresses NOT_appears NOT_nude ,  and the same cannot be said for a man .  in fact ,  you generally won't NOT_see NOT_female NOT_genitals NOT_in NOT_an NOT_american NOT_film NOT_in NOT_anything NOT_short NOT_of NOT_porn NOT_or NOT_explicit NOT_erotica .  this alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies . 
253 1 zentropa is the most original movie i've seen in years .  if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir ,  then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days .  von trier's follow-ups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim ,  but this is really his best work .  it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor .  it's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future .  it's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here ,  but it's everyone's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead . 
254 0 i rented i am curious-yellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 .  i also heard that at first it was seized by u . s .  customs if it ever tried to enter this country ,  therefore being a fan of films considered "controversial" i really had to see this for myself . <br /><br />the plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life .  in particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average swede thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states .  in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics ,  she has sex with her drama teacher ,  classmates ,  and married men . <br /><br />what kills me about i am curious-yellow is that 40 years ago ,  this was considered pornographic .  really ,  the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between ,  even then it's not NOT_shot NOT_like NOT_some NOT_cheaply NOT_made NOT_porno .  while my countrymen mind find it shocking ,  in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema .  even ingmar bergman ,  arguably their answer to good old boy john ford ,  had sex scenes in his films . <br /><br />i do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america .  i am curious-yellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of swedish cinema .  but really ,  this film doesn't NOT_have NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_plot . 
255 1 zentropa has much in common with the third man ,  another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar europe .  like ttm ,  there is much inventive camera work .  there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't NOT_really NOT_understand ,  and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives . <br /><br />but i'd have to say that the third man has a more well-crafted storyline .  zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect .  perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare ,  and making it too coherent would spoil the effect .  <br /><br />this movie is unrelentingly grim--"noir" in more than one sense; one never NOT_sees NOT_the NOT_sun NOT_shine .  grim ,  but intriguing ,  and frightening . 
256 0 this film ,  once sensational for its forward-thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation ,  has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity .  it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries .  given how socialistic sweden eventually became ,  the 'radicalism' of its politics ,  once controversial ,  appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later .  and its sex scenes ,  at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials ,  look pretty tame in a modern context .  nevertheless ,  the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60's youth rebellion .  one part of the film that still holds up: its self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall' .  every once in a while ,  the filmmakers film themselves making the film .  the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle . 
257 1 von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world .  so as viewers we think we watch a "true" story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated ,  often to the point that the movie works disturbing (dancer in the dark) or painful (the idiots/ idioterne) .  of course the dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier) . <br /><br />the story is typical for von trier: our hero is idealistic ,  seems to balance his relations with everybody else ,  but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves .  the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist .  mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to (self-)destruction .  (these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark . ) the movie is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post-war germany . <br /><br />as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed: shifting and fading washed-out colors ,  screen overlays ,  action on different overlays (with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting) .  in this movie we can see how good von trier's handles film as a technical medium .  in his later works he seems to step down from this (as if he is not NOT_longer NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_technical NOT_achievements NOT_because NOT_they NOT_become NOT_so NOT_easily NOT_available) . 
258 0 i am curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism .  whatever the director's intention ,  the two don't NOT_really NOT_mesh NOT_together .  the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics .  there is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies ,  dr .  king ,  serious political interviews ,  flopping breasts ,  and pubic hair .  the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie .  other than the interesting sex scenes ,  you'll be bored dry watching this film .  unlike many other reviewers ,  i think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is .  if you want to see real porn ,  i'm sure there are better choices .  the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is .  i think the cast did a fine job however .  they played their parts believably .  there is little of the over-the-topness i'm so used to seeing in the american films during this time . 
259 1 with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity ,  this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene .  the movie plays much like a dream ,  and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it .  characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless .  but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices .  the film works isn't NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_work NOT_as NOT_history ,  but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies .  <br /><br />i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie ,  but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away .  this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever ,  and there is a wild imagination in its style .  i can completely understand why people would hate it ,  but i give it 9/10 . 
260 0 well ,  where to begin? i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed .  call me ignorant for not NOT_knowing NOT_of NOT_schneebaum's NOT_book NOT_before NOT_viewing NOT_the NOT_documentary NOT_that NOT_has NOT_been NOT_based NOT_off NOT_of NOT_it NOT_and NOT_decide NOT_that NOT_i NOT_have NOT_been NOT_living NOT_under NOT_some NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_a NOT_rock ,  but don't NOT_blame NOT_me NOT_for NOT_picking NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_up NOT_since NOT_the NOT_title NOT_and NOT_the NOT_description NOT_on NOT_the NOT_box NOT_makes NOT_no NOT_note NOT_of NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_this NOT_"documentary" NOT_is NOT_actually NOT_a NOT_companion NOT_to NOT_said NOT_book .  yeah ,  i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a "modern cannibal tale . " i mean ,  am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? i certainly didn't NOT_expect NOT_an NOT_hour NOT_and NOT_forty-five NOT_minutes NOT_of NOT_one NOT_old NOT_geezer NOT_kissing NOT_his NOT_own NOT_ass NOT_by NOT_whining NOT_about NOT_every NOT_little NOT_detail NOT_of NOT_his NOT_dull NOT_and NOT_worn NOT_out NOT_life .  i certainly didn't NOT_expect NOT_the NOT_insipid NOT_directing NOT_and NOT_i NOT_most NOT_notably NOT_did NOT_not NOT_foresee NOT_myself NOT_laughing NOT_so NOT_hard NOT_at NOT_tobias NOT_schneebaum NOT_and NOT_all NOT_of NOT_his NOT_off-putting NOT_glory . <br /><br />schneebaum is indeed unlikable .  the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't NOT_even NOT_that NOT_interesting NOT_a NOT_character NOT_to NOT_fill NOT_a NOT_story .  oh really? he was a cannibal? ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaum's dirty past .  the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had "a small piece . " that's it ,  folks .  ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches .  it's like calling a movie "the life of a true don juan" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played "just the tip . " unbelievable . <br /><br />the directing is ,  indeed ,  superbly ghastly as there is no NOT_flow NOT_or NOT_rhythm NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story NOT_that NOT_is NOT_being NOT_told .  alright ,  i understand that i didn't NOT_read NOT_schneebaum's NOT_volume NOT_before NOT_watching NOT_his NOT_celluloid NOT_tale NOT_of NOT_it ,  but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing .  one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't NOT_drive NOT_and NOT_then NOT_jumps NOT_to NOT_talking NOT_about NOT_some NOT_dead NOT_relative NOT_or NOT_some NOT_failed NOT_and NOT_miserable NOT_saga NOT_in NOT_his NOT_life .  i mean ,  jesus ,  can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru? also: i don't NOT_particularly NOT_care NOT_much NOT_for NOT_schneebaum's NOT_insipid NOT_little NOT_quips NOT_on NOT_life NOT_and NOT_living ,  but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings .  if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i don't NOT_expect NOT_him NOT_to NOT_suddenly NOT_bitch NOT_and NOT_moan NOT_about NOT_wanting NOT_to NOT_go NOT_back NOT_home NOT_twenty NOT_minutes NOT_later .  absurd . <br /><br />another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared .  while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story ,  the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels . <br /><br />the bottom line ,  here ,  is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud .  pure and simple .  i know that i haven't read the book ,  but i'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own .  this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd .  schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy ,  striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un-riveting .  if you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism ,  turn away because "keep the river to your right" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag . 
261 1 on october of 1945 ,  the american german descendant leopold kessler (jean-marc barr) arrives in a post-war frankfurt and his bitter uncle kessler (ernst-hugo jã¤regã¥rd) gets a job for him in the zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor .  while traveling in the train learning his profession ,  he sees the destructed occupied germany and meets katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa) ,  the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of zentropa ,  max hartmann (jã¸rgen reenberg) .  leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the germans ,  and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves" killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces .  he falls in love for katharina ,  and sooner she discloses that she was a "werewolf" .  when max commits suicide ,  leopold is also pressed by the "werewolves" and need to take a position and a decision . <br /><br />"europa" is an impressive and anguishing kafkanian story of the great danish director lars von trier .  using an expressionist style that recalls fritz lang and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details ,  this movie discloses a difficult period of germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war .  very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country ,  and the corruption with the jew that should identify max .  jean-marc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody .  the hypnotic narration of max von sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film .  my vote is nine . <br /><br />title (brazil): "europa" 
262 0 so ,  where are the cannibals? those intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal' appeal of this film will be let down .  instead ,  we are shown a strange man and his re-visiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives ,  one of whom was his lover several decades prior .  the man ,  tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow ,  this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes . <br /><br />there are no NOT_real NOT_cannibals NOT_here: NOT_only NOT_stories NOT_relayed NOT_by NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_natives NOT_and NOT_by NOT_tobias NOT_himself .  not NOT_all NOT_together NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_film .  very interesting and great cinematography .  schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get . <br /><br />it's just not NOT_what NOT_it NOT_claims NOT_to NOT_be NOT_on NOT_the NOT_cover NOT_and NOT_in NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_summary . <br /><br />4 out of 10 ,  kids . 
263 1 this is the fifth von trier film i have seen .  i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies .  four of them ,  the element of crime ,  europa ,  breaking the waves ,  and dancer in the dark ,  i have given a 10 ,  and one ,  the idiots ,  i have given a 9 (and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it ,  although i'd like to see it once more before i do) .  he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors .  i tend to agree with him .  i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films .  in 50 years ,  when von trier retires ,  he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from europe (perhaps from the planet) ,  and there will be classes taught in his name .  he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time .  it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this . <br /><br />about europa itself ,  i'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not NOT_seem NOT_strong .  i think that's the point .  this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare ,  or the subconscious at some level .  this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: max von sydow's narration .  we are hypnotized ,  or von trier is hypnotized ,  and this is our/his subconscious mind .  i'm inclined to lean more towards his mind ,  since the degradation of europe concerns me ,  an american ,  very little .  this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime ,  an even more brilliant film than this (although i am disputing that in my mind; what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd ,  hopefully criterion again ,  with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then ,  i am fairly sure ,  this film would seem as great as any of von trier's other films) .  in the element of crime ,  the film begins with a hypnotist ,  whom we actually see on screen this time ,  is hypnotizing fisher ,  a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish .  the first words of that film are "fantasy is okay ,  but my job is to keep you on track . " and whenever fisher ,  the narrator ,  gets off track ,  the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story .  he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line .  something along the lines of ,  "do you understand the difference between good and evil?" the hypnotist laughs and says ,  "now ,  fisher ,  she didn't NOT_really NOT_say NOT_that ,  did she?"<br /><br />so the key to interpreting europa ,  almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime ,  is that we are deep in our/von trier's subconscious ,  and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone .  what does the train itself symbolize? consider it internally ,  and only then discuss it externally .  europa is a great film ,  a masterpiece .  i was never NOT_bored NOT_by NOT_it ,  even though i watched it at 3 am .  the perfect time to watch ,  actually ,  since it works in dream logic .

265 1 storyline: max von sydow's voice-over narration hypnotizes the protagonist (and audience) back to 1945 where our protagonist the young american ideologist leopold kessler (jean-marc barr) has just arrived in post-wwii 1945 germany to help rebuilding the damaged country .  uncle kessler (ernst-hugo jã¤regã¥rd) supplies leopold with a job in the big zentropa train corporation ,  but soon leopold falls in love with katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa); daughter of zentropa owner max hartmann (jã¸rgen reenberg) .  leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption ,  being taken advantage of ,  losing his ideology ,  and is forced to chose between pest or colera . <br /><br />mysterious ,  mesmerizing ,  manipulative ,  noirish ,  haunting ,  beautiful ,  and ugly .  these are some immediate ,  grandiose ,  descriptions that come to mind when thinking of lars von trier's 1991 masterpiece europa; the final chapter of the europa trilogy .  in usa it was retitled zentropa so audiences wouldn't NOT_confuse NOT_it NOT_with NOT_agnieszka NOT_holland's NOT_europa NOT_europa NOT_from NOT_1990 NOT_(equally NOT_a NOT_wwii NOT_drama) .  the europa trilogy also consists of forbrydelsens element from 1984 and epidemic from 1987 (the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the danish cinemas) .  the trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism ,  although the themes of this trilogy are not NOT_as NOT_essential NOT_as NOT_the NOT_visuals .  in the opening-shot of europa we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us: "on the mental count of ten ,  you will be in europa .  be there at ten .  i say: ten" .  a metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dream-reality . <br /><br />europa utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style -- that famous russian director andrei tarkovsky is trier's main-influence says it all .  it's a black-and-white movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood ,  a red dress etc .  according to rumors this inspired steven spielberg to use the similar effect in shindler's list from 1993 (coincidentially another wwii drama) .  furthermore trier uses so-called dutch angels and reinvents background-projection by adding separately shot co-operating layers upon layers ,  but unlike old hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons ,  trier uses it for artistic reasons .  these carefully executed strange-looking visual techniques underline that we are in a dream-reality ,  we are hypnotized; the universe of europa is not NOT_real! NOT_europa NOT_is NOT_often NOT_criticized NOT_for NOT_weighing NOT_advanced NOT_technique NOT_(such NOT_as NOT_multi-layered NOT_background-projection) NOT_above NOT_plot NOT_and NOT_characters ,  but hey that's what reviewers criticized stanley kubrick's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001: a space odyssey for -- nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema-history books . <br /><br />europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness .  apparently trier assigns the nazis' werewolf terrorist-group too much historical significance .  according to various online-sources that's correct (a fascinating subject - try googl'ing it yourself!) ,  yet trier's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately .  europa is a never-ending nightmare .  leopold kessler is hypnotized ,  therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality .  equally it shows how our memory deceives us -- a 100% accurate reconstruction is a lie! although young audiences who experience europa are too young to have memories from wwii ,  we have a collective memory of it from various bbc documentaries ,  so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose: they inform us us that we are not NOT_in NOT_post-wwii NOT_germany NOT_1945 ,  but in leopolds memory of it . <br /><br />all three europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence .  the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities .  before ,  during and after shooting europa in 1990 in poland ,  lars von trier and co-writer niels vã¸rsel were extremely interested in wwii .  it shows .  it's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the time-period spot-on .  a great example is the old polish church (europa was shot in poland primarily for economic reasons) in the last act of europa .  as with 2001: space odyssey i think europa will receive it's rightfully deserved place in cinema-history .  its method of twisting old film-noir love-affair clichã©s and visual techniques is so unique ,  strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays ,  or any other dream-factory for that matter . <br /><br />europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog .  some write it off as pure commercial speculation ,  but that would be catastrophic .  it's right up there with other trier classics and semi-classics such as forbrydelsens element from 1984 ,  the tv-series riget from 1993 and dogville from 2003 .  it's a unique experience from before trier cared for his actors ,  and before the dogme95 manifesto .  watch it!

267 1 a few years ago ,  a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat' on it .  after we finished that movie ,  and were about to stand up ,  we saw that there is another film just after ,  tough on the cassette's envelope the owner didn't NOT_write NOT_it NOT_up .  yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening ,  which lacked credits . <br /><br />some two hours later ,  i just sat there wondering: how could i not NOT_have NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_this NOT_masterpiece NOT_before? .  .  . <br /><br />this film was europa .  lars von trier woke film noir from the dead ,  deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets ,  yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war german photographs i saw .  and then the tricky cuts!<br /><br />the story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no NOT_happy NOT_end .  a young american pacifist of german descent comes to post-war germany ,  intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped .  but he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance .  he hires with zentropa ,  a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on mitropa) ,  whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash .  our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf ,  nazi post-war terrorists .  when he doesn't NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_world NOT_(or NOT_just NOT_europeans) NOT_anymore ,  in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved . <br /><br />as a final note ,  for historical correctness: in the real world ,  the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies ,  they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup .  after an ss unit assassinated the major of allied-occupied aachen ,  two months before the capitulation ,  the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines ,  the werewolf .  but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training ,  and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants ,  with hitler's death and the war's end it all fell apart . <br /><br />however ,  the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers .  they feared the werewolf everywhere ,  suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians) .  for example ,  when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombed-out bremen ,  or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin .  the effect was strongest on the soviets ,  who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) 'preemptively' on suspicion of being werewolf ,  and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died . 
268 0 this movie in away was super-clever .  it's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made .  valentine makes zero attempt to be original .  what is valentine anyway? it's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier .  there is nothing original in valentine .  <br /><br />i only saw it once ,  and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off .  1 . prom night 2 . carrie 3 . scream 4 . any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody . <br /><br />i know there is more ,  but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came . <br /><br />valentine had no NOT_chance NOT_of NOT_being NOT_a NOT_good NOT_movie .  how come every horror movie has to have a "suprise" killer ,  people you don't NOT_care NOT_about NOT_because NOT_their NOT_emotions NOT_take NOT_a NOT_turn NOT_every NOT_other NOT_scene .  one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b--ch ,  then she's an insecure woman ,  and so on and son on . <br /><br />normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore ,  once again valentine doesn't NOT_have NOT_this .  it was as if they tried to make it pg-13 but failed ,  so they left the edit .  <br /><br />do not NOT_see NOT_this NOT_overly-inspired ,  rip-off unless you hate yourself ,  and you want to die . <br /><br />*1/2 (3) -j . leonard rollins- 
269 1 someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part ,  and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece .  as it stands ,  "zentropa" (or "europa" as it is referred to outside the us) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe ,  namely the decimated german landscape ,  whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people .  von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen .  you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes ,  while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge ,  especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train .  literally ,  when you see this movie ,  you are witnessing the evolution of an art form .  <br /><br />for some reason ,  von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this .  and while his "breaking the waves" and "dancer in the dark" are classics in their own right ,  it is with "zentropa" that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights .  10/10 ,  ages like a fine wine ,  and begs for a dvd release . 
270 0 here was no NOT_effort NOT_put NOT_into NOT_valentine NOT_to NOT_prevent NOT_it NOT_from NOT_being NOT_just NOT_another NOT_teenage NOT_slasher NOT_film ,  a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so .  i've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies ,  including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie ,  and as much as i hate to be redundant ,  the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_anything .  the punch bowl over poor jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`hey everyone ,  this is the director ,  and the following is my carrie-rip-off scene .  enjoy!') .  but that's just a suggestion . <br /><br />(spoilers) the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured .  we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning ,  she gets killed ,  people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone ,  and then they start to get killed .  the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful ,  but they have no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_to NOT_do NOT_it .  take jason ,  for example .  here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had ,  and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated ,  he is assumed to carry some significance .  besides that ,  and more importantly ,  he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade ,  and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine's day cards .  <br /><br />it is not NOT_uncommon NOT_for NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_to NOT_be NOT_deliberately NOT_and NOT_sometimes NOT_successfully NOT_misled NOT_by NOT_the NOT_behavior NOT_of NOT_one NOT_or NOT_more NOT_characters NOT_that NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_be NOT_prime NOT_suspects ,  and jason is a perfect example of the effort ,  but not NOT_such NOT_a NOT_good NOT_example NOT_of NOT_a NOT_successful NOT_effort .  sure ,  i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer ,  but that's not NOT_the NOT_point .  we know from early on that he is terrible with women ,  which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film ,  but then in the middle of the film ,  he appears at a party ,  smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls ,  and then gives them a hateful look and walks away ,  disappearing from the party and from the movie with no NOT_explanation .  we already know he is a cardboard character ,  but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him . <br /><br />on the positive side ,  the killer's true identity was ,  in fact ,  made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also ,  unfortunately ,  yet another rip-off .  early in the film ,  when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel ,  he makes no NOT_sound ,  suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female ,  rather than a male as everyone suspects .  but then for the rest of the film ,  we just have this stolid ,  relentless ,  unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife .  director jamie blanks (who ,  with all due respect ,  looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by halloween .  this is ,  of course ,  completely unnecessary ,  because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film .  the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer's is that michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_nosebleeds .  this stuff is shameless .  <br /><br />at the end ,  there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal) ,  but then we see adam's nose start to bleed as he holds kate ,  his often reluctant girlfriend ,  and we know that he's been the killer all along .  nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act ,  and these unexplained nosebleeds were not NOT_exactly NOT_the NOT_cleverest NOT_way NOT_to NOT_identify NOT_the NOT_true NOT_killer NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film .  valentine is not NOT_scary NOT_(i NOT_watched NOT_it NOT_in NOT_an NOT_empty NOT_house NOT_by NOT_myself NOT_after NOT_midnight ,  and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember ,  and even i wasn't NOT_scared) ,  and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't NOT_so NOT_obvious NOT_that NOT_they NOT_were NOT_just NOT_going NOT_to NOT_die .  i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than battlefield earth) ,  but the end result is the same old thing . 
271 1 it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series ,  from one to seven .  and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never NOT_guessed NOT_that NOT_the NOT_puppets NOT_would NOT_be NOT_in NOT_pain .  plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn't NOT_see NOT_and NOT_i NOT_what NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it NOT_so NOT_badly NOT_like NOT_part NOT_two .  it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans ,  which is cool ,  and showed the return of the puppet master from part one .  it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool ,  it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did . so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit . 
272 0 ***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality? it awfully seems so .  first of all ,  this is a noble premise that could've been utilized well .  a rejected young nerd who grows up ,  stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high? can't NOT_say NOT_you NOT_had NOT_nothing NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with .  but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers .  everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike .  we know the pattern by now .  these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute .  let me ask you something: who ,  in their right mind ,  is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark ,  dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses? does that make any damn sense at all?<br /><br />"valentine" is only occasionally innovative .  one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards' character .  she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw .  there's some good songs in the soundtrack ,  including one cool track by orgy .  the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd . <br /><br />even the acting is mediocre at best .  the actors all sleep through their roles .  of course ,  david boreanaz is often stoic ,  even in his portrayal as the title character on "angel . " denise richards is a fine actress ,  though ,  and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie . <br /><br />"valentine" is just like you'd expect: pretentious ,  implausible ,  forgettable ,  cheesy and without a good scare in sight .  don't NOT_even NOT_bother . <br /><br />my score: 4 (out of 10) 
273 1 this movie is a great way for the series to finally end .  peter (the boy from puppet master iii) is all grown up and is now the puppet master .  well ,  this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets .  most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii ,  puppet master iii ,  puppet master 4 ,  puppet master 5 ,  curse of the puppet master ,  and retro puppet master (sorry .  .  .  but i guess paramount wouldn't NOT_let NOT_them NOT_use NOT_scenes NOT_from NOT_1) .  personally i wish puppet master vs .  demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say "this is the final movie in the series .  .  . " 
274 0 its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher' movies .  they are so unbelievably formulaic .  and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier ,  i'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams ,  i know what you did last summers ,  and urban legends . <br /><br />valentine offers nothing new to this genre ,  except a better than usual ending which ,  of course ,  leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel .  as always ,  a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women ,  killing the main character's friends ,  one by one ,  in typically over the top style .  lots of t&a on display ,  no NOT_character NOT_development ,  bad acting ,  and overly elaborate bloodshed . <br /><br />the thing i can't NOT_stand NOT_about NOT_these NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_movies NOT_is NOT_that NOT_they NOT_pass NOT_themselves NOT_off NOT_as NOT_'who NOT_done NOT_its?' .  the thing is that they aren't NOT_because NOT_the NOT_motive NOT_is NOT_only NOT_revealed NOT_once NOT_the NOT_killer NOT_has NOT_unmasked ,  and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered .  usually something that was never NOT_made NOT_at NOT_all NOT_clear NOT_during NOT_the NOT_film NOT_anyway NOT_(eg .  main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog) .  everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect' ,  but they are more 'red herrings' than suspects .  as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed . <br /><br />valentine followed this formula almost to the letter .  ***************spoiler!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway)*************** in valentine the motive was not NOT_revealed ,  but more ,  left for you to think about given that the film didn't NOT_quite NOT_conclude NOT_in NOT_the NOT_typical NOT_'teen NOT_slash' NOT_way .  the issue is only part resolved ,  and the goal of the lead killer may or may not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_fulfilled NOT_by NOT_surviving NOT_the NOT_bloodshed NOT_and NOT_killing NOT_almost NOT_everybody .  will the killer want more ,  or were the demons truly vanquished?<br /><br />this still didn't NOT_make NOT_valentine NOT_a NOT_good NOT_film ,  instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual ,  which still doesn't NOT_count NOT_for NOT_much .  to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines ,  please don't .  originality is so important ,  and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre . 
275 1 after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie ,  i was doubtful of giving it a go ,  but i had â£3 . 99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & i'm glad i did ,  i enjoyed it .  directed by the star of films such as chain reaction ,  the ring ,  bourne identity , (brian cox) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't NOT_at NOT_all ,  i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider-man 2 the character doc ock .  he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film .  of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew's name ,  and that made me get it! and no NOT_his NOT_part NOT_isn't NOT_big NOT_at NOT_all ,  it's very short at the very end of the film ,  it's not NOT_a NOT_big NOT_part NOT_which NOT_makes NOT_me NOT_believe NOT_thats NOT_why NOT_people NOT_hate NOT_the NOT_film .  i suggest you give it a go .  some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing ,  the acting ,  and a bit more action .  but it's watchable . 
276 0 the good: i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me .  the acting wasn't NOT_too NOT_bad ,  and the "cupid" killer was believable and disturbing . <br /><br />the bad: the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak .  there just wasn't NOT_much NOT_to NOT_it .  the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting .  i do not NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_anyone NOT_who NOT_can NOT_not NOT_handle NOT_gore . <br /><br />overall: a good scare ,  but a bad story . <br /><br />** out of ***** 
277 1 i don't NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_the NOT_other NOT_comments NOT_focus NOT_on NOT_mcconaughey .  he has never NOT_been NOT_a NOT_very NOT_interesting NOT_film NOT_actor .  <br /><br />the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit .  alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo ,  definitely not NOT_stock NOT_types .  although one can't NOT_say NOT_their NOT_characters NOT_are NOT_well NOT_developed NOT_that NOT_doesn't NOT_make NOT_them NOT_any NOT_less NOT_funny . <br /><br />the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog ,  so that was certainly not NOT_a NOT_problem .  the use of spanish gives it more authenticity .  <br /><br />a very underrated movie ,  judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it .  i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least .  a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting . 
278 0 this movie was rented by a friend .  her choice is normally good .  i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie .  although it<br /><br />was a horror movie .  which i don't NOT_prefer .  but no NOT_horror NOT_came NOT_to NOT_mind NOT_while NOT_watching NOT_the NOT_movie .  it was a dull , <br /><br />not very entertaining movie .  the appearance of denise richards<br /><br />was again a pleasure for the eye .  but that's it .  we (the four of us)<br /><br />we're a little bit disappointed .  but feel free to see this movie and<br /><br />judge it yourself . 
279 1 first of all ,  riget is wonderful .  good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time .  nice combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story together with good music and great actors .  but unfortunately there's no NOT_'the NOT_end' .  as for me it's unacceptable .  i was thinking .  .  .  how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse?  .  .  . and i have some idea .  i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different .  i'm sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldn't NOT_be NOT_the NOT_same .  so here's my suggestion .  mayble little bit stupid ,  maybe not .  i know that lars likes to experiment .  so why not NOT_to NOT_make NOT_small NOT_experiment NOT_with NOT_riget3? NOT_i NOT_think NOT_the NOT_only NOT_solution NOT_here NOT_is NOT_to NOT_create NOT_puppet-driven NOT_animation NOT_(like NOT_for NOT_example NOT_"team NOT_america" NOT_by NOT_trey NOT_parker) NOT_or NOT_even NOT_computer NOT_3d NOT_animation .  i know it's not NOT_the NOT_same NOT_as NOT_real NOT_actors ,  but in principle i believe it could work .  .  .  only this way it's possible to make actors alive again .  for riget fans this shouldn't be so big difference - if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie .  the most important thing now is the story .  it's completely understandable that it's not NOT_possible NOT_to NOT_create NOT_riget NOT_3 NOT_with NOT_the NOT_actors NOT_nowadays .  so why not NOT_to NOT_play NOT_with NOT_animation? NOT_and .  .  .  look for the possibilities that it gives to you! even marketing one! great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation .  just dreams?<br /><br />i hope to see riget 3 someday .  .  .  or even to see just the script .  i'm curious how the story ends .  .  .  and as i expect- everybody here do . <br /><br />greets ,  slaj<br /><br />ps: i'm not NOT_talking NOT_about NOT_the NOT_"kingdom NOT_hospital" NOT_by NOT_stephen NOT_king NOT_;-) 
280 0 valentine is a horrible movie .  this is what i thought of it:<br /><br />acting: very bad .  katherine heigl can not NOT_act .  the other's weren't NOT_much NOT_better . <br /><br />story: the story was okay ,  but it could have been more developed .  this movie had the potential to be a great movie ,  but it failed . <br /><br />music: yes ,  some of the music was pretty cool . <br /><br />originality: not NOT_very NOT_original .  the name `paige prescott' recognize prescott?<br /><br />bottom line: don't NOT_see NOT_valentine .  it's a really stupid movie . <br /><br />1/10<br /><br /> 
281 1 normally i don't NOT_like NOT_series NOT_at NOT_all .  they're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast . <br /><br />these series however ,  are well played ,  the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one ,  the story will still be catching your mind . <br /><br />the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital . 
282 0 this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre .  a masked killer stalks young ,  pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways ,  none of which are particularly inventive . <br /><br />it's not NOT_scary ,  it's not NOT_clever ,  and it's not NOT_funny .  so what was the point of it? 
283 1 more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von trier's fantastic horror satire the kingdom .  .  .  much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more .  plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role .  .  . 
284 0 firstly ,  there are some good things about this film ,  but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie .  in the advertising of this movie ,  that i've seen ,  a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it ,  but she's a poor actress ,  and not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_looking NOT_as NOT_people NOT_try NOT_to NOT_make NOT_her NOT_out NOT_to NOT_be NOT_(not NOT_that NOT_that NOT_has NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_movie) .  and what's with that look she gives everyone? perhaps it's part of the character ,  but like i said ,  the acting .  .  .  still ,  the writing is fine .  you know who it is all throughout the movie ,  and you can almost predict what is about to happen ,  but not NOT_in NOT_an NOT_irritating NOT_way .  i think the book it's based on is probably good ,  judging by the plot line ,  but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this . 
285 1 second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit danish tv-series is slightly inferior to the first one ,  but has plenty of laughs and scares as well .  this time ,  udo kier plays two parts ,  as the monster baby and his demon-like father .  other standout parts this time are sã¸ren pilmarkâ´s doctor krogshoj ,  who must face the horrible revenge of dr .  helmer ,  and once again ,  patient mrs .  drusse tries to solve the mysteries ,  miss marple-style .  ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo jã¤regã¥rd (dr .  helmer) and kirsten rolffes (mrs .  drusse) ,  you wonder how theyâ´re ever going to be able making part iii ,  but i hope von trier will give it a shot .  sadly ,  morten rotne leffers ,  the downâ´s syndrome dishwasher #2 ,  died shortly after ,  as well .  look for stellan skarsgã¥rd in a cameo .  *** 
286 0 in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th ,  valentine fails .  why did people like halloween? because it was original ,  new and went beyond anything that's ever been done .  why did they like scream? because at least it made sense .  valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever .  the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it's not NOT_funny .  and the moment the killer comes on screen ,  you know who it is ,  it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable .  the teen slasher genre is dead get over it!<br /><br />0 out of 10 
287 1 riget ii is a good sequel ,  but not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_the NOT_first NOT_one .  this series don't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_serious NOT_as NOT_the NOT_first NOT_one .  there are much more comedy in this ,  good one ,  though . <br /><br />we're back at the danish rigshospitalet ,  the danish national hospital .  mrs .  drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done ,  but fate want's it otherwise .  she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdom . <br /><br />this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous .  by all means lot of fun ,  but it makes you take the series a little less serious .  the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones .  it's well written ,  but some of the new elements are just kind of silly ,  but they save it by making it more like a comedy .  good story ,  but not NOT_as NOT_good ,  original and thrilling as the first series . <br /><br />the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast .  they are all very good .  it's an odd story and setting .  some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not NOT_an NOT_easy NOT_job .  yet ,  these actors handle this whole situation perfectly . <br /><br />much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact .  the cinematography is one of those qualities .  the hand-held camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series .  it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities .  good ,  movement ,  great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch . <br /><br />be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first .  also be prepared to see some more .  i didn't NOT_think NOT_that NOT_green NOT_thing NOT_looked NOT_all NOT_too NOT_good .  thought it was unoriginal and didn't NOT_fit .  never NOT_the NOT_less ,  the effects like the ghosts are really good .  the non-digital effects looks good too .  little brother looks just really odd ,  but you accept it .  all over i'd say effects are from ok to good . <br /><br />the music is also quite good .  moody and nice .  some of it are really touching .  it fits really nice .  as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well . <br /><br />all together this makes a good sequel .  if you'd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed .  it has many of the same qualities as the first series .  however ,  i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this .  these two makes up a series you don't NOT_wanna NOT_miss . 
288 0 there is no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_how NOT_really ,  really ,  really bad this movie is .  it's a shame that i actually sat through this movie ,  this very tiresome and predictable movie .  what's wrong with it? acting: there is not NOT_one NOT_performance NOT_that NOT_is NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_close NOT_to NOT_even NOT_being NOT_sub-par NOT_(atleast NOT_they NOT_are NOT_all NOT_very NOT_pretty) .  soundtrack (songs): "if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film!"; soundtrack (score): okay ,  but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days .  don't NOT_even NOT_get NOT_me NOT_started NOT_on NOT_the NOT_"what NOT_the NOT_hell?" NOT_moments ,  here are a few: killer can move at the speed of light--door opens actress turns ,  no NOT_one NOT_is NOT_there ,  turns back ,  there is something sitting in front of her . ; out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill ,  a really big one! the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in ,  but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in .  i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say "where'd you get the power drill?" .  i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words .  i will give this 2 out of ten stars .  one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage .  seriously ,  do not NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_with NOT_this NOT_one . 
289 1 wow .  .  .  5 more hours of riget .  lars continues the great combination of occult ,  dark horror and soap-opera drama .  picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off(complete with the same high intensity and suspense ,  though that doesn't NOT_last; NOT_for NOT_better NOT_or NOT_worse) ,  this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste .  .  .  in the last series ,  there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode ,  whereas in this ,  it clearly is one long stretch .  .  .  where one episode ends ,  the next begins .  a lot can be said about lars von trier .  .  .  but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric .  both qualities show in this .  the plot continues its excellence ,  now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention .  basically every character from the first returns ,  at least as far as the main roles go .  the pacing isn't NOT_as NOT_sharp NOT_as NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_part ,  and i found myself less gripped by this one .  that is not NOT_in NOT_any NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_way NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_this NOT_didn't NOT_involve NOT_me ,  though .  .  .  i still found myself constantly watching ,  and at several points reacting strongly ,  often out loud ,  to what was going on(extremely unusual behavior for me ,  as i am an incredibly silent person) ,  as i also was during the first .  like the first ,  this also brings up some loaded ethical questions .  building on the foundation from the first ,  this brings the story further .  .  .  and being a sequel ,  the scope is also bigger .  grander .  more spirits ,  more bizarre occurrences ,  more subplots .  the strong graphic material of the first also returns ,  and it's been kicked up a notch .  the characters are developed further .  the acting is amazing ,  as that of the first .  udo kier solidifies his immense talent ,  to anyone who doubted it .  playing a very difficult character(anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean) *and* acting in a language he didn't NOT_speak(he NOT_was NOT_later NOT_dubbed) .  .  .  and still handing in such a strong performance .  the cinematography remains great ,  and is still very hand-held ,  with rapid zooms and the occasional long take .  the editing is sharp ,  with a few direct cuts in sound(though these were more prominent in the first) .  now ,  with all that said ,  i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 .  .  .  or at least just under ,  like the first four episodes .  i truly enjoyed watching ,  and i don't NOT_regret NOT_it NOT_in NOT_the NOT_least .  but this does have shortcomings .  .  .  the ones the first part had and more .  as the first ,  the humor just takes up too much space .  .  .  and this time around ,  it's even worse .  there are several new regular characters that are there for no NOT_other NOT_reason NOT_than NOT_to NOT_provide NOT_comic NOT_relief .  .  .  three of them ,  no NOT_less .  scenes are set up and executed for no NOT_other NOT_reason NOT_than NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_laugh .  fine for a comedy ,  but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant ,  yes ,  nothing short of sadistic at times ,  horror piece? helmer's solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof .  .  .  from which he could see his beloved sweden .  .  .  to a bathroom .  with an angle from inside the bowl .  no ,  you read that right .  in general ,  the humor seems more low-brow .  .  .  more sex and bodily function jokes ,  which ,  again ,  begs the question "why?" .  whilst most of the writing is excellent ,  some of it is downright dire .  several scenes are basically copied from the first mini-series(one would guess due to their popularity when it aired) .  at times ,  the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first ,  and it jumps too much at times .  fortunately seldom ,  but still noticeably ,  plot points and items are explained away too easily(a certain character living in denmark for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason ,  for example .  .  .  anyone who's seen it knows who i'm speaking of) .  the two dishwashers ,  while still mysterious and insightful ,  become too much of a gimmick .  .  .  too overexposed ,  in the end ,  i guess .  most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable ,  though .  in addition to that ,  i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good .  .  .  definitely enjoyable ,  compelling ,  powerful .  .  .  and in my humble opinion ,  it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first(though if belong in that group; do not NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_feel NOT_that NOT_the NOT_story NOT_is NOT_finished NOT_after NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_any NOT_more NOT_than NOT_you NOT_did NOT_after NOT_the NOT_first) .  i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from .  i urge anyone who's even considering watching this to make sure you've seen all of the first before you do .  .  .  i bought this before i bought the first ,  but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that ,  and i can't NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_how NOT_glad NOT_i NOT_am NOT_that NOT_i NOT_did .  though this features a brief summary of the events in the first ,  there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn't NOT_see NOT_it NOT_before NOT_watching NOT_this .  slightly lesser sequel ,  but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first .  8/10 
290 0 there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i don't NOT_know NOT_where NOT_to NOT_begin .  i will say this though; here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school .  you know ,  the ones with batman exclaiming "you're a super crime-fighting valentine!"<br /><br />valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony ,  one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream .  the villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable .  the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming "heyijustleftmycoatbehind!" the score is more overbearing than norman bates' mother . <br /><br />the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends ,  now grown up and extremely curvaceous .  since the film gives them nothing else to do ,  they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one .  this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton ,  who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school .  with valentine's day approaching ,  the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom .  melton seems like the obvious suspect .  only problem is ,  as numerous characters warns ,  in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome .  so (insert terrified gasp here) everyone is a suspect!<br /><br />here's problem one .  in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine ,  you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz .  nerds don't NOT_turn NOT_into NOT_angel NOT_when NOT_they NOT_grown NOT_up ,  they turn into older ,  balder nerds .  he's not NOT_a NOT_terrible NOT_actor ,  but the script ,  by no NOT_less NOT_than NOT_four NOT_writers ,  gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out .  denise richards (the bustiest actress in hollywood never NOT_to NOT_star NOT_in NOT_baywatch) NOT_is NOT_especially NOT_exploited; NOT_most NOT_shamefully NOT_in NOT_the NOT_blatant NOT_excuse NOT_to NOT_get NOT_her NOT_in NOT_a NOT_bathing NOT_suit NOT_just NOT_before NOT_a NOT_crucial NOT_suspense NOT_scene .  note to self: always bring a bathing suit to a valentine's day party .  just because it's february doesn't NOT_mean NOT_you NOT_might NOT_not NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_taking NOT_a NOT_little NOT_dip . <br /><br />the slasher in valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a cherub's mask .  here's problem number two .  the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons .  plain and simple ,  it's not .  instead ,  it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face ,  including his eyes and ears ,  can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables .  then again ,  given the things the cupid killer does ,  maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands .  <br /><br />not only is the movie bad ,  it isn't NOT_even NOT_sure NOT_who NOT_the NOT_killer NOT_is; NOT_the NOT_final NOT_"twist" NOT_is NOT_more NOT_"huh?" NOT_than NOT_"hah!" NOT_when NOT_you're NOT_not NOT_scratching NOT_your NOT_head NOT_you're NOT_yawning ,  then groaning ,  then searching for the nearest exit .  do not NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie .  even if you're alone on valentine's day ,  find something ,  anything ,  else to do .  you'll be glad you did . 
291 1 sequel to "the kingdom" is bloodier and even more twisted .  i only saw half (i was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but i loved what i saw .  ghosts ,  blood ,  murder ,  poisoning ,  mutated babies ,  voodoo .  .  . this has it all! if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you . <br /><br />also ,  you don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_see NOT_part NOT_1 NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_this .  .  . you'll figure it out!<br /><br />does anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd? sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring .  <br /><br />sadly ,  there probably won't NOT_be NOT_a NOT_"kingdom NOT_3"--ernst-hugo NOT_jaregard NOT_(sig) NOT_died NOT_a NOT_year NOT_after NOT_this NOT_was NOT_filmed .  but you never NOT_know! 
292 0 there's one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans .  everyone else: this is just a very bad horror flick .  the female characters are typical horror movies females .  they are wooden ,  annoying and dumb .  you are glad when they are killed off .  long live the strong female character in a horror movie!! 
293 1 i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting "no ,  no ,  no ,  no! it cannot end here! there are too many unanswered questions! the engagement of the dishwashers? mona's disappearance? helmer's comeuppance? the "zombie"? was little brother saved by his father? and what about the head???????" argh!! then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say ,  i know it probably wouldn't NOT_be NOT_true NOT_to NOT_lars NOT_von NOT_trier's NOT_vision ,  but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned! granted ,  it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves .  helmer ,  the doctor you love to hate! i think i have yet to see a more self-absorbed ,  oblivious ,  self-righteous character on screen! but ,  i could overlook a change in actors .  .  .  . i just have to know how it ends! 
294 0 "valentine" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think "halloween" ,  "friday the 13th" ,  "scream" ,  and "i know what you did last summer") .  it certainly isn't NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_those NOT_movies NOT_that NOT_i NOT_have NOT_listed NOT_about ,  but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "friday the 13th" film .  one of those films was the 1981 canadian made "my bloody valentine" ,  which i hated alot .  "valentine" is a better film than that one ,  but it's not NOT_saying NOT_much .  the plot: a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film .  then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up ,  then they're picked off one-by-one .  the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge .  but is it him? or could it be somebody else? "valentine" has an attractive cast which includes denise richards ,  david boreanaz ,  marley shelton ,  jessica capshaw ,  and katherine heigl .  they do what they can with the material they've got ,  but a lackluster script doesn't NOT_really NOT_do NOT_them NOT_any NOT_justice .  there are some scary moments throughout ,  however .  <br /><br />** (out of four) 
295 1 the stories in this video are very entertaining ,  and it definately is worth a look! the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks ,  with a great ,  but unexplained twist at the end . <br /><br />the seond is the best of the lot ,  and it alone ,  makes this worth watching - a man is attacked by a dog ,  which he fears to be rabid - he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital ,  but he finds out the employees there are not NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_they NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_be .  .  .  .  .  .  great twist at the end ,  and this episode alone scores 10/10! if the others were up to par with this one ,  this would get 10/10!<br /><br />the third is the weakest of the bunch - a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! there appears to be no NOT_point NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story NOT_until NOT_the NOT_end ,  with a good little twist ,  but it is spoiled by the awful first part!<br /><br />never the less ,  this is a great movie that will not NOT_do NOT_you NOT_wrong NOT_at NOT_all! NOT_well NOT_worth NOT_a NOT_rental! 
296 0 i'm in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies .  we also have access to plenty of pirated movies ,  this gem came along with 11 other movies ,  and this is easily the worst i've seen in a long time .  i've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't NOT_take NOT_itself NOT_too NOT_seriously ,  but really ,  i think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible .  it's not NOT_tongue NOT_in NOT_cheek ,  the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade .  this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin ,  which if you haven't seen ,  i recommend .  at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible .  this is right at that cusp of no NOT_redeeming NOT_qualities NOT_what NOT_so NOT_ever .  from the bad acting ,  to clichã© visual (ie opening credits) ,  to the adobe premier special effects .  they couldn't even get blanks for the guns ,  which may have to do with where the movie was filmed ,  but if you're going to use effects ,  make them close to accurate .  as for the cast ,  it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not NOT_to NOT_ugly NOT_chick NOT_that NOT_walked NOT_out .  once again ,  like ron hall in vampire assassin ,  don't NOT_let NOT_stunt NOT_folk NOT_act ,  they can't .  also ,  the comment about this being a "return of old vampire movies" .  .  . no ,  it's not .  this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about .  buffy the vampire slayer ,  blade ,  underworld ,  they're all about some super star fighting the vampires .  this is the newest vampire genre ,  with bad blood ,  fake screams ,  and cheesy over acting .  obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie ,  or friends of the cast .  but what do i care ,  i paid 33 cents for it .  anyway ,  to wrap this up ,  someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie ,  i give them credit because it's better than i could do .  of course i also know i can't NOT_make NOT_movies NOT_so NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_try .  i do know how to watch movies though .  i work 12 hour nights ,  6 days a week ,  i've seen several thousand in the year i've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack . 
297 1 like his earlier film ,  "in a glass cage" ,  agustã­ villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor .  this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see .  the heightened drama ,  intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical ,  yet never NOT_steps NOT_into NOT_it .  in that way ,  it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained ,  to be so charged and yet so understated ,  and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye .  unabashed ,  gorgeous ,  and highly tense .  .  .  this film is simply superb! 
298 0 well ,  you know the rest! this has to be the worst movie i've seen in a long long time .  i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role . <br /><br />the lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey . <br /><br />bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques .  this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts ,  however ,  even this can't NOT_disguise NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_the NOT_lady NOT_doesn't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_throw NOT_a NOT_punch .  an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing . <br /><br />sorry ,  the only mystery on show here is how this didn't NOT_win NOT_the NOT_golden NOT_raspberry NOT_for NOT_its NOT_year . 
299 1 if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues ,  let me tell you ,  you've chosen the wrong film . <br /><br />this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca ,  a small island off the coast of spain .  when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once ,  there is no NOT_war NOT_in NOT_the NOT_open .  the soldiers are sent to the front to fight ,  in the mainland ,  while another kind of war happens at home ,  on the small island .  there ,  neighbours tell on other neighbours ,  sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime ,  but many people are told on because of old family fights ,  or maybe the silent introvert who has no NOT_friends NOT_is NOT_told NOT_on NOT_by NOT_someone NOT_who NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_"earn NOT_some NOT_points" .  and these things don't NOT_happen NOT_in NOT_the NOT_open .  there were some trials ,  true ,  but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night ,  taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed .  and the next morning the bodies would be found ,  and people would have an idea of what had happened ,  but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything .  we're not NOT_talking NOT_about NOT_soldiers NOT_killing NOT_someone NOT_they NOT_had NOT_never NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_their NOT_life .  we're talking about people killing their neighbours ,  and probably saying hello to their widow the next day ,  and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed .  we're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants ,  where everybody knew everybody . <br /><br />i am from that small island and i've heard the stories my grandparents told me ,  and i must say that this film upset me ,  oh yes ,  it did; but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving .  the initial violence is not NOT_something NOT_the NOT_director NOT_or NOT_the NOT_writer NOT_made NOT_up ,  that's how things happened during that war .  a kid knowing that his mate's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad? completely possible .  all that happened later on? possible too .  tb was real too .  at that time my island was not NOT_the NOT_holiday NOT_resort NOT_it NOT_has NOT_become .  people were poor ,  illiterate ,  and worked in small farms .  after the war there were times of hardship . <br /><br />so ,  you won't NOT_find NOT_a NOT_war NOT_story NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film ,  or at least not NOT_the NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_war NOT_story NOT_you NOT_expect .  there are no NOT_battlefields ,  no NOT_soldiers ,  no NOT_political NOT_intrigues .  this is the meanest kind of war ,  which happens when the space is limited (just check the size of the island) ,  when neighbours fight with their neighbours ,  when members of the same family fight each other ,  and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody .  you'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage ,  or maybe they don't . <br /><br />i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors ,  who managed to sound really majorcan .  that was remarkable . 
300 0 dude ,  really!!!! where have you guys been the past 20 years ,  this is shocking in all kind of ways ,  horror ? this is a joke ,  there is nothing wrong with being low budget ,  but this is a laugh ,  if you want to look at the classics ,  freaks of tod browning ,  the victims of dracula and frankenstein ,  the undying monster ,  ernest thesiger ,  paul wegener's the golem and the passengers of the ghost train ,  you can't NOT_compare NOT_it ,  it gives it a bad name ,  bad acting ,  bad screenplay etc .  total waist of money and free time ,  have watched a lot of movies ,  were as horror is my all time favorite ,  i really am speechless ,  have nothing more to say that please don't NOT_do NOT_the NOT_effort NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_something NOT_so NOT_daft ,  please understand 
301 1 the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community ,  develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty .  whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level ,  caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute ,  villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco .  the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis . <br /><br />the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar's work with themes dealing with sexual desire ,  both heterosexual and homosexual .  an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic ,  gritty realism opposed to almodovar's use of surrealism ,  although both styles are similar . <br /><br />the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature .  i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing . 
302 0 this is really terrible . <br /><br />the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched ,  i would have a suitable reply . <br /><br />i think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell .  i wouldn't NOT_have NOT_bothered NOT_commenting NOT_but NOT_i NOT_noticed NOT_some NOT_fanboys NOT_(probably NOT_connected NOT_to NOT_the NOT_movie) NOT_had NOT_claimed NOT_that NOT_this NOT_was NOT_the NOT_best NOT_movie NOT_since NOT_the NOT_matrix .  let me debunk the myths and lies . <br /><br />there is nothing good in the movie .  everything yells tacky .  the actress is ugly .  the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen .  the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish .  imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't NOT_hurt NOT_a NOT_kitten .  obviously ,  the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie . <br /><br />i know the director did not NOT_have NOT_much NOT_budget NOT_for NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_still NOT_better NOT_movies NOT_have NOT_been NOT_made NOT_on NOT_smaller NOT_budget NOT_before .  unforgivable . 
303 1 film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless .  gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust ,  hate ,  murder ,  rape ,  theft and deception .  it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits .  the story is sweeping .  it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind .  roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen .  supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity .  sets ,  lighting ,  scenery and cinematography are wonderful .  i absolutely love the photography . 
304 0 you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers . <br /><br />i'm sorry ,  but spielberg didn't NOT_deserve NOT_to NOT_win NOT_any NOT_oscar NOT_for NOT_this NOT_piece ,  and i think the academy was right in that vote .  (other oscars for best actor nominations and such .  .  .  that i don't NOT_know NOT_about .  but it would be hard to justify ,  given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product . ) the way spielberg directs this is so contrived ,  so meddlesome .  while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me: "sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered .  sentimentality is sugary and unreal ,  a false view of life . " this is over-the-top sentimentality .  when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity ,  as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found? there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around miss millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel ,  as if magically entranced by the choir's singing .  .  .  on and on .  nothing rings true .  i even wondered if harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife sophia's real name ,  "oprah , " backwards .  spielberg isn't NOT_above NOT_such NOT_"cuteness . "<br /><br />it's not NOT_that NOT_spielberg NOT_is NOT_incapable NOT_of NOT_honestly NOT_rendered NOT_action NOT_and NOT_emotion .  schindler's list was amazing ,  deeply touching for me ,  and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism ,  even if the story is a bit contrived . 
305 1 i saw "el mar" yesterday and thought it to be a great movie .  it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: ramallo ,  manuel tur ,  and francisca .  after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again . <br /><br />religion ,  sickness ,  love ,  violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension-filled movie . <br /><br />i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story .  it's a violent ,  intense and sad story .  people are expected to suffer .  to cry .  to get hurt .  to bleed .  and i think that what the film shows ,  isn't NOT_done NOT_for NOT_pure NOT_shock-value NOT_or NOT_presented NOT_in NOT_a NOT_distasteful NOT_way .  i know that some people like their films "clean" ,  even those with violence in it .  but sometimes ,  a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work .  this is one of those movies .  and a great movie it is . <br /><br />the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't NOT_100% NOT_clear ,  and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie ,  it all made sense .  but it wasn't NOT_anything NOT_of NOT_much NOT_importance NOT_to NOT_the NOT_overall NOT_story ,  so i still give this movie a 9 . 
306 0 "spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning .  but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? nobody should love that . " - lucius shepard<br /><br />"the color purple" takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s ,  and tells the story of celie and nettie ,  two african american sisters .  the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers ,  an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather .  this motif â– innocence interrupted by men â– permeates the entire film . <br /><br />the film then launches into a series of short sequences .  celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather ,  gives birth in a dirty barn ,  has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson ,  a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly ,  forcing her to cook ,  clean and look after his children . <br /><br />all these horrific scenes are given little screen time ,  and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography ,  a meddlesome symphonic score ,  incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work .  the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie ,  a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that "the color purple" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes .  ten minutes? he lasted a long time . <br /><br />the film is often said to deal which "racism" ,  "sexism" and "black culture" ,  but this is not NOT_true .  alice walker ,  the author of the novel upon which the film is based ,  claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian .  her book is a lesbian fantasy ,  a story of female liberation and self-discovery ,  which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women .  for walker ,  the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia ,  black sisterhood and female independence celebrated . <br /><br />spielberg's film ,  however ,  re-frames walker's story through the lens of comforting american mythologies .  this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men .  a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations ,  moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool .  a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows ,  the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins) ,  stereotypical fat mammies ,  jazz bands and gospel choirs .  <br /><br />this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike ,  readily and happily accepting their social conditions .  a film in which black people are over-sexed ,  carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions .  a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (albert lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept .  this is not NOT_the NOT_old NOT_south ,  this is the old south as derived from "gone with the wind" ,  mgm muscals ,  "song of the south" ,  warner cartoons ,  "halleluha!" and banned disney movies .  in other words ,  it's the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv .  it's all so cartoonish ,  so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes ,  that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy . <br /><br />of course ,  in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed .  this reconciliation was in walker's novel ,  but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin . <br /><br />beyond walker's hate letter to black men and spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black life ,  we are shown nothing of the black community .  we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no NOT_insight NOT_into NOT_how NOT_they NOT_interact NOT_with NOT_others NOT_in NOT_their NOT_community .  instead ,  spielberg's camera jumps about ,  desperately fighting for our attention (one of celie's kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a "home alone" movie) ,  every emotion over played ,  the director never NOT_stopping NOT_to NOT_just NOT_observe NOT_something NOT_or NOT_to NOT_allow NOT_a NOT_little NOT_bit NOT_of NOT_life NOT_to NOT_simply NOT_pass NOT_by .  couple this with quincy jones' ridiculously "white" music ,  and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith ,  scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams . <br /><br />problematic too is the lack of white characters .  consider this: the men in this film aren't NOT_portrayed NOT_as NOT_being NOT_rough NOT_to NOT_each NOT_other ,  nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood .  no ,  they are cruel by nature .  and the women ,  whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister ,  persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them .  a better film would not NOT_have NOT_focused NOT_solely NOT_on NOT_the NOT_oppression NOT_of NOT_women NOT_as NOT_it NOT_occurs NOT_among NOT_the NOT_oppressed ,  rather ,  it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse ,  that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors ,  women unable to support themselves and their children alone . <br /><br />and so there's a hidden ideology at work here .  late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't NOT_respect NOT_his NOT_wife ,  she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites .  the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them .  ie- respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't NOT_run NOT_afoul NOT_of NOT_the NOT_dominant NOT_white NOT_culture .  <br /><br />3/10 - a failure to confront sex and lesbianism ,  inappropriate musical numbers ,  countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz ,  incongruous comic business ,  emphatic music cues ,  and wildly hyped emotionality ,  all contribute to rendering "the color purple" worthless . 
307 1 this film is ,  in short ,  a cinematic masterpiece .  the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer .  the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child .  in fact ,  they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them .  later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium .  here we see what life has wrought on each of them .  one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient .  another man is a hustler who has become ill .  the third child ,  a young lady ,  has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium .  this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche . <br /><br />this film has a climax that is definitely not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_squeamish NOT_members NOT_of NOT_the NOT_viewing NOT_audience NOT_but NOT_it NOT_is NOT_logical NOT_as NOT_well NOT_as NOT_profoundly NOT_moving .  the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written .  there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film .  this is not NOT_a NOT_film NOT_for NOT_thrill NOT_seekers NOT_but NOT_a NOT_film NOT_for NOT_a NOT_thoughtful NOT_audience . 
308 0 watched this on dvd in original language with english subs .  either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't NOT_make NOT_much NOT_of NOT_story NOT_and NOT_give NOT_any NOT_character NOT_development .  there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn't NOT_need NOT_their NOT_presence NOT_to NOT_make NOT_it NOT_better NOT_or NOT_worse .  it's just bad .  the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long .  if anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg ,  fight scenes ,  and crap plot .  i'm certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy . 
309 1 "el mar" directed by catalonian director agusti villarona ,  and based on the novel by blai bonet ,  offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country .  the movie concentrates on three friends ,  and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca ,  to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium ,  lost in the countryside . <br /><br />we first meet three boys that are playing happily .  not NOT_everything NOT_is NOT_what NOT_it NOT_seems .  the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed .  the boys have excluded a young girl ,  about their age ,  from taking part in their games . <br /><br />when we meet the adult ramallo again ,  he is on his way to a sanatorium .  he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis .  to his surprise ,  manuel tur ,  one of his boyhood friends is also being treated ,  and the young girl that was not NOT_welcomed NOT_to NOT_participate NOT_in NOT_their NOT_games NOT_is NOT_now NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_nuns NOT_that NOT_supervise NOT_their NOT_health NOT_care .  it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully .  their relationship will have devastating consequences . <br /><br />roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo .  bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur ,  the vulnerable youth .  antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction .  angela molina ,  puts an appearance as carmen ,  the wife of the caretaker of the institution .  simon andreu is perfect as alcantara . <br /><br />"el mar" is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villarona's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer . 
310 0 this is not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_film NOT_as NOT_big NOT_budget NOT_children's NOT_television .  as far as i can tell ,  the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans .  this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'insomnia' .  when it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia ,  i thought "wow! a nihilistic martial arts film!" but no NOT_such NOT_luck .  although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long ,  white eyebrows .  zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off .  that's not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_sign .  i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena: warrior princess .  primitive . 
311 1 el mar is a tough ,  stark ,  utterly brilliant ,  brave work of cinematic art .  director agustã­ villaronga ,  with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet's novel ,  has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives .  and though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children ,  the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear .  this film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering: the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward adulthood . <br /><br />a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain ,  threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens .  ramala (nilo mur) ,  tur (david lozano) ,  julia (sergi moreno) ,  and francisca (victoria verger) witness the terror of the assassination of men ,  and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide .  these wide-eyed children become adults ,  carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds . <br /><br />we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium .  ramala (roger casamajor) has survived as a male prostitute ,  protected by his 'john' morell (juli mira) ,  and has kept his life style private .  tur (bruno bergonzini) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion .  francisca (antã²nia torrens) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium .  the three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war .  tur longs for ramala's love ,  ramala longs to be free from his morell ,  and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun's habit . <br /><br />the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death ,  between lust and love ,  and between devotion and destruction is played out .  to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer ,  but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved (in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable .  for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense .  the actors ,  both as children and as adults ,  are splendid: roger cassamoor ,  bruno bergonzini and antã²nia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles .  the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director's vision .  a tough film ,  this ,  but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath .  in spanish with english subtitles . <br /><br />grady harp 
312 0 zu warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid . the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something . whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god /demon/wizard thing . the plot line is either not NOT_there NOT_or NOT_extremely NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_you NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_insanely NOT_intelligent NOT_to NOT_get NOT_this NOT_movie . the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying , princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something . even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like (yes that's a word!) . i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand .  .  .  . who am i kidding i didn't NOT_understand NOT_it NOT_at NOT_all . it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no NOT_clue NOT_how NOT_this NOT_thing NOT_started NOT_where NOT_it NOT_was NOT_going NOT_or NOT_how NOT_it NOT_would NOT_end NOT_i NOT_was NOT_lost NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_time . i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inu-yasha at episode 134 drunk .  .  . yeah that's right you don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_the NOT_hell NOT_is NOT_going NOT_on . don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_brain NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_figure NOT_this NOT_out . 
313 1 "gespenster" question of to be cool in the german cinema<br /><br />there are not NOT_many NOT_german NOT_films NOT_in NOT_the NOT_last NOT_ten NOT_years ,  who have made me so interest .  yes ,  the problem of the most german films are in this film "gespenster" too .  he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see .  special the figure of toni (sabine timento) is too cool .  but thats is in german films always so .  everybody must to learns this coolneãÿ - is the realism in this films .  thats difficult to understand .  but in this case it makes some sense ,  because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never NOT_love NOT_it ,  because you lose it .  thats not NOT_clear NOT_for NOT_the NOT_other NOT_girl NOT_nina NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  she love her - and she would lose her .  but nina lost everything .  she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling .  there is no NOT_way NOT_- NOT_but NOT_you NOT_must NOT_take NOT_it NOT_said NOT_herbert NOT_achterbusch NOT_for NOT_twenty NOT_years .  thats so often the way it goes in german films .  why? nina (julia hummer) is not NOT_inside NOT_of NOT_the NOT_laws NOT_of NOT_society NOT_- NOT_the NOT_is NOT_outside NOT_- NOT_and NOT_there NOT_she NOT_have NOT_no NOT_chance .  this films tries not NOT_on NOT_every NOT_place NOT_to NOT_gave NOT_her NOT_a NOT_part NOT_inside .  thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination .  throw it all away - and go nowhere! but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting .  on the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls .  the have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera .  but the film stand always in some distance to seem .  there is no NOT_much NOT_explaining NOT_of NOT_them . <br /><br />in the center of this film ,  there is one scene you will never NOT_forget .  the two girls got to a casting .  and there they should say how they find together .  in this scene toni will lying on .  she said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her .  and then nina will say the truth .  she said it in an introversion way .  there is no NOT_exhibition NOT_in NOT_it .  she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here .  thats a great moment .  in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than toni goes away .  .  . <br /><br />okay ,  the film will end - in the german way of coolneãÿ - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing .  but there was a moment - where is happening something else - and this moment was important .  he is more than german coolneãÿ - and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time! 
314 0 ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 .  secondly the plot was all over the place ,  right off the bat the story is confusing .  had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better .  also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much .  it was bizarre and badly filmed .  the scenes did not NOT_flow NOT_smoothly NOT_and NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_were NOT_odd .  it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand .  i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise (visually stunning ,  the plot is interesting and good character development) not NOT_this NOT_film .  beware you will be disappointed . 
315 1 "gespenster" (2005) forms ,  together with "yella" (2007) ,  and "jerichow" (2008) ,  the gespenster-trilogy of director christian petzold ,  doubtless one of the creme-de-la-creme german movie directors of our time . <br /><br />roughly ,  "gespenster" tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin - and has never NOT_been NOT_seen NOT_ever .  since then ,  the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches ,  by aid of time-dilated photography ,  for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age .  as we hear later in the movie ,  the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie .  however ,  this time ,  when she meets nina ,  everything comes quite different . <br /><br />the movie does not NOT_bring NOT_solutions ,  not NOT_even NOT_part-solutions ,  and insofar ,  it is rather disappointing .  we are not NOT_getting NOT_equipped NOT_either NOT_in NOT_order NOT_to NOT_decide NOT_if NOT_the NOT_mother NOT_is NOT_really NOT_insane NOT_or NOT_not ,  if her actual daughter is still alive or not .  most disappointing is the end .  after what we have witnessed in the movie ,  it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone .  the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed ,  can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f . ex .  in "umberto d . ") ,  but in "gespenster" ,  it is displaced . <br /><br />since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie ,  let me give my own attempt: why is it that similar persons do not NOT_know NOT_one NOT_another ,  especially not NOT_the NOT_persons NOT_that NOT_another NOT_similar NOT_person NOT_knows? NOT_this NOT_is NOT_quite NOT_an NOT_insane NOT_question ,  agreed ,  from the standpoint of aristotelian logic ,  according to which the notion of the individual holds .  the individual is such a person that does not NOT_share NOT_any NOT_of NOT_its NOT_defining NOT_characteristics NOT_with NOT_anyone NOT_else .  so ,  the aristotelian answer to my question is: they do not NOT_know NOT_one NOT_another NOT_because NOT_their NOT_similarity NOT_is NOT_by NOT_pure NOT_change .  everybody who is not NOT_insane ,  believes that .  however ,  what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change ,  e . g .  scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made ,  although i am not NOT_sure NOT_whether NOT_even NOT_the NOT_director NOT_has NOT_realized NOT_that .  despite our modern ,  aristotelian world ,  the superstition ,  conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality ,  and that individuality ,  therefore ,  is not NOT_something NOT_erratic ,  but rather diffusional ,  so that the borders between persons are open ,  such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind . 
316 0 warning spoilers following .  superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place .  other than that ,  libelous! ,  scandalous! filmed in canada; presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast .  i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada .  nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring susan sarandon of all people! i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary; kenn borek air . 
317 1 i've seen this film more than once now ,  and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards .  but then - this is part of petzold's game: he plays along with the rules of genre . <br /><br />it's very nice ,  how the highly improbable story of how the two girls (timoteo/hummer) meet ,  is again mirrored in another ,  even more improbable story ,  that the girls make up for a casting .  this film is a journey between fact and fiction ,  it's more about potentials ,  things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future ,  than it is about actual ongoings .  it's a reverie ,  sorts of - so apt enough there are a lot of motives ,  freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis ,  like all the "doppelganger"-constellations .  <br /><br />also ,  i think ,  "gespenster" might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny: petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive ,  strangely familiar way .  this film is not NOT_about NOT_the NOT_obvious .  to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers ,  or as the story of an orphaned mother ,  who searches europe for her lost daughter ,  clearly doesn't NOT_say NOT_much NOT_about NOT_the NOT_nature NOT_of NOT_"gespenster" NOT_at NOT_all . 
318 0 i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor .  i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts .  her character's rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton ,  alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft .  the trip had been turned down by the us airforce ,  navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities .  the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base .  i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task .  i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules . 
319 1 this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival .  but unlike "yes" ,  by sally potter ,  which i had seen some days before ,  where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive ,  this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down ,  and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe .  it was as if ,  all of a sudden ,  there was nothing left ,  all hope ,  all future had been taken away to a dead place . <br /><br />nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked ,  but then ,  one lovely day ,  there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams .  there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion ,  just out of nothing ,  someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life .  that person was toni ,  a vagabond girl who does not NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_have NOT_any NOT_roots ,  just like herself . <br /><br />but the film's title is "ghosts" ,  and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish ,  there is no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_retain NOT_themâ… NOT_ghosts NOT_also NOT_represent NOT_the NOT_hidden NOT_fantasies NOT_of NOT_people ,  strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself ,  hiding away from all other people .  franã§oise ,  a french woman ,  is a victim of such ghosts .  she once lost her child daughter in berlin ,  who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket ,  in just one moment of inattentiveness .  now time has passed ,  and franã§oise is back in berlin ,  still looking for the missing child . <br /><br />nina could be that child ,  after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity . <br /><br />and nina adopts that idea ,  after all she is not NOT_only NOT_in NOT_desperate NOT_need NOT_of NOT_a NOT_companion ,  she also longs for a mother .  but in the end she is empty-handed ,  toni has disappeared with a man ,  and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman .  "marie is dead , " concludes franã§oise's husband ,  and the statement could not NOT_be NOT_more NOT_disillusioning .  nina is just a "niã±a" ,  a girl without name ,  there is no NOT_hope NOT_for NOT_any NOT_divine NOT_fulfillment .  there is no NOT_marie NOT_in NOT_this NOT_world NOT_to NOT_accompany NOT_our NOT_lonely NOT_lives .  therefore ,  in the end ,  we see nina all alone ,  about to walk along the road that has opened up before her ,  into a future that seems joyless and uncertain . 
320 0 i really wanted to like this western ,  being a fan of the genre and a fan of "buffalo bill , " "wild bill hickok , " and "calamity jane , " all of whom are in this story! add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor ,  and it sounded great .  <br /><br />the trouble was .  .  .  .  . it wasn't .  i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this ,  being bored to death .  jean arthur's character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not NOT_look NOT_like NOT_nor NOT_act NOT_like NOT_"buffalo NOT_bill . " cooper wasn't NOT_at NOT_his NOT_best ,  either ,  sounding too wooden .  this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor . <br /><br />in a nutshell ,  his western shot blanks .  head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one . 
321 1 a funny comedy from beginning to end! there are several hilarious scenes but it's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me .  creative story line with a very talented cast .  i thoroughly enjoyed it! 
322 0 if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp ,  or john wayne as a communist spy ,  then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie . <br /><br />this film is so stupid that it isn't NOT_even NOT_campy NOT_for NOT_a NOT_mid NOT_1950s NOT_sexless NOT_love NOT_story .  and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone's refusal to kiss a woman not NOT_his NOT_wife NOT_on NOT_screen NOT_before NOT_its NOT_release NOT_that NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_knows NOT_he NOT_won't NOT_kiss NOT_shirley NOT_jones NOT_so NOT_you NOT_cannot NOT_build NOT_any NOT_anticipation NOT_for NOT_the NOT_"screen NOT_consummation" NOT_of NOT_their NOT_love .  it's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't NOT_have NOT_guns . <br /><br />the story is pointless .  even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm . <br /><br />april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space . 
323 1 this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences .  its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads .  chasing the big murder case ,  you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime .  no NOT_nudity ,  but lots of sexual implication ,  slapstick silliness .  .  . everything adolescents go for .  low budget ,  but very entertaining .  definite cult classic potential . 
324 0 a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing .  the movie twists and turns through miriad plot "surprises" at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing ,  offcourse puncturing the "plot" with steamy scenes they thought would help it along . <br /><br />james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie .  the same applies for the other "actors" .  the plot is quite silly and tacky .  whih in itelf is not NOT_such NOT_a NOT_crime ,  but towards the end ,  the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring . <br /><br />however ,  the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle .  in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day ,  but don't NOT_fret NOT_if NOT_you NOT_miss NOT_this NOT_one . <br /><br />a rather lame 4! 
325 1 for a "no budget" movie this thing rocks .  i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_america's NOT_gonna NOT_like NOT_it ,  but we were laughing all the way through .  some really funny funny stuff .  really non-hollywood . <br /><br />the actors and music rocked .  the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up .  whooo whooo!<br /><br />i've seen some of the actors before ,  but never NOT_in NOT_anything NOT_like NOT_this ,  one or two of them i think i've seen in commercials or in something somewhere .  basically it rocked! luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors . 
326 0 the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite .  although turturro is an actor i generally like ,  his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying .  overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances . 
327 1 first-time director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting ,  dark comedy .  shot on a shoestring budget ,  yet had the flavor of the early coen brother's film blood simple  .  .  .  and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot! needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next .  expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor . 
328 0 i'm not NOT_a NOT_huge NOT_star NOT_trek NOT_fan ,  but i was looking forward to this .  i was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the enterprise ,  its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the treks we are used to . <br /><br />i didn't NOT_see NOT_anything NOT_all NOT_that NOT_interesting NOT_in NOT_this NOT_pilot .  i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing . <br /><br />i will admit that i did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining . <br /><br />and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack . <br /><br />but i don't NOT_think NOT_i'm NOT_going NOT_to NOT_get NOT_hooked NOT_on NOT_this NOT_series . <br /><br />3/10 
329 1 don't NOT_say NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_warn NOT_you ,  but your gonna laugh .  probably enough to hurt your stomach .  sure it's got some blood splattering ,  all in good fun though .  so ,  it's got no NOT_budget ,  who needs a budget when you got a script like this .  <br /><br />take the time and check this out .  well worth a two hour viewing .  if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live . <br /><br /> 
330 0 while it's early to say how the series will evolve ,  i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be .  there is still potential for the series ,  however .  of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential ,  too - but was sorely disappointed .  my gut tells me enterprise won't NOT_be NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_voyager ,  however . <br /><br />as for the impressions of the pilot .  .  . <br /><br />the pilot had some good ideas and good themes .  i liked the introduction .  the show's opening credits were interesting ,  with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song .  scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain . <br /><br />where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the "feel" of setting out on a grand adventure .  the plot of the episode itself was more a "generic" trek story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step towards space" merely subplot and subtext .  were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission ,  the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise ,  tos or tng .  the central plot didn't NOT_reflect NOT_or NOT_do NOT_justice NOT_to NOT_the NOT_grand NOT_theme NOT_of NOT_the NOT_series . <br /><br /> the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the "action" .  instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration ,  they could have been the story .  get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh ,  for a tv show that once again would make us think) .  make us feel the excitement of "the wind" and being on "the sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay .  there was way too much gunplay . <br /><br />we had the feeling more that humans were the "freshmen" in an established school .  new kids on the block ,  as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe .  sadly ,  the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them .  that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological .  just how do two such different societies interact? don't NOT_just NOT_hint NOT_about NOT_it ,  show it!<br /><br />i had to think of it more as `trek with an akward crew and limited technology' as opposed to `the first brave steps into the unknown' .  i wanted to see something newer and fresher .  the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven't seen this new ,  great concept . <br /><br />i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential .  there are some interesting characters .  bakula is wonderful .  blalock has potential .  the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11 .  if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme ,  we will have a show which will create new legends . <br /><br />you shoot an arrow into the air .  .  .  good luck capt .  archer . <br /><br />to the producers: take more risks and make us *think*! :-) 
331 1 one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear! rather risquã© for 1931! 
332 0 okay first of all ,  i didn't NOT_sit NOT_down NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_premier NOT_of NOT_a NOT_"star NOT_trek" NOT_series NOT_to NOT_see NOT_a NOT_cowboy NOT_flying NOT_around NOT_in NOT_space .  this is how a normal enterprise episode works<br /><br />1 archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship . <br /><br />2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged .  .  . <br /><br />in all of the episodes i have seen ,  all of the problems are happening because of archer's stupid mistakes .  oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and t'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off .  come on!!!! this is star trek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />also what was with the banana slug?? in one episode ,  hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason .  okay fine ,  little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever .  okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet!!!!! a banana slug cannot leave in a desert!!!!!!!!!!!! how dumb are these writers<br /><br />any ways ,  just saying if enterprise is on don't NOT_watch NOT_it!!!!! 
333 1 this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more .  crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother .  they have never NOT_worked NOT_before NOT_and NOT_the NOT_brother ,  william bakewell ,  gets a job with gable ,  who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick .  crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on .  their is a massacre in which several of gable's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing .  it's a good movie but not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_their NOT_best . 
334 0 anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series ,  or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series .  the borg does not NOT_come NOT_around NOT_until NOT_q NOT_brings NOT_the NOT_enterprise NOT_to NOT_the NOT_gamma NOT_sector ,  the klingons are never NOT_seen NOT_until NOT_kirk NOT_encounters NOT_them ,  the ncc-1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise name .  .  .  . need i go on? berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry's creation .  after he died ,  they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way .  no NOT_wonder NOT_majel NOT_barrett NOT_was NOT_in NOT_every NOT_single NOT_episode NOT_of NOT_star NOT_trek NOT_until NOT_this NOT_series .  i don't NOT_blame NOT_her NOT_for NOT_not NOT_being NOT_involved NOT_with NOT_this NOT_mess .  poor bakula .  he's a great actor ,  as are the entire cast .  i like them all ,  but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series .  just check the ratings .  i think more people watched deep space 9 (which was untimely canceled) . 
335 1 "dance ,  fools ,  dance" is an early crawford-gable vehicle from 1931 .  crawford plays a bonnie jordan ,  a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties ,  booze ,  and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming .  this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (william blakewell) penniless .  bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers .  the head man is jake luva - portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook .  later ,  of course ,  he would turn into a romantic hero ,  but in the early '30s ,  mgm used him as a bad guy .  not NOT_realizing NOT_that NOT_her NOT_brother NOT_is NOT_involved NOT_in NOT_illegal NOT_activity ,  bonnie cozies up to luva . <br /><br />gable and crawford made a great team .  her facial expressions are a little on the wild side ,  but that ,  along with her dancing ,  is one of the things that makes the movie fun .  look for cliff edwards ,  the voice of jiminy cricket ,  as bert . <br /><br />it's always interesting to see the precode movies ,  and "dance ,  fools ,  dance" is no NOT_exception . 
336 0 despite a decent first season this series never NOT_came NOT_close NOT_to NOT_realizing NOT_its NOT_potential .  set as a prequel to the original "star trek" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer ,  rick berman ,  who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a "star trek" series could be (which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint) .  the actual show-runner ,  brannon braga ,  didn't NOT_help NOT_matters NOT_by NOT_his NOT_uninspired NOT_and NOT_tired NOT_rehashing NOT_of NOT_previous NOT_trek NOT_episodes NOT_and NOT_careless NOT_disregard NOT_of NOT_the NOT_franchise's NOT_internal NOT_mythology NOT_(it NOT_was NOT_painfully NOT_obvious NOT_early NOT_on NOT_that NOT_he NOT_was NOT_in NOT_it NOT_only NOT_for NOT_the NOT_paycheck) .  never NOT_have NOT_i NOT_seen NOT_a NOT_series' NOT_that NOT_so NOT_consistently NOT_did NOT_a NOT_disservice NOT_to NOT_a NOT_cast NOT_of NOT_talented NOT_actors NOT_(jolene NOT_blaylock NOT_excepted)last NOT_so NOT_long .  it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires .  unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that "enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its core audience was did not NOT_walk NOT_away NOT_but NOT_was NOT_driven NOT_off .  produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come . <br /><br />simply put ,  in a teevee universe where we are given shows like "battlestar: galactica" and "the shield" the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a "star trek" that measures up and is dramatically competitive .  it is just that straightforward and easy . 
337 1 this is one of joan crawford's best talkies .  it was the first gable-crawford pairing ,  and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team ,  leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars . <br /><br />the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who ,  after their father loses everything in the stock market crash ,  must fend for themselves and work for a living .  life is hard in the depression ,  and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile ,  and they resort to underworld activity .  <br /><br />joan crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll .  she's smart ,  complex ,  and believable .  she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style .  clark gable is a diamond-in-the rough ,  masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford's character .  the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in "a free soul" ,  securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm . <br /><br />if you like crawford in this type of role ,  don't NOT_miss NOT_"paid" ,  which she did a year earlier ,  which is also among her best early talkie performances . <br /><br /> 
338 0 i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc .  after 30 minutes ,  i said to him , " you've got to be kidding .  is this some sort of joke?" he thought it was good .  i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made .  "what was it supposed to be?" i asked .  "a propaganda movie made for children?" the plot is stupid .  the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life ,  love or even afterlife ,  of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view .  .  . need some psychiatric help .  please ,  if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player ,  consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer .  .  . it won't NOT_destroy NOT_your NOT_player NOT_but NOT_it NOT_will NOT_destroy NOT_your NOT_evening .  if they had made razzies in the '40s ,  this would have won in every category .  (ps .  it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of "stairway to heaven . ") 
339 1 joan crawford had just begun her "working girl makes good" phase with the dynamic "paid" (1930) .  she had never NOT_attempted NOT_a NOT_role NOT_like NOT_that NOT_before NOT_and NOT_critics NOT_were NOT_impressed .  so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering (because they were clinging to characters that had been the "in" thing a few years before but were now becoming passe) joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress .  the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon .  of course ,  if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alright . <br /><br />this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party .  bonnie jordan (joan crawford) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear!!! however ,  when bonnie's father has a heart attack ,  because of loses on the stock market ,  both bonnie and her brother ,  rodney (william bakewell) realise who their real friends are .  after bob townsend (lester vail - a poor man's johnny mack brown) offers to do the "right thing" and marry her - they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared (with abandon) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job . <br /><br />she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well .  her working buddy is bert scranton (cliff edwards) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob .  rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job .  she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer ,  jake luva (clark gable) .  rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces ,  "spilling the beans" to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be bert .  he is then forced to kill bert and after- wards he goes into hiding .  the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake's clubs .  (joan does a very lively dance to "accordian joe" - much to sylvie's disgust) .  the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying ,  bonnie tearfully phones in her story . <br /><br />this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all .  natalie moorehead ,  who as sylvie shared a famous "cigarette scene" with gable early in the film ,  was a stylish "other woman" who had her vogue in the early thirties .  william bakewell had a huge career (he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s) .  a lot of his roles though were weak ,  spineless characters .  in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable - maybe that was why he never NOT_became NOT_a NOT_star . <br /><br />highly recommended . 
340 0 viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now that is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle ,  but ,  trust me folks ,  this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see ,  and if you're not NOT_laughing NOT_at NOT_it NOT_five NOT_minutes NOT_in ,  i'd say you've lost your sense of humor . <br /><br />david niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love ,  just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death .  (isn't it romantic .  .  . ) of course ,  he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance ,  and washes up on the beach ,  just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle .  (they immediately clinch) . <br /><br />looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts ,  (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts ,  from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute ,  to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies') ,  the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love .  we get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels ,  and girls like 'em back ,  and ,  apparently ,  all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb .  .  . <br /><br />as for the quality of the production ,  the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing ,  and the lighting is ,  perhaps ,  even worse than that ,  but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad .  there are games played with technicolor ,  (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that) ,  and foreshadowing ,  (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck) ,  and freeze-motion ,  (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera) . <br /><br />the best shots are the early ones on the beach ,  but ,  after that ,  it's all downhill .  the (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the odessa steps ,  to say the least ,  and i'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account .  the movie overall is bad enough to be funny ,  and that's about the best thing i can say for it . 
341 1 don't NOT_listen NOT_to NOT_fuddy-duddy NOT_critics NOT_on NOT_this NOT_one ,  this is a gem! young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living! she ,  naturally ,  becomes a reporter ,  and he ,  just as naturally ,  a driver for the mob! by wild co-incidences their careers meet head on ,  thanks to gangster clark gable .  in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam-shovel) . <br /><br />but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's all good fun from those wonderful pre-code days ,  when hollywood was really naughty .  joan looks great ,  and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank god she stopped the dancing!) .  gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't NOT_a NOT_star NOT_yet NOT_and NOT_so NOT_didn't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_the NOT_hero .  great to see him playing something different .  and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother .  and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont ,  who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! great fun! 
342 0 i thought hedy burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 guess not .  i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part 2 (you know what i mean) . <br /><br />this movie like scream 3 ,  and urban legend 2 followed movies within a movie . <br /><br />this was pure crap! the whole movie within a movie crap . <br /><br />bad stay away! 
343 1 i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as "just" entertainment .  set right after the carefree ,  roaring 20s ,  during the early days of the great depression ,  dance ,  fools ,  dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale ,  with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times .  yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale . <br /><br />in the 30s ,  hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining *and* enlightening audience-pleaser after another ,  all without wasting a frame of film .  dance ,  fools ,  dance -- one of *four* films that harry beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long ,  yet its characters are well developed ,  its story never NOT_seems NOT_rushed ,  and despite its many twists in plot ,  the audience is never NOT_left NOT_behind . <br /><br />with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend ,  the supporting cast is uniformly strong .  worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford's brother ,  cliff edwards (best known as the voice of jiminy cricket) as reporter bert scranton ,  and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luva . <br /><br />but this is joan crawford's film ,  and she absolutely shines in it .  made when she was just 27 ,  this lesser-known version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work .  however ,  here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce ,  crawford was a star in the true sense of the word ,  a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself . <br /><br />score: eight out of ten 
344 0 return to cabin by the lake does not ,  in any way ,  stand up to the original .  with only one main character (stanley) returning for the sequal ,  the film is not NOT_even NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_2 NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_your NOT_time .  i am a huge fan of the first film ,  the story line and acting was really good ,  but this is one movie that i will never NOT_again NOT_watch .  it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like ,  but with much worse acting .  i've personally seen better acting in soap operas ,  it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh .  i ,  in no NOT_way ,  recommend this movie to anyone ,  watching it will just detract from the first . 
345 1 i saw this movie on comedy central a few times .  this movie was pretty good .  it's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis ,  who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar ,  so that the u . s .  can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east .  some good jokes ,  including "sunnygate . " i also just loved the ending theme .  it gave me great political spirit .  ten out of ten was my rating for this movie . 
346 0 a decent sequel ,  but does not NOT_pack NOT_the NOT_punch NOT_of NOT_the NOT_original .  a murderous screenwriter(judd nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake .  still ruthless killing ,  but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek .  any humor is not NOT_of NOT_the NOT_funny NOT_kind .  total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top .  this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen .  .  . this should have happened to this script . 
347 1 actually ,  goldie hawn is from washington (takoma park ,  maryland) ,  but i digress .  this is sort of a mr .  smith goes to washington type of movie ,  with some variations but the same premise .  i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn .  the story is interesting ,  but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life .  it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time .  it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous ,  i had to laugh .  (possible spoiler ahead) .  it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up .  and the speech she made at the end .  .  . beautiful .  too bad not NOT_many NOT_people NOT_have NOT_guts NOT_like NOT_that NOT_in NOT_real NOT_life . 
348 0 *possible spoiler*<br /><br />'return to cabin by the lake' is a useless movie .  the acting was not NOT_good NOT_and NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_wasn't NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_interesting . <br /><br />'cabin by the lake' is a good tv movie .  the sequel was not .  judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this .  it seemed as if he wasn't NOT_even NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_doing NOT_the NOT_sequel .  his acting was good but it could have been better .  i really don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_comment NOT_on NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_cast NOT_because NOT_in NOT_my NOT_opinion ,  they're not NOT_even NOT_worth NOT_mentioning .  but i'll do it .  the character of alison isn't NOT_even NOT_hardly NOT_shown NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_part NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film .  all of a sudden she's the center of attention next to stanley caldwell .  the role didn't NOT_make NOT_sense NOT_and NOT_it NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_thought NOT_out NOT_a NOT_little NOT_better .  dahlia salem was absolutely terrible .  her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else ,  anybody else .  the director ,  mike ,  was a confusing character .  he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_his NOT_death NOT_was NOT_necessary .  the acting for this role was good ,  nothing great but better than salem's . <br /><br />the plot was real lousy if you think about it .  stanley ,  who is presumed dead ,  makes his way onto the set of 'cabin by the lake' ,  the movie based on his script .  he stumbles upon the director and in a short time ,  the director is dead and stanley is running the show .  yeah ,  out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not NOT_knowing NOT_anything NOT_about NOT_him .  there's some killings ,  not NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_lot ,  and the one's that are shown are ridiculous .  one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene .  another character gets chewed up by a motorboat .  and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning .  these writers must have been hard up for excitement . <br /><br />i just have to say that i was not NOT_impressed NOT_with NOT_the NOT_filming NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie .  the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast .  also ,  the new cabin by the lake was poorly created .  we aren't NOT_shown NOT_it NOT_but NOT_only NOT_in NOT_a NOT_few NOT_scenes ,  and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless .  it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more ,  but it didn't NOT_work NOT_in NOT_this NOT_one . <br /><br />there were too many characters in this sequel .  all of them except for a few had no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_be NOT_there .  the acting of what little is showed was really bad and .  .  . they just didn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_purpose NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie . <br /><br />all in all ,  'return to cabin by the lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off .  'cabin by the lake' i can take but this was just not NOT_impressive .  judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you .  it's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow .  nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_that NOT_the NOT_writing NOT_was NOT_horrible .  put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep . <br /><br />so ,  we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well .  by the way he talks ,  it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself .  quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright!<br /><br />(did the film makers not NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_they NOT_showed NOT_us NOT_how NOT_they NOT_filmed NOT_the NOT_lake NOT_scenes NOT_from NOT_the NOT_first NOT_one? NOT_they NOT_were NOT_all NOT_done NOT_in NOT_a NOT_tank .  never ,  never NOT_reveal NOT_the NOT_secrets NOT_of NOT_filming . )<br /><br /> 
349 1 sunny ,  a cocktail waitress in the d . c .  area ,  is a bit dim ,  to put in mildly .  she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple .  however ,  she saves the life of a prominent arab ,  by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official .  she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks .  sniffing an opportunity ,  presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the u . s .  government .  even then ,  she messes things up at times ,  but she tries hard and learns a lot .  she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official .  but ,  is there another sinister plot in the making ,  involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife? a blonde one? lol ,  lol ,  lol .  this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb "as a fox" ,  as they say .  sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u . s .  government very ,  very well .  she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings .  perhaps ,  the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work ,  but for those who like to laugh ,  rent this today . 
350 0 i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa .  considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel .  so ,  i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed .  i knew i wouldn't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_movie ,  but i was not NOT_expecting NOT_to NOT_be NOT_perplexed NOT_by NOT_the NOT_use NOT_of NOT_dv NOT_(digital NOT_video) .  the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't NOT_for NOT_these NOT_juxtaposed NOT_digital NOT_shots NOT_that NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_come NOT_from NOT_nowhere .  i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots ,  but there seemed to be no NOT_logical NOT_explanation .  (warning: the following maybe a spoiler!!!!) the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable ,  but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous .  i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing ,  but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning . 
351 1 a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer & as a starring vehicle .  although she ends up vindicated ,  she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo .  how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie? not NOT_many .  does this mean the female butt cannot be funny? goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects other won't .  sandra bullock occasionally goes there , for example ,  miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never NOT_cop NOT_the NOT_pratfall .  a wonderful performer .  great to see some of my favorite actors ,  chris sarandon & cliff deyoung notably . 
352 0 <br /><br />i saw this on the sci-fi channel .  it came on right after the first one .  for some reason this movie kept me interested .  i don't NOT_know NOT_why ,  stop asking . <br /><br />---spoilers--- okay .  .  .  it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie .  in the first movie ,  he had a "reason" to kill people ,  but in this sequal ,  half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no NOT_reason .  stanley killed the director due to creative differences ,  he captured the co-writer due to creative differences ,  but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? no NOT_cast ,  no NOT_movie .  he wanted it to "look real when they died"? if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie ,  use the special effects ,  man .  of course like the first one ,  the captured girl gets away ,  and stanley ends up getting messed up ,  and dissapears .  woooooow (sarcasm) .  this movie had potential .  and the saddest thing of all .  .  .  the really sad part .  .  .  i would watch a "cabin by the lake 3" .  only because i like judd nelson ,  and he's the only good part about this sequal . 
353 1 beware spoilers .  this movie was okay .  goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it .  okay ,  so the goofie foreign guy who (spoiler here) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny .  this guy's boss was good ,  too .  but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn .  these two should have had a lot more time on screen together .  they're chemistry was great .  the bathroom scene-wow! romantic ,  sweet ,  yummy . <br /><br />hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians .  to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away .  spoilers this is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy ,  and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic .  it touches on political issues ,  and just barely skims on romantic areas . <br /><br /> 
354 0 if you are planning to see this movie ,  please reconsider .  i don't NOT_usually NOT_post NOT_my NOT_comments NOT_about NOT_something NOT_i've NOT_seen NOT_on NOT_television ,  but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth .  critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it .  i will just simply say ,  please do not NOT_ever NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie .  it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours .  anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept ,  or working for the company that produced it .  again ,  i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie! 
355 1 this is a feel-good movie and nothing more .  and for that ,  it is great fun to watch .  sure it skims over political issues .  but so what? i am sure she wasn't NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_make NOT_'good NOT_night NOT_and NOT_good NOT_luck' NOT_here .  let's not NOT_try NOT_to NOT_make NOT_it NOT_anything NOT_else NOT_but NOT_what NOT_it NOT_is .  .  . light fare .  <br /><br />and very enjoyable at that!<br /><br />do we remember what 1984 was like? we've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not .  i tend to differ on this point .  goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it . <br /><br />like her lightest fare: protocol ,  overboard ,  housesitter ,  wildcats ,  private benjamin ,  seems like old times ,  foul play ,  death becomes her ,  first wives club and the remake of out-of-towners ,  goldie knows what she is doing .  .  . she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! goldie just knows herself really well ,  and she knows what she can do really well . <br /><br />she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently .  i loved her in laugh-in and every thing she's ever been in .  she has never NOT_tried NOT_to NOT_be NOT_anything NOT_else NOT_but NOT_who NOT_she NOT_is .  .  . and that's that bubbling ,  giggly ,  girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it .  .  . you are old ,  wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments .  if it even comes that late . <br /><br />i appreciate goldie for what she is: a lovable ,  comic actress . 
356 0 this movie was made-for-tv ,  so taking that into account ,  i'm not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_rip NOT_into NOT_it NOT_as NOT_hard NOT_as NOT_i NOT_would NOT_a NOT_feature NOT_film .  the script is sub-par ,  but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots ,  whether it means to be or not .  the acting is mostly over-the-top ,  but that is true for many lower-budget movies . <br /><br />the aspect of this movie that i really hated ,  though ,  was that 90-95% of it is shot on film ,  but in random places ,  there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video .  you can tell because there is less contrast ,  the colors are less vivid ,  and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second .  i'm not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_maybe NOT_these NOT_scenes NOT_had NOT_to NOT_be NOT_shot NOT_later NOT_and NOT_at NOT_that NOT_time NOT_they NOT_didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_money NOT_to NOT_shoot NOT_on NOT_film NOT_(i NOT_assume NOT_this NOT_is NOT_why ,  anyway) ,  but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look . <br /><br />anyway ,  i've definitely seen worse movies ,  but i definitely wouldn't NOT_say NOT_that NOT_i NOT_enjoyed NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_i NOT_can't NOT_recommend NOT_that NOT_anyone NOT_see NOT_it . 
357 1 "protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt .  the woman immediately becomes a celebrity ,  and gets a new job working for the u . s .  government .  will the corridors of power in our nation's capital ever be the same? hawn is excellent as usual even though "protocol" isn't NOT_as NOT_funny NOT_as NOT_her NOT_best NOT_film NOT_"private NOT_benjamin" .  but it's still a good movie ,  and i did laugh alot . <br /><br />*** (out of four) 
358 0 return to cabin by the lake just .  .  .  .  was lacking .  it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera .  so ,  within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots and simple video camera shots .  it makes for a very odd blend! i think they should have found some way to not NOT_do NOT_the NOT_"home NOT_video" NOT_type NOT_effect!

359 1 the first "side-story" in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies .  the focus is no NOT_longer NOT_on NOT_a NOT_small NOT_group NOT_of NOT_individuals NOT_who NOT_would NOT_go NOT_on NOT_to NOT_play NOT_pivotal NOT_roles NOT_in NOT_the NOT_conflict ,  but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes . <br /><br />the story does contain some gundam staples ,  its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam ,  but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch .  this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor ,  christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman .  alfred develops a sort of "brotherly love" for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christina . <br /><br />"war in the pocket" proves that you do not NOT_need NOT_a NOT_sweeping NOT_epic NOT_tale NOT_about NOT_special NOT_individuals NOT_to NOT_make NOT_for NOT_a NOT_good NOT_war NOT_story .  there are no NOT_uber NOT_ace NOT_pilots NOT_or NOT_large NOT_scale NOT_fleet NOT_battles NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seen NOT_here .  this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are .  alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool .  he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war .  the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina ,  each not NOT_knowing NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_they NOT_are NOT_soldiers NOT_on NOT_different NOT_sides NOT_of NOT_the NOT_war ,  is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff .  same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie .  that being said ,  i would not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_spoil NOT_much NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story NOT_here ,  but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending .  <br /><br />despite its lack of action ,  this show never NOT_falls NOT_into NOT_the NOT_category NOT_of NOT_"boring" .  the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show .  not NOT_to NOT_worry NOT_as NOT_there NOT_are NOT_a NOT_number NOT_of NOT_mobile NOT_suit NOT_action NOT_scenes NOT_scattered NOT_here NOT_and NOT_there .  each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some "mandatory" mobile suit battles in a gundam series . <br /><br />normally watching anime in japanese or english ,  i would leave up to personal preference .  but in this case ,  i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one .  not NOT_only NOT_do NOT_the NOT_characters ,  whom all except alfred are caucasian ,  sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one ,  instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramas . <br /><br />in short ,  this show does not NOT_try NOT_to NOT_impress NOT_the NOT_audience .  what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child .  a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given . 
360 0 preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings ,  assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered . <br /><br />film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood ,  with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses( .  . looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight .  brian krause ,  who i thought was dreadful ,  overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced ,  portrays the loud ,  temperamental director who doesn't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_his NOT_second NOT_unit NOT_director NOT_and NOT_screenplay NOT_writer ,  alison( .  . played by dahlia salem)seem to be taking over the production .  andrew moxham is paul parsons ,  who is the brother of a victim from the first film .  the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth .  nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty ,  with stanley as clever as ever ,  using his brains to commandeer a film production ,  killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work ,  letting no NOT_one NOT_stand NOT_in NOT_his NOT_way .  . that is until alison realizes who stanley really is .  alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject .  . what motivated stanley to kill ,  why would he do such a thing ,  and what led such a man down this dark path? the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller .  of course ,  you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley ,  with a really ridiculous ,  unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate( .  . quite a hard pill to swallow) .  unlike the first film ,  which was photographed with sophisticated polish ,  director po-chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not NOT_needed( .  . such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles ,  slow-motion in a sepia color ,  and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress .  this sequel ,  to me ,  just wasn't NOT_on NOT_target NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_the NOT_original ,  with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious . 
361 1 when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with ,  a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else .  this ova is kinda the opposite .  though there're only half a dozen episodes ,  it isn't NOT_filled NOT_with NOT_action ,  but emotional things .  the two main action sequences in this ,  i believe ,  are enough to satisfy me .  after seeing so many gundam series ,  movies ,  and ovas ,  i was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie .  this movie did a fantastic job of that .  what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people .  it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis .  most people that don't NOT_like NOT_anime NOT_that NOT_i've NOT_forced NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_(lol) ,  liked it .  so ,  i'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story .  if you're a gundam fan ,  and haven't seen this ,  you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now . 
362 0 ah ,  channel 5 of local mexican t . v .  everyday ,  at 2:00 a . m .  they air horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's .  it was "return to cabin by the lake" the movie that aired yesterday .  i regret for watching it . <br /><br />the original "cabin by the lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted .  the problem is that this sequel is horrible ,  not NOT_even NOT_unintentionally NOT_funny NOT_and NOT_tries NOT_to NOT_imitate NOT_the NOT_original .  ugh .  the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word . <br /><br />the movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs ,  cinematography ,  and direction . <br /><br />my advice is : avoid this one at all costs .  it's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone .  not NOT_even NOT_for NOT_lovers NOT_of NOT_mediocre NOT_film-making . <br /><br />you have been warned . 
363 1 uc 0079 ,  the one year war is almost at an end .  a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops ,  a zeon task force .  their target ,  a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes (supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga) inside .  when little boy al izuruha ,  a fan of zeon ms ,  encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony ,  he befriends newbie ms pilot benard "bernie" wiseman .  the two become good friends ,  al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team .  through the show ,  bernie acts as a father figure to al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie ,  but eventually they must meet .  .  .  . in battle .  al soon learns that war is not NOT_child's NOT_play NOT_and NOT_bernie NOT_must NOT_choose NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_ultimate NOT_sacrifice NOT_to NOT_complete NOT_his NOT_mission . <br /><br />for only 6 episodes ,  gundam 0080 is a well done show .  the mobile suits are extremely well designed ,  and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters .  if you liked 0083 then check this one out ,  or if you are new to the gundam world ,  this is a good show to start with .  if you look to a show for drama and character development ,  this is the one for you ,  it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle .  i would rate it more of a drama than action . <br /><br />mobile suit gundam 0080 ,  war in the pocket .  <br /><br />sometimes you have to lose to win . 
364 0 this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies .  once again it doesn't NOT_make NOT_since .  the killer still kills for fun .  but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie .  which means that it is the stupidest movie ever . <br /><br />don't watch this .  if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't NOT_watch NOT_it .  you'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it .  because it just doesn't NOT_combine NOT_the NOT_original NOT_makes NOT_of NOT_horror ,  action ,  and crime . <br /><br />don't let your children watch this .  teenager ,  young child or young adult ,  this movie has that sorta impact upon people . 
365 1 if you are uninitiated to the gundam world ,  this is a good place to start .  if you are burned out on star wars or star trek ,  here is a compelling ,  realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in .  not NOT_the NOT_simplistic NOT_boy-saves-world-in-giant NOT_robot NOT_story NOT_you NOT_might NOT_have NOT_expected ,  but rather a complex ,  emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "good" and "bad" guys is decidedly less than distinct . <br /><br />gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha ,  a young ,  naive boy living in a neutral space colony .  he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends .  during the course of this series ,  al befriends an "enemy" soldier ,  bernie wiseman .  by the end ,  little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice . <br /><br />i loved this oav series ,  with its cool mecha designs ,  involving story ,  and likeable characters .  i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime ,  or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment . 
366 0 this is an action western .  james steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest ,  which is filmed in great splendor .  the scenery and costumes are great .  there is action and adventure .  stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwest . <br /><br />the main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero .  even when this movie was made ,  the cynic was the stereotypical hero ,  and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces .  he is kind to his two partners ,  and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability . <br /><br />however ,  he is so piggish to everyone else ,  it is hard to really care for him ,  or to accept him .  he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters (cut not NOT_that NOT_bad) . <br /><br />still ,  the minor characters are quite enjoyable .  walter brennan ,  royal dano ,  harry morgan ,  and others make this worth watching . 
367 1 exquisite comedy starring marian davies (with the affable william haines) .  young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom .  cameo performances showcase "all the stars in mgm's heaven" in the famous commissary scene ,  plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar .  pic also captures for posterity davies' famous ,  wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day (her swanson is a beaut!) . <br /><br />"peggy , " even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis ,  turns up her nose and comments ,  "ohh ,  i don't NOT_like NOT_her!"<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>my NOT_print NOT_was NOT_perfect .  story ,  direction ,  acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados . 
368 0 mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion ,  and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do .  <br /><br />but come on hollywood - a mountie telling the people of dawson city ,  yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves ,  then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush .  mr .  mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood ,  the canadian north for the american wild west . <br /><br />canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot ,  or ,  to shake your head in disgust . 
369 1 there are no NOT_people NOT_like NOT_"show NOT_people" NOT_marion NOT_davies NOT_(as NOT_peggy NOT_pepper) NOT_and NOT_william NOT_haines NOT_(as NOT_billy NOT_boone) .  my introduction to ms .  davies was a "clip" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions .  my introduction to mr .  haines was in viewing this film ,  presently; though ,  it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role .  haines makes an incredible impression ,  when he joins davies for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table .  indeed ,  haines and davies deliver great comic performances . <br /><br />the story starts off with dell henderson (colonel pepper) driving daughter davies into hollywood ,  certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation .  indeed ,  davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars .  but ,  davies yearns to become a true drama queen .  davies leaves haines ,  and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli .  but ,  audiences prefer davies in more comic roles; perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life? <br /><br />full of great hollywood location footage ,  both on the set ,  and off .  full of great "cameos"; at a studio lunch ,  at the stars' table ,  davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s .  hart .  the best "bit" player ,  however ,  is charlie chaplin ,  who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph! while the cameos are fun ,  they ,  and the episodic sequences ,  do help "show people" become less of an important film ,  and more of an important historical document .  <br /><br />******** show people (11/11/28) king vidor ~ marion davies ,  william haines ,  dell henderson 
370 0 the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood .  even john ford never NOT_made NOT_that NOT_many NOT_with NOT_so NOT_much NOT_quality .  the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are .  ford's my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them .  or at least two .  <br /><br />the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase .  chase being responsible for the brilliant red river .  chase wrote far country ,  bend of the river ,  and probably some others .  but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine ,  but then very few films ,  western or otherwise are .  <br /><br />each of the five films of mann have huge gaps ,  or is it six ,  lets see .  bend ,  far ,  man of the west ,  furies ,  winchester 73 ,  and yep ,  six ,  naked spur .  each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene ,  with fairly glaring lapses .  yet so does red river ,  which is still the single greatest western ever made .  so perfection isn't NOT_everything .  <br /><br />but the far country has huge ,  huge holes .  it's mawkish ,  and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns .  the rest is pretty pedestrian ,  with the usual exception of mann's camera .  mann's camera is a one man course in cinematography .  it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film .  it is almost never NOT_in NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_place ,  never .  <br /><br />the far country has one amazing moment .  and as usual it comes from stewart .  nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man .  he is absolutely amazing: look at him in bend ,  far ,  winchester ,  and man from laramie: in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau ,  in far he is shot off a raft with such violence ,  it looks so convincing that you wince ,  and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man ,  well you find yourself looking for the burn marks .  what an actor .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_moment NOT_in NOT_winchester NOT_when NOT_he NOT_is NOT_beaten NOT_up NOT_early NOT_in NOT_the NOT_hotel NOT_room ,  also as well as anybody ever did it .  <br /><br />but that was mann's territory: look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west .  as painful as any fight scene ever recorded .  cooper while not NOT_being NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_convincing NOT_as NOT_stewart ,  nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight .  in short ,  nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann .  <br /><br />what a great ,  great director .  <br /><br />see every western he ever made .  they are his real monuments ,  even if all are scetchy .  but so what .  when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody ,  including ford .  and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone ,  period . <br /><br />thanks ,  anthony . 
371 1 i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of "show people" .  i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters ,  plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words .  seeing the cameo ,  out-of-character appearances of so many m-g-m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself .  i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie ,  patricia pepoire .  make sure you read her lips as there is no NOT_title NOT_card NOT_indicating NOT_what NOT_she NOT_is NOT_saying NOT_when NOT_she NOT_sees NOT_marion NOT_davies NOT_but NOT_it NOT_is NOT_something NOT_to NOT_the NOT_effect NOT_of NOT_"i NOT_don't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_like NOT_her!"

372 0 i didn't NOT_know NOT_whether NOT_to NOT_laugh NOT_or NOT_cry NOT_at NOT_this NOT_misrepresentation NOT_of NOT_canadian NOT_history ,  particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon . <br /><br />i'll leave it to pierre berton ,  noted historian ,  born and raised in dawson city yukon ,  and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush ,  klondike: the last great gold rush ,  1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /><br />the american idea of an untamed frontier ,  subdued by individual heroes armed with six-guns ,  was continued in the far country ,  another story about a cowboy from the american west - wyoming this time - driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country .  the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities ,  but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns â– that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not NOT_deal NOT_with NOT_the NOT_lawlessness .  when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle ,  the customs shack is empty . <br /><br />"where is the constable? asks brennan . <br /><br />"up on the pelly river .  trouble with the chilkats , " someone replies .  he's got a real tough job ,  that constable .  he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles .  sometimes he don't NOT_get NOT_home NOT_for NOT_two NOT_or NOT_three NOT_months NOT_at NOT_a NOT_time . " <br /><br />the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen .  the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike .  they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no NOT_nonsense .  they collected customs duties ,  often over the wails of the new arrivals ,  made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation ,  and turned men back if they didn't NOT_have NOT_enough NOT_supplies ,  or if they simply looked bad .  in true canadian fashion ,  they laid down moral laws for the community .  in dawson the lord's day act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern-faced police called "giving a risquã© performance in the theatre , " generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights . <br /><br />in such a community ,  a gunbelt was unthinkable .  one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable ,  who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly .  the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman ,  upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over .  "no man has yet taken a gun away from me , " said the american .  "well ,  i'm taking it" ,  the constable said mildly and did so ,  without further resistance .  so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece . <br /><br />in 1898 ,  the big year of the stampede ,  there wasn't NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_crime NOT_â– NOT_let NOT_alone NOT_a NOT_murder NOT_â– NOT_in NOT_dawson .  the contrast with skagway on the american side ,  which was a lawless town run by soapy smith ,  the denver confidence man ,  was remarkable .  but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law ,  which a soapy smith character from skagway â– he is called gannon in the picture â– can easily control .  (in real life ,  one of smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant) . <br /><br />{in the movie the lone mountie says} "yes i'm the law .  i represent the law in the yukon territory .  about fifty thousand square miles of it . "<br /><br />"then why aren't NOT_there NOT_more NOT_of NOT_you?"<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>"because NOT_yesterday NOT_this NOT_was NOT_a NOT_wilderness .  we didn't NOT_expect NOT_you NOT_to NOT_pour NOT_in NOT_by NOT_the NOT_thousands .  now that you're here ,  we'll protect you . "<br /><br />"when?"<br /><br />"there'll be a post established here in dawson early in may . "<br /><br />"what happens between now and may? you going to be here to keep order?"<br /><br />"part of the time . "<br /><br />"what about the rest of the time?"<br /><br />"pick yourselves a good man .  swear him in .  have him act as marshalâ…"<br /><br />the movie mountie leaves and does not NOT_appear NOT_again NOT_in NOT_the NOT_picture .  his astonishing suggestion â– that an american town marshal ,  complete with tin star ,  be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence â– is accepted .  naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal; he clearly fits the part .  but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot .  and he does .  others get shot .  even walter brennan gets shot .  stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own .  he pins on the tin star and he and the bully ,  gannon ,  blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax . <br /><br />to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north ,  this bald re-telling of the story passes rational belief .  <br /><br />â…excerpt from hollywood's canada ,  by pierre berton ,  1975 . 
373 1 there are some wonderful things about this movie .  marion davies could act ,  given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles .  william haines could act ,  and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men .  (until a potential scandal forced him from the business) . <br /><br />the story is a bit trite ,  but handled so beautifully that you don't NOT_notice .  king vidor's direction is one of the principle reasons for this .  the producer? the boy genius ,  irving thalberg . <br /><br />it's about movie making ,  and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 ,  the cameras ,  sets ,  directors directing and actors emoting .  you get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself ,  seeking an autograph .  you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman ,  elinor glyn ,  claire windsor ,  king vidor ,  and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs . <br /><br />please ,  even if you're not NOT_a NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_the NOT_silents ,  take the time to catch this film when you can .  it's really a terrific trip back in time . 
374 0 sorry ,  gave it a 1 ,  which is the rating i give to movies on which i walk out or fall asleep .  in this case i fell asleep 10 minutes from the end ,  really ,  really bored and not NOT_caring NOT_at NOT_all NOT_about NOT_what NOT_happened NOT_next . 
375 1 marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy "show people" released by mgm in 1928 .  davies plays a hick from savannah ,  georgia ,  who arrives in hollywood with her father (dell henderson) .  the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is davies outrageous southern costume .  davies lands a job in slapstick comedy ,  not NOT_what NOT_she NOT_wants ,  but it brings her success .  she meets fellow slapstick star william haines ,  who is immediately smitten with her .  well ,  davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ("high art studios") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces .  a handsome but fake actor (andre telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star .  davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life ,  but of course learns that is not NOT_who NOT_she NOT_really NOT_is .  marion davies is wonderful throughout ,  as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a "serious" actress .  william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self ,  and there are cameos by charles chaplin ,  john gilbert ,  and other famous stars of the day ,  including the director of the film ,  king vidor .  this is a silent film with a few "sound effects" as sound pictures were just coming into their own .  a treasure of a film . 
376 0 this movie has beautiful scenery .  unfortunately it has no NOT_plot .  in order to have a plot there must be a conflict .  this movie had none .  it spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it .  the picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling . <br /><br />if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't NOT_expect NOT_a NOT_story .  there isn't NOT_one . 
377 1 i'm a huge classic film buff ,  but am just getting in to silent movies .  a lot of silent films don't NOT_hold NOT_my NOT_attention ,  but show people is a notable exception . <br /><br />marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture .  davies ,  in particular ,  shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously . <br /><br />show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era .  the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film .  (i know that doesn't NOT_make NOT_much NOT_sense ,  but that's what happened . ) the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary . <br /><br />show people is a perfect introduction to silent films .  it is a fast paced ,  interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars .  add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs .

379 1 1928 is in many ways a "lost year" in motion pictures .  just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre ,  sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology . <br /><br />"show people" is one of the great silent era comedies .  the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him ,  learns his lesson ,  and then redeems himself by winning the football game ,  the polo game ,  etc .  this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no NOT_susan NOT_alexander NOT_kane .  she had excellent comic instincts and timing .  this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper (marion davies) and her father ,  general marmaduke oldfish pepper ,  fresh from the old south .  general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress .  while at the studio commissary ,  the peppers run into billy boone (william haines) ,  a slapstick comedian .  he gets peggy an acting job .  she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick ,  but she perseveres .  eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles .  soon the new-found fame goes to her head ,  and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man ,  whom she doesn't NOT_really NOT_love ,  unless fate somehow intervenes . <br /><br />one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930 .  this film is one of those ,  as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph ,  an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself ,  and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot .  peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_her .  truly a delight from start to finish ,  this is a silent that is definitely worth your while .  this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible . 
380 0 i always felt that a good film should have a plot .  this particular film was missing one ,  and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot .  this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; i was anxious for it to finally end .  however ,  i just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours .  not NOT_only NOT_was NOT_there NOT_no NOT_plot NOT_but NOT_the NOT_film NOT_also NOT_lacked NOT_a NOT_notable NOT_conflict .  it's not NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_movie NOT_i've NOT_seen ,  but i used to say that it was until i saw "the fast and the furious" .  so ,  don't NOT_think NOT_this NOT_review NOT_of NOT_mine NOT_is NOT_from NOT_someone NOT_who NOT_needs NOT_nothing NOT_but NOT_action .  i actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum .  not NOT_much NOT_really NOT_happens NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie .  however ,  the scenery and costumes were nice . 
381 1 i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal .  she couldn't dance for peanuts ,  she didn't NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_sing NOT_and NOT_as NOT_for NOT_her NOT_acting NOT_- NOT_she NOT_seemed NOT_in NOT_a NOT_trance .  but i hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful .  rather than kidding her own image ,  as has been suggested here ,  to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson ,  who did start off in slapstick comedies ,  went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a count .  marion ,  a top mimic ,  also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand ,  that was gloria swanson spot on!!!<br /><br />colonel pepper (dell henderson) has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood ,  determined to prove that his daughter ,  peggy ,  (marion davies) will be the greatest star ever .  their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone (william haines) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job .  peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic .  they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success .  charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesn't NOT_recognise NOT_him NOT_and NOT_treats NOT_him NOT_pretty NOT_rudely .  "who was that short little guy" - when she finds out she faints!!! peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way .  there is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't NOT_think NOT_much NOT_of NOT_- NOT_it's NOT_marion NOT_davies!!!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>she NOT_finally NOT_gets NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_of NOT_being NOT_a NOT_dramatic NOT_actress NOT_- NOT_but NOT_she NOT_can't NOT_cry!!!

383 1 back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didn't NOT_just NOT_listen NOT_to NOT_william NOT_randolph NOT_hearst ,  she'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier .  in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy ,  she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith .  <br /><br />what you're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies ,  a gifted comedienne ,  a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person .  she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire ,  she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardom . <br /><br />if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story .  i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story .  marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others ,  looking for that big break .  she wants to drama ,  but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics .  she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face ,  but learns her trade .  and also wins the heart of young comic actor william haines . <br /><br />she does get her first big break ,  but it doesn't NOT_come NOT_for NOT_haines NOT_as NOT_well NOT_and NOT_marion NOT_does NOT_get NOT_to NOT_do NOT_legitimate NOT_drama NOT_with NOT_actor NOT_paul NOT_ralli ,  playing andre telfair ,  a pretend no NOT_account NOT_count NOT_of NOT_avignon .  somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen ,  lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it ,  one of the most despised people in cinema . <br /><br />show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves .  you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin ,  douglas fairbanks ,  william s .  hart ,  mae murray ,  john gilbert ,  eleanor boardman etc .  ,  just being themselves in and around the film colony .  that in itself makes show people a film worth saving . <br /><br />show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like ,  ain't NOT_we NOT_got NOT_fun ,  i'm sitting on top of the world ,  you'd be surprised ,  california ,  here i come .  as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced ,  a song called crossroads was introduced in it .  it's not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_number ,  but no NOT_credit NOT_is NOT_given NOT_to NOT_the NOT_boy NOT_and NOT_girl NOT_singing NOT_it NOT_in NOT_the NOT_soundtrack .  i guess since they're not NOT_seen ,  it was felt no NOT_billing NOT_was NOT_necessary .  still i'd like to know and i'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show people . <br /><br />it's easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite .  she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience . 
384 0 the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery .  this movie was long and boring .  the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed .  how many times can his boys take the lord's name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background? it doesn't NOT_fit .  i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly ,  smirkish ,  selfish story of paul (brad pitt) .  so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what .  it's very uninteresting .  we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl .  that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western' .  what we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1 .  norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2 . paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies .  i'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never . 
385 1 prior to seeing show people ,  my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick ,  and slapstick only .  i could not NOT_imagine NOT_how NOT_screen NOT_comedy NOT_could NOT_be NOT_possible NOT_without NOT_relying NOT_heavily NOT_on NOT_spoken NOT_word NOT_or NOT_numerous NOT_pratfalls .  but this masterful film proved me wrong .  davies ,  in my view ,  was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball .  i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_ball's NOT_primary NOT_influences .  this is coming from a 21 year old who had never NOT_before NOT_seen NOT_silent NOT_comedy ,  and i must say that no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_much NOT_of NOT_the NOT_period-specific NOT_references NOT_you NOT_actually NOT_get NOT_(i NOT_didn't ,  apparently) ,  you will not NOT_be NOT_bored NOT_by NOT_this NOT_movie .  you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies .  this is not NOT_only NOT_my NOT_favorite NOT_silent NOT_comedy ,  but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time . 
386 0 the story by norman maclean is a masterwork; redford's film is a mediocrity .  he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not NOT_even NOT_hinted NOT_at NOT_in NOT_the NOT_story .  the cipher ,  brad pitt ,  trying to play the charismatic paul maclean ,  a genius outdoors ,  proves either risible or depressing ,  depending on what the original story meant to you .  some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful .  also ,  tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine ,  as men were once expected to be .  none of the women make an impression in the film ,  which is regrettable ,  because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear ,  even poetic . 
387 1 sunday july 16 ,  8:00pm the castro ,  san francisco<br /><br />"as a southern colonel your make-up is very indiana"<br /><br />the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years .  that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving ,  is often speculated .  considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into ,  this criticism would seem to have some validity .  as a comedienne however ,  her star shone very brightly .  left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand .  one of her better outings was king vidor's show people (1928) ,  which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos .  this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars ,  davies and that notorious joe college wise-cracker ,  william haines .  rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson ,  who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama (and don't NOT_think NOT_she NOT_didn't NOT_spend NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_her NOT_life NOT_reminding NOT_everyone!) NOT_with NOT_von NOT_stroheim ,  walsh and demille .  coincidentally ,  the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before (think of who worked there!) . <br /><br />colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper (dell henderson) drives his daughter peggy (davies) from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies .  these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone (haines) ,  " â– a custard pie artist â…" who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance (watch for the bit with the noodle) ,  and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture .  what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball ,  but a job is a job and billy convinces her "  .   .  all the stars have to take it on the chin â– " .  at the preview ,  billy and peggy bump into â… .  .  charlie chaplin ,  who asks for her autograph! she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign .  chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed ,  so naturally ,  she faints .  it's so very funny ,  considering davies character isn't NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_recognize NOT_this NOT_guy! NOT_peggy NOT_soon NOT_moves NOT_on NOT_to NOT_work NOT_at NOT_the NOT_high NOT_art NOT_studios ,  changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind .  davies does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress ,  with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips .  vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot (and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder ,  facing the camera!) that includes polly moran (who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid) ,  louella parsons (one of the friendly vampires) ,  estelle taylor ,  claire windsor aileen pringle ,  the comedy duo of karl dane (with his arm in a sling) and george k .  arthur (pretending he's stealing the silverware) ,  leatrice joy (amused by arthur's antics) ,  renee adoree ,  rod (eating and smoking) la rocque ,  mae murray ,  john (in a robe) gilbert (who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture) ,  norma (eeeww!) talmadge (looking bitchy and aloof as usual) and patricia dressed like marie antoinette ,  sandwiched between douglas fairbanks (as he does an amusing trick) and william s .  hart (protecting her from doug) .  billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming ,  with predictably nutty results .  vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production .  also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick ,  sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't NOT_get NOT_peggy NOT_to NOT_cry NOT_for NOT_her NOT_screen NOT_test NOT_and NOT_then NOT_can't NOT_stop NOT_her NOT_once NOT_she NOT_does ,  and paul ralli as andre ,  her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony .  when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it . <br /><br />while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence ,  it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm ,  irving thalberg ,  and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent .  what a shame so much has been lost .  there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy (1928) ,  vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year ,  languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed .

389 1 perhaps the funniest 'backstage at hollywood' movie ever ,  especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystone . <br /><br />marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role .  plenty of cameos for film buffs . 
390 0 slow and riddled with inaccuracy .  over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico .  james arness as jim bowie .  brian keith as davy crockett .  alec baldwin as col .  travis .  raul julia as general santa anna .  this made-for-tv project also stars david ogden stiers ,  kathleen york and jim metzler .  very good original music by peter bernstein . 
391 1 "show people" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines .  what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl ,  peggy pepper ,  whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen .  though she's a success in comedy ,  what she wants to do is make "art" so she moves up to high arts studio .  soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billy . <br /><br />many stars of the silent era have cameos in "show people , " including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup .  i'm sure when people saw the film in 1928 ,  they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly ,  nowadays ,  it's not NOT_the NOT_case ,  even for film buffs .  in one part of the film ,  however ,  she does meet charlie chaplin; in another ,  author elinor glyn is pointed out to her ,  and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film .  other stars who pop up in "show people" are john gilbert ,  douglas fairbanks ,  william s .  hart ,  leatrice joy ,  bess flowers ,  renee adoree ,  rod laroque ,  aileen pringle ,  and many others . <br /><br />davies was adorable and a lively comedienne .  it's a shame william haines quit the movies - he was cute and energetic ,  deservedly an enormous star back in the day . <br /><br />"show people" is a simple story told in a witty way .  it's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars . 
392 0 this movie is flawed on many fronts .  like many before it ,  it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history .  the production is poor ,  overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares .  this to me was the greatest flaw - i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never NOT_let NOT_any NOT_hint NOT_of NOT_believability NOT_intrude . <br /><br />as a native texan ,  i grew up with the mythology .  i later learned more about the history .  i can accept a decent production from either perspective (although i prefer more historical accuracy) ,  but this never NOT_gave NOT_me NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_enjoy NOT_it .  even john wayne's or fess parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess ,  while being only slightly less accurate . <br /><br />very disappointing - avoid it . 
393 1 this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies .  she is not NOT_only NOT_gorgeous NOT_but NOT_hilarious NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  (i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies' style ,  that could be termed "zany beauty" . ) vidor's direction is light but sure-handed ,  the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary ,  and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era ,  with many cameos ,  adds to the overall fun .  it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well .  for all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films ,  sit through this one and it may change your attitude .  <br /><br /> 
394 0 while being a great james arness western ,  this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made .  the story was terrible ,  inaccuracy all through it ,  and just downright untruths to boot! continuity was cast to the four winds .  anybody catch the cannon sequence? the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes .  come on! then there is brian keith's ridiculous hat! costumer must of been away or something .  or just out of their mind! 
395 1 "wisecracker , " the biography of actor william haines ,  offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies .  the old gent was not NOT_sentimental NOT_and NOT_rarely NOT_watched NOT_his NOT_own NOT_films ,  but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people ,  the late silent feature in which he co-starred with marion davies .  beforehand ,  haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter ,  but he was pleasantly surprised (and no NOT_doubt NOT_relieved) NOT_at NOT_how NOT_well NOT_it NOT_held NOT_up NOT_and NOT_how NOT_much NOT_the NOT_young NOT_audience NOT_enjoyed NOT_it .  watch the film today and you can see why: show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair ,  yet without malice .  it's still funny and its satirical points still resonate .  needless to say ,  the technology of movie-making has changed vastly since the silent days ,  but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much . <br /><br />show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies ,  a first-rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes .  where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour ,  the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst .  it's well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies' choice of roles ,  and well known too that ,  despite her gift for comedy ,  he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas .  by the late '20s ,  for whatever reason ,  marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including the red mill and the patsy) ,  but show people ,  directed by the great king vidor ,  stands as her most enjoyable showcase .  william haines gives an engaging ,  likable performance as her boyfriend and co-star billy boone ,  but this is the leading lady's show all the way . <br /><br />marion plays southern belle peggy pepper ,  an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father ,  determined to become a movie star .  (her dad colonel pepper is played by actor/director dell henderson ,  a veteran of griffith's biograph dramas whoâ—coincidentally?â—resembled hearst!) one of marion's funniest bits ,  often excerpted elsewhere ,  is her audition at the comet studio casting office .  while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray ("sorrow!  .   .   .  joy!") and drops a handkerchief across her face ,  peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture .  she's hired ,  only to discover that comet makes low-brow comedies ,  the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue .  of course ,  comet is intended as a take-off of mack sennett's keystone ,  but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds .  as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio ,  assuming the name "patricia peppoire" as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress .  at some point it may occur to us (as it surely did to viewers in 1928) that davies' rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b .  demille .  and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously ,  giving the high-hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone ,  davies' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself .  this is especially notable during an interview sequence ,  when miss peppoire's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot-on impersonation of swanson .  i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof ,  but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released . <br /><br />in any event ,  show people is a delicious treat for buffs ,  who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout .  charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit ,  sans makeup and looking quite distinguished ,  eagerly seeking patricia peppoire's autograph! (and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a self-mocking cameo appearance ,  evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself . ) this is a silent film that viewers not NOT_especially NOT_attuned NOT_to NOT_silents NOT_might NOT_appreciate ,  at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business .  show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin' in the rain ,  among hollywood's most expertly produced ,  enjoyable exercises in amused self-examination . 
396 0 burt kennedy used to be a very good director ,  but you'd never NOT_know NOT_it NOT_by NOT_this NOT_lumbering NOT_mess .  not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_this NOT_film NOT_look NOT_cheap ,  it is cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior "the last command" from 1955 ,  and that footage ,  shot 32 years previously ,  looks more contemporary than anything in this picture .  the few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized ,  confused and incompetent ,  looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture .  this has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_lot NOT_more) .  it moves like molasses ,  the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although raul julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies .  on top of that ,  it's way too long .  if you're going to make a boring film ,  do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours ,  like this one does .  if you want to see a good movie about the alamo ,  check out john wayne's 1960 version ,  or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes .  hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy .  skip it . 
397 1 oh it's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while! director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself .  the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you .  marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio .  she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world .  for a moment she even denies her (poor) past! the cameos are simply hilarious ,  certainly the scene where the main character (marion davies) sees .  .  . marion davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't NOT_seem NOT_that NOT_special .  .  .  it's got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then .  a must-see if you ask me!! 
398 0 this is a terrible movie ,  terrible script ,  bad direction and nonsensical ending .  also ,  bad performances ,  except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here ,  and michael pollard .  watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line . <br /><br />the movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related .  the part of the male lead is not NOT_well NOT_written NOT_and NOT_seems NOT_uncharismatic NOT_in NOT_this NOT_role .  you can see the plot points a mile away .  the actions of the female lead and that of her brother ,  the cop ,  also make no NOT_sense .  so ,  a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no NOT_sense NOT_script-wise . 
399 1 i've seen hundreds of silent movies .  some will always be classics (such as nosferatu ,  metropolis ,  the general and wings) but among them ,  my favorite is this film (it may not NOT_be NOT_the NOT_best--but NOT_a NOT_favorite ,  yes) .  in fact ,  when i looked it up on imdb ,  i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made .  marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not NOT_just NOT_william NOT_randolph NOT_hearst's NOT_mistress . <br /><br />the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star! her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see! 
400 0 that reviewers liked this movie surprises me .  the plot is a muddle .  the characters are wooden .  michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them .  no NOT_one NOT_has NOT_any NOT_redeeming NOT_quality NOT_or NOT_point-of-interest .  this is not NOT_an NOT_edgy NOT_work .  it is not NOT_imaginative .  it is not NOT_ironic .  it is no NOT_clever .  there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work .  that is missed theatrical release is not NOT_surprise .  that the "this network" airs it diminishes that venue .  i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television .  if you encounter it on daytime television ,  take a long walk .  even if you walk in smog ,  you will feel better not NOT_having NOT_suffered NOT_through NOT_this NOT_shambles .  life is short .  this movie is long . 
401 1 updated from a previous comment .  the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines .  davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines ,  a bit player in crude comedies .  they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star . <br /><br />a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions .  davies & haines are a wonderful team ,  and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin ,  douglas fairbanks ,  william s .  hart ,  john gilbert ,  elinor glyn ,  norma talmadge ,  mae murray ,  rod larocque ,  leatrice joy ,  dorothy sebastian ,  estelle taylor ,  louella parsons ,  renee adoree ,  aileen pringle ,  and marion davies (you have to see it) are a hoot .  a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies! dell henderson plays the father .  polly moran is a maid .  paul ralli is the slimy leading man . <br /><br />show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model (i think mae murray is closer) .  davies and swanson were friends .  but this film's story does parallel the rise of swanson from one-reel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b .  demille films of the late teens and early 20s . <br /><br />davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends .  odd that mgm never NOT_teamed NOT_them NOT_up NOT_in NOT_a NOT_talkie .  they're great together! a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood .  greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not NOT_appear . 
402 0 iberia is nice to see on tv .  but why see this in silver screen? lot of dance and music .  if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie .  but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time .  if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see bollywood movie .  they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie .  director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience .  and time to time it's look really good .  but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting .  there are many kind of art not NOT_everything NOT_is NOT_bigger NOT_then NOT_life NOT_and NOT_this NOT_film NOT_is NOT_not NOT_too NOT_big .

404 0 that's not NOT_the NOT_sound NOT_of NOT_bees ,  that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long ,  extremely boring ,  badly acted movie .  how i ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep i'll never NOT_know .  the plot is simple .  .  . 3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours .  and you thought rohmer was deadly .  this is even worse ,  if that's possible .  > i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off .  .  . or killing someone . 
405 1 a give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10 .  two of the best actors of their time-walter matthau & george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director herbert ross ,  and all of that makes this stage adaption come true .  the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70's .  i love the type of humor in this film ,  it just makes me laugh so hard . <br /><br />i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago (yes ,  vhs because it was cheaper-only $3) .  i watched it as soon as i got home ,  but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time .  the second time i watched it ,  it felt a lot better ,  and i laughed a lot harder .  i'm definitely going to re-get this on dvd because i have to see the special features . <br /><br />it's very funny how that happens .  two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers .  they get along well on stage ,  but really argue off stage ,  they can't NOT_survive NOT_another NOT_minute NOT_with NOT_each NOT_other ,  then some 15 years later ,  you want to reunite them for a tv special .  you can find that in this film .  matthau & burns were terrific in this film .  it's a damn shame they died .  george burns deserved that oscar .  he gave a strong comic performance .  he was also 78 when this movie was filmed .  so far ,  he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age .  jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress .  richard benjamin was also fantastic in this .  he won a golden globe for best supporting actor .  he deserved that golden globe .  although many people might disagree with what i am about to say ,  everybody in this film gave a strong performance .  this comedy is an instant classic .  i highly recommend it .  one more thing: whoever hates this film is a "putz"

"la maman et la putain" has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no NOT_one NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_the NOT_history NOT_of NOT_film ,  certainly ,  should be dissuaded from watching it .  to express a purely subjective judgement ,  however ,  i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people: "don't watch it; it's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry . " and by that i don't NOT_mean NOT_"sick NOT_and NOT_angry" NOT_about NOT_"the NOT_human NOT_condition" NOT_or NOT_anything NOT_so NOT_general NOT_and NOT_profound NOT_as NOT_that ,  because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film - "an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty" and so on - and ,  if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort ,  then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself ,  however pessimistic his conclusions may be .  my beef with the film is rather that i don't NOT_see NOT_this NOT_hours-long NOT_record NOT_of NOT_empty NOT_vanity NOT_and NOT_petty NOT_treachery NOT_as NOT_being NOT_justified NOT_or NOT_excused NOT_by NOT_any NOT_generally NOT_relevant NOT_message NOT_at NOT_all .  all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals: alexandre to the greatest degree ,  of course ,  because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds; marie perhaps to the least degree ,  because we see the least of her .  alexandre's affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value ,  of course ,  but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean-pierre lã©aud is most likely not NOT_even NOT_acting NOT_and NOT_that ,  with absurd remarks like "un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray" ,  he really was just reproducing word-for-word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he ,  along with the director eustache ,  had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film .  i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100% of the film ,  it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow ,  worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu .  what made ,  however ,  this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us .  if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman ,  sleeping (mostly in this very flat) with another ,  and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third ,  well ,  i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog-eat-dog world he's chosen to create for himself .  what i can't ,  however ,  in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his "anxiety" and his "despair" .  the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika ,  whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty .  as i say ,  if "la maman et la putain" is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre ,  veronika and marie ,  three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never NOT_admit NOT_into NOT_their NOT_company NOT_let NOT_alone NOT_their NOT_home ,  then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being "unflinching" (though why one should even feel like "flinching" once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can't NOT_imagine) .  the problem ,  however ,  is that the director is clearly convinced - and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics - that alexander ,  veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities .  this latter idea ,  however ,  is arrant and offensive nonsense .  there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular .  but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work .  it surely needs no NOT_cinematic NOT_or NOT_authorial NOT_genius NOT_to NOT_convey NOT_to NOT_us NOT_the NOT_information NOT_that NOT_a NOT_man NOT_who NOT_behaves NOT_like NOT_alexandre NOT_is NOT_going NOT_to NOT_end NOT_up NOT_hated ,  miserable ,  and alone ,  or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter .  watch "la maman et la putain" if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post-'68 parisian milieu which was probably ,  unfortunately ,  not NOT_restricted NOT_to NOT_just NOT_a NOT_few NOT_particularly NOT_anti-social NOT_types NOT_like NOT_these .  but please don't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_mistake NOT_of NOT_believing NOT_that NOT_what NOT_is NOT_recorded NOT_here NOT_has NOT_any NOT_general NOT_relevance NOT_for NOT_humanity NOT_in NOT_the NOT_way NOT_that NOT_a NOT_film NOT_by NOT_jean NOT_renoir NOT_or NOT_martin NOT_scorsese NOT_might NOT_be NOT_argued NOT_to NOT_have . 
407 1 the neil simon's sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness ,  but the laughter always bitter taste .  seeing willy clark(matthau) and al lewis(burns) two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue .  willy not NOT_ever NOT_surrender NOT_and NOT_continue NOT_to NOT_look NOT_work ,  while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter .  the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony ,  but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel ,  and for eleven years after their broken they not NOT_talk NOT_between .  now if they would work ,  they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show .  the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questionsâ… .  the neil simon's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthu(nomination academy award as best actor) and george burns(won the academy award as best support actor) .  the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not NOT_bear NOT_between NOT_them .  the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report love-heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life .  my rate is 7 . 
408 0 the perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by mary ellen trainor ,  once the wife to director robert zemeckis ,  who helmed this episode) ,  who murders her husband with a poker ,  has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside .  . an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit(played by a deviously hideous larry drake) .  she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse .  she decides to use an ax ,  once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head ,  to frame the killer for her husband's murder .  santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child . <br /><br />this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old "santa kills" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine .  it's essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac .  there's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions .  not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_show's NOT_highlights . 
409 1 first off ,  i dislike almost all neil simon movies .  but there is something about this that is unique ,  that draws me in ,  and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen .  the second time i watched it ,  the connection was clear .  when did neil simon meet my grandmothers? <br /><br />ah ,  afraid they might sue ,  so he changed them into men .  and how dull would it be if they were only housewives ,  show biz stars is more fun .  well this is a personal review ,  and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived walter matthau's magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters . <br /><br />secondly ,  i have little tolerance for george burns ,  but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it ,  although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character) . <br /><br />very ethnic in flavor ,  and over the top ,  you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off .  for me ,  the pleasure lingers . 
410 0 i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted ,  remembering rahs and raves for it .  but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary ,  it backed off and went somewhere else .  the dripping water throughout the house ,  the black rain ,  the prophetic dreams ,  taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream . <br /><br />what a disappointment .  chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief ,  something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on .  what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head .  the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods ,  that the aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests ,  and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the dream time) . <br /><br />[spoiler] in the final scene ,  it wasn't NOT_clear NOT_to NOT_me NOT_what NOT_the NOT_director NOT_was NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_tell .  is there a big wave? so what? how big? a tsunami? yeah ,  okay .  that's devastating but not NOT_apocalyptic .  is it the end of the world? from a wave? the last wave? that'd have to be a pretty darn big wave .  why? was the world that bad a place? it didn't NOT_seem NOT_so NOT_awful NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie .  actually i didn't NOT_think NOT_the NOT_wave NOT_came NOT_off ,  since the shadow left burton's face that had been cast by the wave .  was it only burton's apocalypse? heck ,  that happens every day to people who lose it .  it wasn't NOT_of NOT_any NOT_interest NOT_if NOT_it NOT_was NOT_only NOT_him . <br /><br />the most frightening scene ,  and the one that gives the best indication of weir's potential ,  was in charlie's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton's wife .  charlie keeps asking him "who are you?" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while .  unfortunately ,  the movie never NOT_followed NOT_suit . 
411 1 first ,  an explanation: despite my headline ,  i'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_best NOT_films NOT_ever NOT_made .  all the criticisms registered here have valid points .  also ,  be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter .  he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue -- especially dry ,  jewish ,  love-suffused sarcasm -- and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love ,  then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie . <br /><br />so much for warnings .  here's my main point: walter matthau is flat-out perfect ,  even beyond perfect ,  in this movie .  i have never NOT_seen NOT_him NOT_funnier ,  or more touching for that matter -- because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star self-image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline ,  he also shows us the more vulnerable ,  maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch .  and he only barely shows us that sad part -- it's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father's or husband's mental decline right now (i mention this as a warning) ,  but artistically ,  it's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots i'm seen in possibly any film performance .  this is beyond method acting -- matthau's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery .  this is a masterpiece of comic acting . <br /><br />about richard benjamin: i personally find his acting annoying in general ,  and his work in this movie is no NOT_exception NOT_-- NOT_although NOT_he NOT_has NOT_some NOT_fine NOT_moments NOT_here .  ("chicken is funny .  .  .  . " is one of them . ) so if you like him ,  you should like him here ,  and if you don't NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_won't NOT_change NOT_your NOT_mind . <br /><br />about the 1976 oscars .  .  . i agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in "cuckoo's nest" that year .  it was a killer year for leading-actor competition; if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama ,  then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for "dog day afternoon" and to walter matthau for "the sunshine boys" -- not NOT_to NOT_dis NOT_jack's NOT_fine NOT_work NOT_as NOT_mcmurphy ,  but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year .  also ,  i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance -- i mean ,  he was good in this movie ,  but not NOT_that NOT_good .  (burns's fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return to show biz beat brad dourif's truly brilliant debut in "cuckoo's nest , " not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_chris NOT_sarandon's NOT_stunning NOT_debut NOT_in NOT_"dog NOT_day NOT_afternoon" NOT_-- NOT_which NOT_i NOT_think NOT_proves NOT_my NOT_theory . ) <br /><br />oscar theories aside ,  here's my bottom line review: if you like matthau's comic acting ,  then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures ,  fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides .  (but if you're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip ,  then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now . ) 
412 0 i gave this film 2 stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting .  everything else about this film is extremely amateur .  everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed .  not NOT_only NOT_should NOT_the NOT_director NOT_rethink NOT_what NOT_she NOT_is NOT_doing NOT_for NOT_a NOT_life NOT_career NOT_but NOT_maybe NOT_she NOT_should NOT_watch NOT_a NOT_few NOT_films .  as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor ,  placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful .  whomever the "actor" was that played jack's best friend should never NOT_have NOT_stepped NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_the NOT_camera .  i didn't NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_from NOT_such NOT_a NOT_small NOT_film ,  but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings .  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_or NOT_money NOT_on NOT_this NOT_film NOT_(like NOT_i NOT_did) NOT_you NOT_will NOT_be NOT_sorely NOT_disappointed . 
413 1 i'm 14 ,  so you probably would think i have never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_george NOT_burns NOT_or NOT_walter NOT_matthau NOT_or NOT_anyone NOT_like NOT_that .  boy are you wrong .  i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it .  i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten .  i saw the movie oh ,  god recently and loved it .  this one was also very awesome .  george burns did a great job .  so did walter matthau(this is the first time i've ever seen him perform) .  and even though they had really small roles ,  phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job .  that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done .  let me say this ,  if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau ,  you should see this movie right away! 
414 0 this movie is a 90 minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom .  what kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />unless you are a major ramones fan ,  do not NOT_and NOT_i NOT_repeat NOT_do NOT_not NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_like NOT_i NOT_did .  this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish .  this movie should be called ramone fever .  everyone appears to like them in this movie .  there is not NOT_a NOT_plot NOT_to NOT_be NOT_found NOT_in NOT_this NOT_flick .  as far as teen comedies go ,  you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one . 
415 1 at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple ,  but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film .  basically forgetful ex-comedians willy clark (golden globe winner ,  and oscar and bafta nominated walter matthau) and al lewis (oscar winning ,  and golden glove nominated george burns) were a great comedy duo ,  and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show .  willy's nephew ,  ben clark (golden globe winning richard benjamin) is confident they can get together again with no NOT_hard NOT_feelings NOT_for NOT_each NOT_other ,  how wrong he is .  they cannot get on all the time ,  they are both forgetful ,  especially during conversation ,  but they do it eventually .  also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch (miss mcintosh) ,  carol deluise as mrs .  doris green ,  al's daughter ,  rosetta lenoire as odessa ,  willy's nurse and muppets from space's f .  murray abraham as mechanic .  i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him "a son of a bitch bastard" .  it was nominated the oscars for best art direction-set decoration and best writing ,  screenplay adapted from other material ,  it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay ,  and it won the golden globe best motion picture - musical/comedy ,  and it was nominated for best screenplay .  very good! 
416 0 horrible film with bits of the ramones strewn about .  your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan .  this movie is terrible .  the plot consists of a girl who enjoys the ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration .  forget this movie and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf if you want an entertaining b movie .  terrible acting ,  terrible writing ,  terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie .  that is the only logical thing i can think of because this movie blows . 
417 1 the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each other . <br /><br />the comic genius of two masters at work ,  george burns and walter matthau are stellar! some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things! the material is fast-paced and witty ,  appealing to all ages . <br /><br />mild spoiler alert: there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft ,  sincere ,  tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success ,  are each other . <br /><br />if anyone loves the odd couple ,  you'll adore this movie .  an excellent film! 
418 0 i could never NOT_stand NOT_watching NOT_happy NOT_days NOT_after NOT_chachi NOT_joined NOT_the NOT_cast ,  so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio (a skateboard chase scene!) .  jodie foster in her first "grown-up" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no NOT_excuse NOT_for NOT_this NOT_boring NOT_mess .  two hours out of my life that i'll never NOT_get NOT_back! NOT_no NOT_noteworthy NOT_characters ,  unbelievable storyline ,  questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all ,  i couldn't have cared less .  the story of california teens in the 1970's ,  where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots .  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_ugly NOT_excuse NOT_for NOT_a NOT_movie . 
419 1 walter matthau and george burns just work so well together .  the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven .  the scene when they meet again in willy's flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection .  walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can ,  the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization .  george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film ,  his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable .  watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker ,  and al's reaction - priceless . 
420 0 maybe you shouldn't compare ,  but wild style and style wars are original hip hop .  beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop ,  but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break ,  of course for some it was and that's nice .  but if you view this as original hip hop culture you're wrong .  it's overproduced and has a hollywood sauce .  rather look for the first two movies i mentioned .  they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto .  yes ,  the rating for this movie is low ,  but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving .  this is probably because although the story ,  the acting ,  the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful ,  the music and dancing is what the people love about it .  me ,  i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared ,  like krs one ,  public enemy ,  ultramagnetic mc's ,  jungle brothers ,  bizmarkie to name a few) ,  and i still don't NOT_like NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_beats NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_that NOT_is NOT_why NOT_it NOT_doesn't NOT_work NOT_for NOT_me .  i mean ,  wild style has not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_story NOT_but NOT_the NOT_music NOT_there NOT_is NOT_great NOT_and NOT_authentic .  of course tastes differ and that's alright .  but as far as i'm concerned ,  this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't NOT_rate NOT_it NOT_higher NOT_than NOT_a NOT_4 NOT_out NOT_of NOT_ten . 
421 1 two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit play . <br /><br />great combination ,  especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns .  small wonder why burns won an oscar for this; he's as sharp and as funny as ever .  and matthau is every bit his match ,  if a tad more crotchety . <br /><br />this is familiar simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still can't NOT_stand NOT_one NOT_another NOT_after NOT_all NOT_these NOT_years . <br /><br />it's a delight to watch these two pick at each other ,  their scenes together make this film an absolute delight .  myself ,  i especially enjoyed the "knock ,  knock ,  knock / enter!" scene .  and if you're a fan of either burns or matthau ,  you'll enjoy it ,  too . <br /><br />in fact ,  you'll enjoy the whole movie .  <br /><br />ten stars .  put a little "sunshine" in your life . 
422 0 hilariously obvious "drama" about a bunch of high school (i think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop ,  break dancing ,  graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxy--or something .  to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot! even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally .  we're supposed to find this kids likable and nice .  i found them bland and boring .  the one that i really hated was ramon .  he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great .  excuse me? he's defacing public property that isn't NOT_his NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with .  also these "great" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building .  uh huh .  so we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun . <br /><br />i could forgive all that if the music was good but i can't NOT_stand NOT_hip NOT_hop .  the songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! they're always playing! it got to the point that i was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers .  (cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) there are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight ,  a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show .  if you love hip hop here's your movie .  but it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it .  also how did this get a pg rating? there's an incredible amount of swearing in this . 
423 1 as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age ,  this film is without parallel .  it is ,  quite simply ,  brilliant .  full marks to everyone - from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product .  you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers . 
424 0 closer to reality and containing more depth than "breakdance" ,  stan lathan's "beat street" is still a pretty dull show .  again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot ,  which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother ,  all growing up in queens ,  new york .  each has their own unique talent .  one is a hustler ,  one a d . j .  ,  another an artist who creates 'burners' ,  while little bro' lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer . <br /><br />lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though ,  and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters .  therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day . <br /><br />choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes ,  but this alone is not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_lift NOT_""beat NOT_street" NOT_to NOT_greater NOT_heights .  unfortunately the film really falls flat late on ,  after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting . <br /><br />sunday ,  august 25 ,  1996 - video 
425 1 much like the comedy duo of its title ,  "the sunshine boys" has become a forgotten classic 30-odd years later .  it's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s .  this makes no NOT_sense NOT_given NOT_the NOT_singular NOT_specialness NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film ,  perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote . <br /><br />walter matthau plays willy clark ,  once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark ,  now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who can't NOT_get NOT_a NOT_job NOT_in NOT_a NOT_potato NOT_chip NOT_commercial .  his nephew and agent ben (richard benjamin) is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis (george burns) for an abc-tv celebration of show business nostalgia . <br /><br />nostalgia is what "sunshine boys" has going for it in spades ,  right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter's "be a clown" .  then there's the film's present-day setting in manhattan ,  where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound .  the periods collide in willy's glorious mess of a manhattan apartment ,  where framed photos and cartoons of long-dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags .  if you were alive in the 1970s like me ,  you might even feel like you were in that apartment . <br /><br />willy clearly has been living there too long .  he's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils .  willy wakes up and picks up the phone . <br /><br />"hello ,  who is this?" a pause .  "never mind ,  it's the tea . "<br /><br />old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else's hands ,  but simon's deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold .  the amazing thing about "the sunshine boys" is how much it rubs your noses in willy's almost existential condition without turning you off at all .  "89 years old and just like that ,  he dies of nothing'" willy says of one old songwriting friend ,  before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed "lady" with "baby" . <br /><br />burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis ,  but it's matthau who brings this one home ,  his make-up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this .  willy is obnoxious in the extreme ,  fully deserving ben's description "crazy freakin' old man" ,  but you root for him throughout ,  enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience .  his lines kill you ,  too ,  especially when he's trying to kill lewis ,  for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea . <br /><br />"you're out of touch!" willy tells lewis at one point .  "i'm still in demand .  i'm still hot!"<br /><br />"if this room was on fire you wouldn't NOT_be NOT_hot , " lewis replies . <br /><br />director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way ,  with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance .  you never NOT_get NOT_the NOT_feeling NOT_you NOT_are NOT_watching NOT_a NOT_movie ,  one of "the sunshine boys" many charms ,  and ross's direction ,  like the acting of the three principals ,  goes a long way toward achieving that end . <br /><br />comedy is hard ,  especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by ,  but "the sunshine boys" makes it all seem a pleasure ,  because ,  for us watching ,  it is . 
426 0 yes ,  indeed ,  it could have been a good movie .  a love biangle ,  (sorry for the poetical license ,  but is not NOT_a NOT_triangle!) NOT_an NOT_interesting NOT_story ,  unfortunately badly told .  the image is sometimes weird ,  sometimes ok ,  the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted .  the sound needs more attention (it usually does in romanian movies) ,  the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen .  the soundtrack is short and is not NOT_helping NOT_the NOT_action .  about the acting .  .  .  sorry but the best actress is the landlady .  the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer .  the acting is poetical when it should be realistic ,  and realistic when it should be poetical .  it's a picture for adults ,  told by the children .  bother only if extremely curious . 
427 1 walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act ,  lewis and clark ,  who haven't spoken in over 10 years .  burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since .  such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie .  of course ,  what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime ,  and the material is funnier than anything you can find today .  richard benjamin shines as matthau's nephew and agent .  there's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film ,  and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a "pop . " rosetta lanoire ,  who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on "family matters , " is great in a small role . <br /><br />the only problem i had with it (and maybe i'm being too picky and/or serious) is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet .  granted ,  he's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years ,  but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context .  also ,  i'm used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies ,  but not NOT_to NOT_george NOT_burns .  and ,  matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old .  <br /><br />all in all ,  if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles ,  put in "the sunshine boys . " they'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life . <br /><br />benjamin: "you have to slide it . " <br /><br />matthau: "wait ,  wait .  i think you have to slide it . " 
428 0 considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign ,  i would have expected something to be worth the fuzz .  .  . from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers "sensually" caress each other ,  laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards .  .  . nothing to get the attention ,  not NOT_a NOT_mind-catching NOT_thing NOT_in NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_plot ,  baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions ,  but artificiality is at its best) .  incest and lesbianism are promising themes ,  but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers ,  saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious ,  unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing .  .  . ) .  the too curious viewers will not NOT_get NOT_any NOT_interesting NOT_scene .  .  . at this point ,  that could have saved some of the movie .  .  . so you can imagine how bad it is .  many other things could be said .  .  . but please watch the movie yourselves .  .  . i am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives .  .  . like i did :( 
429 1 an old vaudeville team of willy clark (walter matthau) and al lewis (george burns) were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other .  over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv special .  .  . but find out they still hate each other .  willy's nephew/agent (richard benjamin) tries to get them to work together . <br /><br />a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor .  i (somewhat) liked it .  it was written by neil simon so its non-stop one-liners .  some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and al's senility was not .  also i never NOT_liked NOT_matthau .  i never NOT_thought NOT_he NOT_was NOT_a NOT_good NOT_actor NOT_and NOT_something NOT_about NOT_him NOT_just NOT_rubbed NOT_me NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_way .  also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly .  all that aside this was fun .  burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even matthau was good matching him .  their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie .  also benjamin is very good as willy's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other .  for me it's worth seeing for burns alone .  this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with "oh god" .  so ,  this is good .  just good--not great .  matthau's character really makes this hard to love .  i give it a 7 .

431 1 the word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays ,  but this movie well deserves the appelation .  the combination of neil simon ,  walter matthau (possibly the world's best living comic actor) ,  and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece .  it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not NOT_death NOT_prevented NOT_jack NOT_benny NOT_from NOT_playing NOT_george NOT_burns' NOT_part ,  as had been planned .  as it is ,  the reunion scene in matthau's apartment is not NOT_likely NOT_to NOT_be NOT_surpassed NOT_as NOT_a NOT_sidesplitter .  definitely one of my desert island films . <br /><br />"enter!!!!!!!!!"

433 1 question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full ,  furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode? answer: quietly ,  deadpan ,  and with perfect timing as george burns does here . <br /><br />i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film ,  the two leads are hilarious ,  the script funny ,  the direction and pacing very fine .  richard benjamin is very funny as straight man - trying to get at burns through the window etc .  even the small parts are great . <br /><br />there are so many funny scenes ,  mathau messing up the commercial ,  burns repeating his answers as if senile .  .  . <br /><br />a delight . <br /><br />enterrrrrr! 
434 0 this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed . that is it . the dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent . the acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children , yet the subject is intended for adult audiences .  it is a gutless and shallow movie . it could have been way better if it had a story and more drama .  ah and on top of that ,  one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? makes it seem so cheap . all in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it . i know the means are scarce but ,  that is not NOT_always NOT_an NOT_excuse NOT_for NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_flopping NOT_as NOT_this NOT_one NOT_does . and please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (tudor chirila) - they can't NOT_act! 
435 1 the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team ,  played by walter matthau and george burns ,  who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that .  the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other .  richard benjamin appears as matthau's nephew ,  a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality .  this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment .  .  . vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau ,  burns ,  and benjamin .  burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this ,  but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark .  matthau was nominated for best actor but didn't NOT_stand NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_against NOT_nicholson NOT_for NOT_one NOT_flew NOT_over NOT_the NOT_cuckoo's NOT_nest; NOT_however ,  in another year ,  this was an oscar-worthy performance .  matthau commands the screen and there is not NOT_a NOT_false NOT_note NOT_in NOT_this NOT_beautifully NOT_timed NOT_performance .  the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_name NOT_of NOT_the NOT_product NOT_right NOT_is NOT_a NOT_classic .  the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns . 
436 0 ***light spoiler alert*** the story sounds good and if you've read the novel ,  then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships . <br /><br />true enough ,  the script tries to do that ,  the director tries to do that ,  but the main cast fails miserably .  maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever ,  her most intense moments seem almost comical .  sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera .  her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend . <br /><br />ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse ,  she doesn't NOT_seem NOT_natural NOT_at NOT_all .  maria had the attitude ,  even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious ,  but she had it and her character received some credibility .  and to make matters worse ,  we don't NOT_have NOT_an NOT_insight NOT_on NOT_her: NOT_where NOT_does NOT_she NOT_come NOT_from ,  how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship ,  how did the relationship evolve? we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end ,  but no NOT_beginning .  just like her partner maria ,  she has only once scene that is truly touching ,  the scene where she dumps maria's character kiki . <br /><br />tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady ,  great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent .  he has his character's attitude and it fits him .  only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal ,  he tries to be obvious when it wasn't NOT_necessary NOT_at NOT_all) . <br /><br />i love the story ,  tudor chirila is ok there ,  the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style ,  but this doesn't NOT_save NOT_the NOT_movie .  too bad ,  the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme . <br /><br />oddly enough ,  the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well ,  maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of maria and ioana .  i'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket ,  i'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room . 
437 1 taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway ,  walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics ,  a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on life . <br /><br />walter matthau can't NOT_stop NOT_working ,  the man has never NOT_learned NOT_to NOT_relax ,  take some time and smell the roses .  he's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him .  <br /><br />what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family .  a workaholic like matthau can't NOT_comprehend NOT_it NOT_and NOT_take NOT_burns's NOT_decision NOT_personally . <br /><br />benjamin hits on a brain storm ,  reunite the guys and do it on a national television special .  what happens here is pretty hilarious . <br /><br />the sunshine boys is also a sad ,  bittersweet story as well about old age .  matthau is on screen for most of the film ,  but it's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79 . <br /><br />burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well .  as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burns&allen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from .  in 1958 due to health reasons ,  gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 .  or at least pretty close to as an active performer . <br /><br />the sunshine boys is based on the team of smith&dale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century .  the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their material . <br /><br />and i do think you will like the sunshine boys . 
438 0 it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie .  .  . it is quite predictable not NOT_mentioning NOT_that NOT_the NOT_two NOT_girls NOT_resemble NOT_the NOT_russian NOT_group NOT_t . a . t . u .  .  .  . coincidence? i don't NOT_think NOT_so .  there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous . you know the recipe .  the other actors .  .  . well , i just don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_their NOT_role NOT_is NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be .  most of them are well - known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not NOT_even NOT_actors(e . g . mihaela radulescu) . so to summarize it: "girl band tatty"+desperate/publicity needing "actors"+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= love sick .  .  .  . too bad .  .  . the idea was good , though .  .  . and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title .  .  . 
439 1 simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns .  you can literally hear the script crackle .  there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script .  for example ,  the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less-quality actors involved .  matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark (of course ,  oscar moreso in the odd couple) ,  and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character (the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is "out of touch" is the quintessential example of this) make this one of the best performances i've ever seen of any actor in any role ,  be it comedic or drama or whatever else .  period .  matthau and burns work excellently together; the contrast they portray accentuates simon's superb knack at creating comedic conflict .  this movie is simply one of the ultimate "must-sees" and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history . 
440 0 "the crush" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so ,  as it tries to be a brit "sex and the city" .  <br /><br />i particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not NOT_much NOT_fleshed NOT_out NOT_(come NOT_to NOT_think NOT_of NOT_it NOT_we NOT_didn't NOT_see NOT_all NOT_that NOT_much NOT_physical NOT_flesh NOT_of NOT_him NOT_either NOT_and NOT_kenny NOT_doughty NOT_is NOT_worth NOT_seeing NOT_more NOT_of) .  <br /><br />they sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of "sabrina" (neither movie do i like) or for that matter with the douglas/zeta-jones or dion/svengali nuptials . <br /><br />surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies ,  such as tart-tongued anna chancellor .  <br /><br />the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina .  but it wasn't NOT_until NOT_the NOT_credits NOT_came NOT_up NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_that NOT_i NOT_realized NOT_what NOT_might NOT_really NOT_be NOT_wrong .  just as with "sex and the city , " the writer/director is male ,  here first-timer scot john mckay ,  and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men ,  probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal ,  a cop and a doctor) ,  which would have been a better and more interesting movie .  the working title for the film was "the sad f*cker's club" which would have made its parallels with the gay "broken hearts club" even more obvious . <br /><br />(originally written 4/6/2002) 
441 1 neil simon's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays .  felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original ,  the former being picky and neat ,  the latter being slovenly and loose .  simon would rewrite (less successfully) the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple ,  with female roommates .  he made it a mixed couple (a woman with her daughter ,  and a man) in the goodbye girls .  he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys ,  a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark ,  the aged ,  semi-retired vaudevillians .  here the "apartment" problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can't NOT_stand NOT_each NOT_other .  the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie ,  and george burns as al . <br /><br />in actuality ,  al probably does not NOT_think NOT_totally NOT_badly NOT_of NOT_willie NOT_- NOT_willie NOT_is NOT_pathological NOT_on NOT_the NOT_subject NOT_of NOT_al .  first al had little habits ,  such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter "t" ,  and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger ,  on stage .  secondly ,  al retired when his wife died .  willie was not NOT_ready NOT_to NOT_retire NOT_(and NOT_has NOT_been NOT_forcing NOT_his NOT_nephew NOT_and NOT_agent ,  ben (richard benjamin) to try to get him jobs in commercials .  but willie can't NOT_remember NOT_lines NOT_unless NOT_they NOT_are NOT_funny ,  and keeps flubbing them .  so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial . <br /><br />ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy .  he does bring al to see willie ,  and the sparks begin flying ,  as neither can figure out what the other is doing (and this is just in rehearsal .  on top of that ,  willie is insisting on changes (minor ones ,  but they throw off al) such as saying "enter!!!" when al knocks on the door .  the initial rehearsal is a failure ,  but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show .  the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al's neck?<br /><br />the three leads ,  matthau ,  burns ,  and benjamin ,  do very well with the one-liners ,  frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter (example: "chest pains .  .  . i'm getting chest pains uncle willie .  every thursday i come here and get chest pains!" "so ,  come on fridays!") .  benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle ,  although matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult (he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville) .  matthau has a little better grasp on reality (at first) than burns ,  who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly .  burns is not NOT_senile NOT_- NOT_he NOT_takes NOT_things NOT_slowly .  but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement . <br /><br />i call this a final "voyage of discovery" for our modern lewis and clark .  al and willie transcend their old skits ,  as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought .  even the irascible willie admits that al may be (to him) a pain in the ass ,  but he was a funny man . <br /><br />burns was not NOT_the NOT_original NOT_choice NOT_for NOT_the NOT_part NOT_of NOT_"al NOT_lewis" NOT_(supposedly NOT_dale NOT_of NOT_the NOT_team NOT_smith NOT_and NOT_dale) .  jack benny was .  benny probably would have done a good job ,  but ill-health forced him out (he died in 1975) .  burns (whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator) turned in such a fine performance that he got the "oscar" for best supporting actor ,  and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god!; oh god ,  you devil; and going in style .  he died in 1996 age 100 ,  having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan . 
442 0 i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise ,  the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man . <br /><br />intriguing . <br /><br />not! i hasten to add .  these women are all drawn in extreme caricature ,  not NOT_very NOT_supportive NOT_of NOT_one NOT_another NOT_and NOT_conspiring NOT_and NOT_contriving NOT_to NOT_bring NOT_each NOT_other NOT_down . <br /><br />anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no NOT_wrong NOT_in NOT_my NOT_book NOT_prior NOT_to NOT_seeing NOT_this ,  but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball ,  which doesn't NOT_work NOT_too NOT_well NOT_when NOT_the NOT_women NOT_are NOT_all NOT_well NOT_known NOT_professionals NOT_in NOT_a NOT_very NOT_small NOT_town . <br /><br />and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives .  i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension ,  the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby ,  gimme a cigarette! right . <br /><br />like i said ,  a shame of a waste .  4 out of 10 . 
443 1 i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out .  i didn't NOT_really NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_humor NOT_back NOT_then ,  but this movie can make me laugh out loud . <br /><br />with all due respect to george burns (rip) ,  walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film .  his performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character ,  willie clark .  his mannerisms are first-rate .  ("you know what kind of songs he wrote? sh*t!" and when speaking to the spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: "no! no! no NOT_enchilada!!")

444 0 as a single woman over 40 ,  i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40 ,  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_every NOT_other NOT_woman ,  of any age .  it was a sad ,  pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a "chick flick" ,  and it failed miserably .  andy mcdowell isn't NOT_much NOT_of NOT_an NOT_actress NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with ,  but given the non-existent "plot" (i hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this ,  she didn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_chance .  there was no NOT_character NOT_development ,  no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_feel NOT_sympathy/empathy NOT_for NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters ,  and no NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_film NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way NOT_realistic NOT_or NOT_believable .  and then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- please . <br /><br />not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental ,  i also want those 112 minutes of my life back .  what a ripoff . 
445 1 a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end .  the late walter matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late oscar-winner george burns) for a final reunion show on stage . <br /><br />benjamin martin is matthau's agent and nephew ,  and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns .  i love matthau's grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is ,  and yet also very different . <br /><br />burns ,  as the absent-minded old man ,  is just as funny as matthau . <br /><br />matthau: want some crackers? i've got coconut ,  pineapple and graham . <br /><br />burns: how about a plain cracker?<br /><br />matthau: i don't NOT_got NOT_plain .  i got coconut ,  pineapple and graham . <br /><br />burns: okay<br /><br />matthau: they're in the cupboard in the kitchen . <br /><br />burns: maybe later . <br /><br />or how about this:<br /><br />matthau: when i did black ,  the whites knew what i was saying!<br /><br />you've got to see it in the movie to understand it!<br /><br />all in all ,  a refreshingly hilarious ,  sweet ,  heartfelt ,  warm ,  belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time .  <br /><br />they just don't NOT_make NOT_them NOT_like NOT_this NOT_anymore!

446 0 not NOT_a NOT_`woman NOT_film' NOT_but NOT_film NOT_for NOT_the NOT_gang .  one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman .  director andy mckay simply doesn't NOT_know NOT_woman .  peaks of bad taste ,  american pie's humor style ,  crude story ,  no NOT_sense ,  groundless story ,  refuted characters .  vulgar fantasies came to life on screen .  insulting and definitely not NOT_funny .  i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it . 
447 1 in one of neil simon's best plays .  creaky ,  cranky ex-vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special .  the problem is they haven't even seen each other in over a decade .  full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes ,  this story flies along with a steady stream of humor .  good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew ,  rosetta lenoire as the nurse ,  and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director .  steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves .  trivia note: the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler ,  bessie love ,  polly moran ,  cliff edwards ,  charles king ,  gus edwards ,  and the singing brox sisters . 
448 0 the worst thing about crush is not NOT_that NOT_it's NOT_acted NOT_pretty NOT_bad ,  or that the plot is virtually non-existent ,  and it's not NOT_even NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_that NOT_the NOT_camerawork NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been NOT_better . <br /><br />no ,  the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come . <br /><br />but in the end ,  it's too little ,  too late .  if you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means ,  don't NOT_miss NOT_it . <br /><br />i myself am not NOT_exactly NOT_thrilled NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_things NOT_listed NOT_above NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie ,  and as a result i had a pretty horrible time .  the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_it . <br /><br />the verdict: 4/10 .  guilty of wasting my time . <br /><br /> 
449 1 the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies .  i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since .  i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters ,  and if it was playing today i'd go out to see it again . <br /><br />now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads .  matthau was brilliant ,  but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson's oscar winning performance of randall p .  macmurphy in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest .  burns did win ,  though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well .  even the smallest roles were played to perfection ,  like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial .  <br /><br />which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film ,  the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross .  ross who previously brought a two person play ,  "the owl and the pussycat" to the screen and made a full movie out of it ,  does it again .  he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play .  he fleashens out the story and the characters . <br /><br />here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play ,  where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special .  though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes ,  the sequence itself is totally new .  a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall ,  which was wonderful .  but i think that ross and screenwriter ,  playwright simon improved on it .  it's just a wonderful film . 
450 0 spoiler: the young lover ,  jed ,  is kicked out by the spinster ,  kate (andie mcdowell) ,  because she wrongly believes that jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends .  kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto .  kate throws jed's shoes out the door .  jed reluctantly leaves ,  and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on .  then he gets run over ("crushed" ,  one of the meaning of the title) by a truck .  and dies . <br /><br />"and then he gets run over by a truck . " can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? up to then ,  its a comedy that intends to be frothy ,  but lacks any real fizz .  everybody but jed is just annoying .  and then they kill jed ,  and everybody's sad ,  until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive ,  instead of destructive .  i give it 2 ugh's . 
451 1 this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler .  when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street ,  especially the character eloise who's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle ,  like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star .  this film ,  like most race films ,  keeps people watching because of the great entertainment .  race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era .  the dancing styles ,  the music ,  dressing styles ,  you'll love it .  this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood ,  it would of had better scenery ,  better filming ,  and more money which would make any movie better .  but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has .  i have to say out of all micheaux's films ,  swing is the best! the movie features singers ,  dancers ,  actresses ,  and actors who were popular but forgotten today .  doli armena ,  a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky .  the sexy ,  hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame . <br /><br />adding further info .  .  .  popular blues singer of the 20's and 30's cora green is the focus of the film ,  she's mandy ,  a good ,  hard working woman with a no NOT_good NOT_man NOT_who NOT_takes NOT_her NOT_money NOT_and NOT_spend NOT_it NOT_on NOT_other NOT_women .  a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive ,  curvy woman by the name of eloise (played hazel diaz ,  a hot-cha entertainer in the 30's) and a fight breaks out .  then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle .  lena provides mandy with a home ,  a job ,  and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith (played by hazel ,  i guess she's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior .  when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg ,  lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy .  tall ,  long ,  lanky ,  but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well .  pretty boy larry seymour plays the no NOT_good NOT_man NOT_but NOT_after NOT_lena NOT_threatens NOT_him ,  he might shape up .  there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith (hazel diaz) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that's not NOT_enough ,  she almost gets into a fight with mandy again .  in between there's great entertainment by chorus girls ,  tap dancers ,  shake dancers ,  swing music ,  and blues singing .  there's even white people watching the entertainment ,  i wonder where micheaux found them ,  there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club ,  micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films ,  he should be commended for such a bold move . <br /><br />this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux .  this movie is one of the best of the race film genre ,  its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business . <br /><br />no these early race films may not NOT_be NOT_the NOT_best ,  can't NOT_be NOT_compared NOT_with NOT_hallelujah ,  green pastures ,  stormy weather ,  cabin in the sky ,  carmen jones ,  or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person's eyes .  these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life ,  be beautiful ,  classy ,  and elegant ,  and not NOT_just NOT_be NOT_stereotypes NOT_or NOT_how NOT_whites NOT_felt NOT_blacks NOT_should NOT_be NOT_portrayed NOT_like NOT_in NOT_hollywood .  most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren't NOT_the NOT_best ,  but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time ,  micheaux and spencer williams couldn't afford nina mae mckinney ,  josephine baker ,  ethel waters ,  fredi washington ,  paul robeson ,  rex ingram ,  and more of the bigger stars ,  so micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies ,  some were good ,  some weren't NOT_great NOT_actors NOT_and NOT_actresses ,  but i think micheaux and others knew most weren't NOT_good NOT_actors NOT_and NOT_actresses NOT_but NOT_they NOT_were NOT_used NOT_more NOT_as NOT_apart NOT_of NOT_an NOT_experiment NOT_than NOT_for NOT_true NOT_talent ,  they just wanted their stories told ,  and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films .  for some true actors/actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work ,  especially if they didn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_play NOT_hollywood NOT_stereotypes ,  so i think you'll be able to spot the true actors/actresses from the nightclub performers .  these race films are very historic ,  they could have been lost forever ,  many are lost ,  maybe race films aren't NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_example NOT_of NOT_cinema NOT_but NOT_even NOT_hollywood NOT_films NOT_didn't NOT_start NOT_out NOT_great NOT_in NOT_the NOT_beginning .  i think if the race film genre continued ,  it would have better .  if your looking for great acting ,  most race films aren't NOT_the NOT_ones ,  but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films ,  than watch race films .  there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast ,  moon over harlem ,  body and soul ,  paradise in harlem ,  keep punching ,  sunday sinners ,  dark manhattan ,  broken strings ,  boy! what a girl ,  mystery in swing ,  miracle in harlem ,  and sepia cinderella ,  that not NOT_only NOT_has NOT_good NOT_entertainment NOT_but NOT_good NOT_acting . 
452 0 andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends . <br /><br />seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man ,  the "girl-friends" ,  dead-set on terminating this "silly relationship" ,  go over and beyond the call of duty in "helping out" their friend (who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game" . <br /><br />a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous .  far fetched no NOT_longer NOT_covers NOT_it .  without these unbelievable scenes ,  there may have been hope for a sweet love story .  instead ,  all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't NOT_happen! NOT_without NOT_giving NOT_away NOT_cliff-hanger NOT_details ,  i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed .  on a scale of 1 to 10 ,  this one ranks a weak 4 with me .  there is much better material out there .  this one isn't NOT_worth NOT_your NOT_time . 
453 1 <br /><br />one of the best films i've ever seen .  robert duvall's performance was excellent and outstanding .  he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life .  his character was so convincing ,  it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live ,  i give it 5 stars . 
454 0 was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? this film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women .  fine .  it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man .  fine .  there are a few antics between them .  fine .  but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie .  it continues in this vein for a while until ,  in the end ,  it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter .  but by now it's too late .  it's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing .  truly a lesson (for british filmmakers anyway) of how not NOT_to NOT_make NOT_films .  difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work .  and the box office proved it to be a real flop ,  because i'd never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film NOT_until NOT_this NOT_weekend NOT_(four NOT_years NOT_after NOT_its NOT_release) . 
455 1 robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e .  lee ,  according the imdb . com movie database .  after seeing this film ,  you may think duvall's appearance is reincarnation at it's best .  one of my most favorite films .  i wish the composer ,  peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available .  wonderful scenery and music and "all too-true-to-life , " especially for those of us that live in ,  or have moved to ,  the south .  this is a "real moment in time . " life moves on ,  slowly ,  but "strangers we do not NOT_remain . " 
456 0 i thought it was a new-york located movie: wrong! it's a little british countryside setting . <br /><br />i thought it was a comedy: wrong! it's a drama .  .  .  .  well ,  up to the last third ,  because after the story becomes totally "abracadabrantesque" ,  the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate .  it means ,  close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling . <br /><br />what do i have left? maybe ,  a good duo of actress: yes ,  i know ,  they are 3 friends ,  but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me .  the tall doctoress surprises by her punch ,  and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual ,  all in delicate ,  soft and almost mute attitude .  this gentleness puzzles me ,  because as other fine artists or directors ,  the same pattern is repeating over and over .  in her case ,  it's like ,  whatever the movie ,  it's always the same character defined by her feelings ,  her values ,  who lives infinite different stories .  i still don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_set NOT_the NOT_limit NOT_(or NOT_the NOT_fusion) NOT_between NOT_the NOT_artists NOT_and NOT_the NOT_works . <br /><br />another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view .  the women have each their own way of living ,  even if they are all single .  it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people . <br /><br />finally ,  the movie is quite viewable ,  but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision . 
457 1 "convicts" is very much a third act sort of film .  all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day .  and ,  by extension ,  the life of its main character ,  soll (robert duvall) . <br /><br />this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote .  six years earlier ,  the worked together on "the trip to bountiful" ,  a film that seems almost action-packed in comparison to this one .  masterson is not NOT_necessarily NOT_a NOT_good NOT_director .  in fact ,  he's just barely this side of adequate .  the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita ,  who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth . <br /><br />because this is essentially a filmed play ,  with little in the way of editing or directing prowess ,  it all comes to the acting .  as far as i'm concerned there's no NOT_flaws NOT_here .  robert duvall and james earl jones ,  two of the best american actors (both born in january 1931) ,  create characters that are wholly real ,  uninterested in anything besides living .  lukas haas ,  a young actor who i was familiar with from "testament" and "witness" ,  plays a character very much like his other early roles .  he is quiet ,  withdrawn ,  slightly scared and sad ,  somehow .  these are qualities that seem natural from him . <br /><br />perhaps a title like "convicts" is a disservice to this film .  that title ,  along with the opening scene ,  seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture .  if slow-paced stage productions don't NOT_interest NOT_you NOT_terribly ,  you'll want to pass on this one as well .  otherwise ,  this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often . <br /><br />enjoy .

459 1 in today's world of digital fabrication ,  there is no NOT_computer NOT_than NOT_can NOT_replace NOT_the NOT_actor NOT_and NOT_writer .  alas ,  this type of "character driven" film is far too rare these days .  duvall's performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations .  i wonder if this movie was made for tv? it has a "close-up" personal quality to the narrative .  it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding .  the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer ,  but pretty pictures are not NOT_everything .  how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing? 
460 0 this was awful .  andie macdowell is a terrible actress .  so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job .  but then remember that turn in four weddings ,  equally as excruciating .  another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages ,  and village greens .  i mean that school ,  how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that? the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat ( a nauseating british series set in the 60s) . this film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships .  if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just) .  but those scenes just didn't NOT_work NOT_with NOT_the NOT_tragedy NOT_in NOT_the NOT_second NOT_half .  i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour .  a final note- what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo? not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_anna NOT_chancellor .  macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream . 
461 1 when i first saw this film on cable ,  it instantly became one of my favorite movies .  i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall .  the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes .  most of the attitudes came from soll ,  an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor .  soll is what makes the move ,  his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then .  i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease .  none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex .  while he has racist views ,  he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black .  the two convicts he trusts most are jackson(mel winkler) and ben(james earl jones) .  the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie ,  they have real chemistry .  james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass . <br /><br />this movie should have gotten more notoriety .  however it's on dvd and worth the money . <br /><br />rayvyn 
462 0 this starts off bad ,  what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin ,  endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story ,  and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an english school ,  believe it or not) ,  only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend'  .   .  . and then from there ,  it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started ,  drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah .  andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street ,  in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth .  have mercy . 
463 1 this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions .  it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy .  you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs .  and ,  it ends very upbeat 
464 0 this had to be one of the worst films ever .  when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping .  .  . so hollywood .  another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement .  andie's acting is so bad in this film - i could not NOT_connect NOT_with NOT_them NOT_or NOT_feel NOT_there NOT_love NOT_for NOT_each NOT_other .  the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed andie .  anyway this was such a campy movie .  i usually like these type of films but i just couldn't get into this film .  too many unlikely situations and again andie's acting didn't NOT_help NOT_the NOT_film .  also ,  she is all gums .  lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals . 
465 1 what a delightful movie .  the characters were not NOT_only NOT_lively NOT_but NOT_alive ,  mirroring real every day life and strife within a family .  each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends . <br /><br />the story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama ,  the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops .  the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions ,  actions and reactions of the characters to conflict ,  opinion ,  and resolve . <br /><br />not an epic ,  but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones .  plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy . 
466 0 this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral .  in fact ,  if they'd called it sex at a funeral ,  they might have done better at the box office . <br /><br />but the film falls between two stools and can't NOT_get NOT_up .  the characters spout improbably bright dialog ,  but never NOT_act NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way NOT_remotely NOT_recognizable NOT_as NOT_human .  one arbitrary ,  senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot ,  and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise . <br /><br />andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out ,  but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton ,  as of all things ,  a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?) .  ms .  staunton seems unable to make a false move .  would that we could say the same about the writer-director . <br /><br />if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus ,  stay away from this one .  phonus bolognus on the half-shell . 
467 1 i actually found this movie 'interesting'; finally one worth my time to watch and rent .  it is true .  .  .  some scenes were over the top on emotionalism ,  shouting ,  etc .  ,  but what movie doesn't NOT_stress NOT_its NOT_agenda ,  genre or 'ax to grind'? almost none! what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a s . fran reviewer on another review site ,  but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his "own" review of the movie; not NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_at NOT_all .  anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no NOT_car NOT_chases ,  yea!! being "in" an italian family myself ,  i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen .  the movie has its tear jerking parts as well .  it is what real life can be in such an environment .  nice movie . 
468 0 this film was choppy ,  incoherent and contrived .  it was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women .  i rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch) ,  and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it .  she wasn't .  i'm a gal ,  i watched this film with two guys ,  and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was . <br /><br />warning: plot summary below! rampant spoilers!<br /><br />the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man ,  to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends .  they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her .  but she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out ,  and sure enough ,  she decides to marry the guy .  but her harpy girlfriend ,  aided by the wishy-washy one ,  sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her .  it works .  she has a fight with him ,  he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (remember the movie's title?) so now he's dead ,  two-thirds of the way through the film .  and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls ,  she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant . <br /><br />she's already broken off relations with her girlfriends ,  because they were so unsupportive .  alone and pitiful ,  she decides to marry the boring guy .  did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? she had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice ,  huh?) ,  but now she tells him she'll marry him ,  and apparently he has no NOT_objections NOT_to NOT_being NOT_dicked NOT_around NOT_in NOT_this NOT_fashion .  but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home ,  where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed .  she has the kid .  in the final scene ,  they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink ,  smoke and be smug .  i kid you not ,  it's that bad .  i left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment . 
469 1 i've always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor ,  now i know she is a great writer/director also .  i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies "perfect" ,  "my favorite year" ,  "dc cab" and "stardust memories" . <br /><br />it's so rare to see lee grant these days in anything .  she has been missing from the screen for far too long .  it's also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sit-com .  this is her best work since "the last picture show" .  if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie .  i wasn't NOT_expecting NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_when NOT_i NOT_started NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_movie ,  so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie .  if you get the chance ,  watch it . 
470 0 the fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour .  in fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side ,  none of these questions will be answered .  this is the type of fare that appeals to the "he woman ,  man hater" clubs of america .  as presented ,  it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be "caught up" in a romance with a married ,  high-profile attorney .  is it possible that if ,  she had not NOT_been NOT_two NOT_timing NOT_her NOT_boy NOT_friend NOT_and NOT_having NOT_an NOT_affair NOT_with NOT_a NOT_married NOT_man ,  the whole nasty murderous ,  sordid incident could have been avoided? when you watch this ,  don't NOT_worry NOT_about NOT_going NOT_to NOT_the NOT_'fridge ,  you won't NOT_miss NOT_anything . 
471 1 a wonderful movie! anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters .  a good family movie with sadness ,  humor ,  and very good acting from all .  you will enjoy this movie!! we need more like it . 
472 0 i very nearly walked out ,  but i'd paid my money ,  and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out .  after the endearing ,  wide-eyed innocence of "a new hope" and the thrilling sophistication of "the empire strikes back , " i remember awaiting "return of the jedi" with almost aching anticipation .  but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage ,  i was bitterly disappointed ,  and enraged at lucas .  he should have been ashamed of himself ,  but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't NOT_have NOT_subatomic NOT_particle NOT_of NOT_shame NOT_in NOT_his NOT_cold ,  greedy heart .  episode i would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor ,  i call jarjar binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first) . <br /><br />from the initial raising of the gate at jabba's lair ,  this "film" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable ,  profit-making action figures as lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards ,  the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky ,  that vile muppet-pet of jabba's ,  the new and recycled cabaret figures ,  the monsters ,  etc .  ,  etc .  ,  ad vomitum .  then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks .  pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens .  fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection .  the blatant ,  exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating . <br /><br />lucas didn't NOT_even NOT_bother NOT_to NOT_come NOT_up NOT_with NOT_a NOT_new NOT_plot NOT_-- NOT_he NOT_just NOT_exhumed NOT_the NOT_death NOT_star NOT_from NOT_"a NOT_new NOT_hope" NOT_and NOT_heaved NOT_in NOT_a NOT_boatload NOT_of NOT_cheap NOT_sentiment .  what an appalling slap in the face to his fans .  i can't NOT_shake NOT_the NOT_notion NOT_that NOT_lucas NOT_took NOT_a NOT_perverse NOT_pleasure NOT_in NOT_inflicting NOT_this NOT_dreck NOT_on NOT_his NOT_fans: NOT_"i've NOT_got NOT_these NOT_lemmings NOT_hooked NOT_so NOT_bad NOT_that NOT_i NOT_can NOT_crank NOT_out NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_stinking ,  putrid garbage that i could dream up ,  and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up .  plus ,  all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped ,  cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in ,  and i get a cut from every single one .  it'll make me even more obscenely rich . "<br /><br />there may have been a paltry ,  partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off .  i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool .  but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total ,  absolute sell-out to profit . 
473 1 it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again .  "the amati girls" is such a movie .  in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings .  was this story autobiographical for the writer/director? it has the aura of reality . <br /><br />the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness .  who would not NOT_want NOT_mercedes NOT_ruehl NOT_as NOT_an NOT_older NOT_sister? NOT_i NOT_have NOT_loved NOT_her NOT_work NOT_since NOT_"for NOT_roseanna" . <br /><br />with most movies ,  one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors ,  producers ,  directors ,  sound technicians ,  etc .  it was hard to suspend such belief in "the amati girls" .  one feels such a part of this family! how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life .  and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman's hair color .  the humor throughout is not NOT_belly NOT_laugh NOT_humor ,  but instead has a feel-good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such . <br /><br />the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished . <br /><br />it is no NOT_coincidence NOT_that NOT_the NOT_family NOT_name ,  amati ,  translated from the italian means 'the loved ones' . 
474 0 after being hugely entertained by mr .  brosnan's performance as a cad in "the tailor of panama" (which i rate 10/10 across the board: casting ,  acting ,  script ,  story ,  editing ,  pace ,  music ,  emotional impact ,  etc . ) ,  i enthusiastically anticipated this film .  i was hugely disappointed .  it is a script reading not NOT_a NOT_film ,  vulgar for the sake of being vulgar ,  bankrupt in every way that "the tailor of panama" is rich and satisfying .  blame it on the screen writing and directing .  i sat in the theater waiting for the "good part;" it never NOT_came .  i neither laughed nor cried ,  although one line of dialog did make me smile .  worth $7? hardly . 
475 1 growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's ,  i grew up very close to most of the italian families living there .  this move brought back so many pleasant memories .  this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies . 
476 0 a cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland .  the romance is very unrealistic ,  fluttery ,  lovey dovey ,  perfect etc .  the cinderella plot till the very end and shahid kapoor is the only reason for my stars .  if you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist ,  this is definitely you're movie ,  but for the rest of us real world people ,  i'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time .  wake up people!<br /><br />four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not NOT_recommend NOT_the NOT_film .  we had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes .  maybe i'm missing something .  .  i just can't NOT_believe NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_like NOT_this NOT_can NOT_beat NOT_a NOT_classic NOT_like NOT_hddcs!! 
477 1 can scarcely imagine a better movie than this<br /><br />hey ,  before you all go "chick flick" on me .  i am a very large strong & masculine ,  macho man ,  who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years .  <br /><br />the acting was superb and the story was marvelous .  this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul .  the acting could not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_better NOT_nor NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_better NOT_cast .  <br /><br />i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl ,  along with holly hunter ,  joan plowright ,  dame edith evans ,  sissy spacek ,  judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film .  and of course cloris leachman (also in this film) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years .  .  at any rate this was an amazing cast .  this film was like a book that you cannot lay down ,  and when you have reached the last page wish for more .  .  . still more .  i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 3 . 9<br /><br />that rating here is utterly amazing to me .  or perhaps not .  perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad .  it makes me ever so sad that films like "american beauty" "leaving las vegas" "sexy beast" and "fight club" ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an "r" rating .  .  . r that is for "rubbish" .  hey o . k .  ,  i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences ,  but it is a sad commentary when this lovely ,  powerful .  .  . extraordinarily ,  directed ,  acted ,  and written film seems to be over looked .  <br /><br />it obviously was at the academy awards as well .  .  .  . how sad .  and how predictable .  my summation is that if you want to see a powerful ,  happy ,  sad ,  beautiful story? watch  .  .  .  .  .  . preferably own this film .  .  . 
478 0 i won't NOT_say NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_bad ,  but it wasn't NOT_good NOT_either .  i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this .  this was completely old fashioned .  at every stage of this movie ,  i hoped for some twist and what do i get? the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love .  <br /><br />despite of being engaged ,  they have to take permission for every little move they make .  they are so darn shy even after so many meetings .  i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that .  all she did was crib madly .  <br /><br />hey ,  we have kids too ,  but we don't NOT_watch NOT_them NOT_and NOT_have NOT_tears NOT_in NOT_our NOT_eyes NOT_always .  this movie is a dream .  happy family ,  one cruel woman ,  good in-laws and a man who loves her to death .  in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa .  and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie .  anyway i believe i wasted my time .  i give it a 2/10 . 
479 1 i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_best NOT_time NOT_mainly NOT_because NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_know NOT_about NOT_ned NOT_kelly NOT_or NOT_his NOT_story . <br /><br />but since this is a biopic ,  it's important to at least know what to expect from the character . <br /><br />i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_the NOT_manner NOT_the NOT_events NOT_are NOT_told NOT_are NOT_true ,  or if it everything is fictional .  but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true .  i don't NOT_think NOT_he's NOT_portrayed NOT_as NOT_a NOT_redneck NOT_criminal NOT_or NOT_thief ,  but that's just my opinion . <br /><br />this is a solid western-type movie for everybody's tastes .  heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen . <br /><br />give this movie a chance if it airs on cable .  otherwise ,  i don't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_could NOT_recommend NOT_it .

481 1 fantastic movie .  one to excite all 5 senses .  is not NOT_a NOT_true NOT_historical NOT_report NOT_and NOT_not NOT_all NOT_information NOT_is NOT_to NOT_be NOT_taken NOT_as NOT_factual NOT_information .  true hollywood conventions used ,  like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes' ,  such as naomi watts (julia cook - ned kelly's lover) ,  heath ledger (ned) and orlando bloom (joe byrne - ned's right hand man) ,  and unattractive (sorry geoffrey rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force .  this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned (ledger) and julia cook (watts) to entice all the romantics ,  females being especially susceptible .  even from the first scene ,  when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me ,  his hand on me shoulder , " it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly ,  the underdog .  besides ,  don't NOT_all NOT_aussies NOT_love NOT_an NOT_underdog? 
482 0 in director sooraj barjatya's vivah , 20-something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure ,  small-town girl his father has selected for him to marry .  drawn to her innocence and simplicity ,  shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he's met her at her home in madhupur ,  and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor .  the marriage is fixed for six months later ,  and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young ,  budding love ,  their geographical distance notwithstanding .  but amrita ,  who's been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents' death ,  is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage .  and then ,  it's up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally . much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain ,  barjatya's new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise .  but sadly ,  the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated ,  even more far-fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps .  and the problem is clear â– you just can't NOT_relate NOT_to NOT_such NOT_squeaky-clean NOT_characters NOT_who NOT_don't NOT_have NOT_one NOT_bad NOT_bone NOT_in NOT_their NOT_bodies .  there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films ,  and timing is one such important factor .  twenty-five years ago ,  perhaps the plot of vivah may not NOT_have NOT_felt NOT_like NOT_such NOT_a NOT_stretch ,  but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp .  perhaps the film's only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish ,  you can make out right away that the filmmaker's intention is not NOT_to NOT_deceive .  judging both by barjatya's previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world ,  he believes in his good-as-gold characters ,  he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps . but alas ,  he's unable to translate his vision to the screen .  it's difficult to overlook how one-dimensional his protagonists are â– shahid and amrita ,  both virtuous and virginal â– i mean ,  think about it ,  the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film .  barjatya may think he's returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah ,  but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film ,  or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry .  because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah ,  those pairs had mischief and masti .  shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring . for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story ,  the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s-style tunes that only further slacken the film's deadening pace .  but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn't NOT_work NOT_for NOT_me ,  it's because i'm not NOT_sure NOT_i NOT_can NOT_relate NOT_to NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_who NOT_inhabit NOT_barjatya's NOT_story .  to some perhaps ,  vivah will give hope ,  that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere .  but i'm a little cynical i guess .  so ,  give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun ,  give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya ,  i'll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain .  but save me from these dullards .  you know ,  some marriages aren't NOT_made NOT_in NOT_heaven .  this one's vivah! 
483 1 i'm tired of people judging films on their "historical accuracy" .  it's a movie people!! the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story! there are a number of movies out there that aren't NOT_entirely NOT_accurate NOT_with NOT_the NOT_history .  .  .  . braveheart ,  wyatt earp ,  gangs of new york ,  geronimo: an american legend ,  the last of the mohicans .  .  .  . all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically .  if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best ,  then i suggest you see this film and don't NOT_worry NOT_about NOT_the NOT_accuracy NOT_of NOT_the NOT_facts .  just enjoy the quality of the film ,  the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time . 
484 0 from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no NOT_sense NOT_to NOT_bad NOT_dialogue NOT_and NOT_disjointed NOT_scenes NOT_to NOT_the NOT_ultimate NOT_downer ,  bad acting (even peter falk can't NOT_find NOT_his NOT_way) NOT_"finding NOT_john NOT_christmas" NOT_is NOT_better NOT_left NOT_lost .  ms .  bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars ,  william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah .  jennifer pisana as soccoro ,  the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing .  but who can blame them with material like this .  michael j .  murray's script is juvenile at best .  <br /><br />each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen .  films like "miracle on 34th street" ,  ernst lubitsch's delightful "the shop around the corner" and ,  of course the 1951 version of "scrooge" .  there's frank capra's classics "it's a wonderful life" and "meet john doe" .  hey ,  forget the classics .  what about "home alone" or " home for the holidays" with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr . ? <br /><br />my present to you is by way of advice .  your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "finding john christmas" .  merry christmas! 
485 1 i thought that this film was very well made ,  heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless .  orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable .  how true it is to what really happened i have no NOT_idea ,  but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do .  maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30 , 000 signed a petition for ned kelly not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_hanged ,  so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film .  all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't NOT_do NOT_better NOT_in NOT_the NOT_cinemas . 
486 0 william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie .  he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts .  but he tries to keep away from his family .  thats where peter falk (colombo) comes in ,  playing several different roles ,  to convince him to come home . <br /><br />the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (peter falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree .  but william russ wasn't NOT_truly NOT_a NOT_star .  however ,  it appears his acting is still ok . <br /><br />i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable .  in fact ,  the last 20 minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened .  a good movie should never NOT_be NOT_like NOT_that . <br /><br />overall ,  it was a sub-par movie .  in a letter grading system ,  it would receive a "d" . 
487 1 definitely one of my favourite movies .  the story is good ,  acting is great ,  all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever . <br /><br />heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly .  he is gripping as the legendary outlaw ,  and is supported well by geoffrey rush ,  naomi watts and orlando bloom .  all action sequences are on point<br /><br />the film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end .  one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger ,  who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in .  and makes no NOT_mistake NOT_here . <br /><br />an excellent film all round . 
488 0 the silent one-panel cartoon henry comes to fleischer studios ,  billed as "the world's funniest human" in this dull little cartoon .  betty ,  long past her prime ,  thanks to the production code ,  is running a pet shop and leaves henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes .  a bore . 
489 1 i didn't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_to NOT_expect NOT_from NOT_'ned NOT_kelly' ,  but absolutely loved it .  it was dark ,  dramatic and gripping .  it also felt very authentic ,  i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800's .  i've never NOT_been NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_heath NOT_ledger NOT_fan ,  having only seen him in teen type movies ,  however he is quite compelling in this role .  ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity ,  showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia's most notorious killer .  naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly's society lover .  highly recommended - and that's from an aussie! 
490 0 beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made ,  yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting . <br /><br />the opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets ,  as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue .  before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad ,  the credits roll and the action struggles to life . <br /><br />and aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes ,  you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time .  pure genius . <br /><br />the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy ,  so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely .  perhaps i own the only copy in existence . <br /><br /> 
491 1 the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom .  simply put ,  the movie was spectacularly average .  it's not NOT_bad ,  but it's really not NOT_very NOT_good .  the editing is good; the film is well-paced .  the direction is competent and assured .  the story is plodding .  the film is averagely acted by ledger ,  bloom ,  and the normally great watts and rush .  the accents are impenetrable if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as i like to call it ,  orlando bloom) .  by the end of the film ,  i was neither bored nor moved .  some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie .  i have to say ,  i so did not NOT_care NOT_by NOT_that NOT_point . <br /><br />really ,  the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of ,  sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present "i'm pretty and confused" look is prominent) ,  so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price .  other than that ,  just don't NOT_see NOT_it .  it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining . 
492 0 this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules verne's "mysterious island" .  the sound editing is pretty bad .  you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new hampshire .  for those living in new engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital w .  this film is full of flaws .  you get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress .  "ok now stand up . " as for the other characters .  there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien .  the alien guy talks with a deep voice .  when he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice .  as for the special effects ,  man! this was brett piper's early work for crying out loud! the creatures are good but the animation is jerky .  really jerky .  sort of like karl zeman animation in journey to beginning of time (1955) .  the special effects are imaginative .  thge music is good .  bottom line ,  this film makes equinox or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray harryhausen epic .  did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? a must watch for aspiring film makers . 
493 1 how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together? well ,  i couldn't and so ,  i rented this mess of a movie . <br /><br />i had never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_ned NOT_kelly NOT_and NOT_was NOT_surprised NOT_by NOT_what NOT_i NOT_found NOT_out NOT_about NOT_this NOT_young NOT_man's NOT_legend .  i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was .  perhaps the fact that it was very ,  very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow ,  i found this story difficult to follow .  not NOT_because NOT_the NOT_story NOT_is NOT_complicated ,  but because it is slow .  even with a slow story ,  ledger and bloom managed to create interesting ,  dimensional characters .  <br /><br />though i flounder to recommend this as a must see ,  it is a great story of australian history (considering how young the country is ,  this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences .  <br /><br />6/10 see it for historical value .  .  .  . (yeah right .  .  . and that's the only reason to see it .  .  .  ;) ) 
494 0 it was 9:30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park (a new episode) .  the thing is ,  in my country ,  south park airs at 10:30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing ,  father of the pride .  i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes .  the first time i watched it ,  i found it unfunny and crude for nothing ,  so i thought ''holy sh*t ,  i have a football game early tomorrow ,  so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons'' .  but yesterday ,  i tried to give father of the pride a second chance .  i find that it's a complete rip-off of the simpsons ,  only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead . <br /><br />the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv-14 rating .  i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar ,  and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes .  the simpsons is also a lot more violent (halloween specials) and crude .  i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 ,  well i've got news for him: shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic .  however ,  i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times . <br /><br />all in all ,  i don't NOT_mind NOT_father NOT_of NOT_the NOT_pride .  i don't NOT_hate NOT_it ,  but i don't NOT_like NOT_either .  i've seen way better from ''the simpsons'' . <br /><br />3 . 5/10 
495 1 i loves this movie , because it showed that they were not NOT_killing NOT_for NOT_fun NOT_but NOT_to NOT_save NOT_the NOT_ones NOT_they NOT_loved! NOT_heath NOT_ledger NOT_and NOT_orlando NOT_bloom NOT_did NOT_a NOT_great NOT_job NOT_portraying NOT_ned NOT_and NOT_joe .  it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that .  the language is very mild and sometimes don't NOT_even NOT_know NOT_it NOT_is NOT_there .  this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not NOT_mean NOT_that NOT_they NOT_are NOT_vicious NOT_killers! NOT_i NOT_hope NOT_that NOT_people NOT_will NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_learn NOT_about NOT_important NOT_times NOT_in NOT_history NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one .  there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at! also that that is how people remember them , from their armor .  i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have . 
496 0 when will the hurting stop? i never NOT_want NOT_to NOT_see NOT_another NOT_version NOT_of NOT_a NOT_christmas NOT_carol NOT_again .  they keep on making movies with the same story ,  falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest ,  but sadly fail to do so ,  as this is not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_story .  moralistic ,  old-fashioned ,  conservative happy-thinking .  as if people learn .  the numerous different versions of this film prove that we donâ´t . 
497 1 'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero .  we are taken into the world of ned ,  his best friend ,  joe byrne ,  and the other members of the kelly gang ,  as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned's actions . <br /><br />there is an exceptional cast present ,  who all give stellar performances ,  which brings the film to life .  (great job ,  heath!) orlando bloom was fantastic as joe ,  playing the role of quiet ,  loyal ladiesman very well .  i was swept up in the moment .  for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan ,  alas ,  it was not NOT_to NOT_be . <br /><br />some aspects of the film are fictional ,  and as an avid ned kelly fan (and supporter) ,  was slightly disappointed by this .  perhaps also the film could've gone longer ,  to cover more of the kelly gang's/ned's life - i felt not NOT_enough NOT_was NOT_covered . <br /><br />regardless of a few flaws ,  this is a moving film ,  which stirs all sorts of emotions .  (and hey ,  i'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned .  .  . ) 
498 0 saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was .  don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong ,  george c .  scott was terrific as scrooge ,  but the rest of the cast fails so very badly .  sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: "merry christmas to everyone!" other times i almost fell asleep . <br /><br />the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy ,  who don't NOT_think NOT_christmas NOT_is NOT_nothing NOT_but NOT_humbug .  after 30 minutes ,  the rich guy is visited by three ghosts ,  who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all . <br /><br />i can not NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_this NOT_movie ,  with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes ,  can be so well-rated .  instead of this piece of garbage ,  i recommend to you ,  the bill murray comedy scrooged .  that at least ,  was funny .  .  . 
499 1 i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over ,  and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film .  when i saw the trailer for the first time ,  i could not NOT_take NOT_my NOT_eyes NOT_away NOT_from NOT_it NOT_(it NOT_got NOT_my NOT_attention NOT_for NOT_sure) .  heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him ,  period pieces .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_orlando NOT_bloom NOT_ , who is seen for a split second looks fantastic .  i think that this movie will be a hit ,  and will be seen over and over again my many people . 
500 0 having seen three other versions of the same film ,  i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest ,  primarily due to scott's rather dull and leaden performance .  his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film .  alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better .  when scrooge was at his meanest ,  you don't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_sense NOT_scott NOT_is NOT_saying NOT_the NOT_dialogue NOT_with NOT_much NOT_conviction NOT_and NOT_when NOT_he NOT_undergoes NOT_his NOT_metamorphosis NOT_he NOT_is NOT_similarly NOT_unconvincing .  i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version .  even the musical version (and frankly the muppets) take on this are better executed .  very disappointing . 
501 1 those who know who know the kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg .  naomi watt's character never NOT_existed NOT_in NOT_reality) ,  but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment ,  it holds up pretty well .  ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid ,  taking the mantle of cinema's best ned (not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious ,  mick jagger & former carlton champion (australian rules football) bob chitty ,  a great footballer but a poor actor .  some location shooting film in the area i live ,  bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes & ballarat . 
502 0 i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week .  my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too .  i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen . <br /><br />boy ,  was i disappointed .  this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable .  george c .  scott is an excellent actor but in this ,  it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time .  the rest of the time he was quite flat . <br /><br />i realize that this was made in '84 ,  pre-cg effects ,  for the most part .  but it looked to be very b-movie quality ,  especially the encounter with jacob marley . <br /><br />the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world ,  observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime . <br /><br />i will admit that mr .  scott did a good job with the "reformed" scrooge at the end .  that was a refreshing portrayal . <br /><br />i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden .  and tiny tim .  .  .  oh don't NOT_even NOT_get NOT_me NOT_started NOT_on NOT_bad NOT_child NOT_actors .  .  . 
503 1 'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli' .  such was ned's bravery . <br /><br />in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised .  in greta he is still a hero ,  the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created ,  but in mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there . <br /><br />many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing .  from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged ,  to the post office he held up in jerilderie .  a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel ,  the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited . <br /><br />evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over victoria ,  in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning .  none of this is wrong ,  and whats left out would further justify neds actions .  the horse that ned 'stole' was actually stolen by wild wright (the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail) .  ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it . <br /><br />the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before .  it is not NOT_self NOT_justification NOT_it NOT_is NOT_ned's NOT_biography ,  an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting .  so go ahead and read it ,  watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for . 
504 0 uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation ,  in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt ,  and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; edward woodward ,  as the ghost of christmas present ,  wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins .  as scrooge ,  george c .  scott is too wry ,  and he never NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_truly NOT_believe NOT_in NOT_it ,  which robs his performance of its effect .  the scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album .  no NOT_one NOT_else NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be NOT_putting NOT_any NOT_effort NOT_in ,  except frank finlay ,  who chronically overacts . 
505 1 the performances were superb ,  the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian ,  i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail . <br /><br />i wouldn't NOT_say NOT_you NOT_need NOT_any NOT_knowledge NOT_of NOT_the NOT_kelly NOT_saga NOT_to NOT_stay NOT_with NOT_the NOT_flow NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_to NOT_comprehend NOT_the NOT_happenings NOT_and NOT_attitudes NOT_of NOT_the NOT_time NOT_you NOT_will NOT_require NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_of NOT_basic NOT_historical NOT_knowledge .  do not NOT_expect ,  as some rather silly people do ,  any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it ,  it was ,  at that time ,  a country during infancy . <br /><br />ok ,  the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film .  gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest' ,  and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here . <br /><br />see it and you will not NOT_be NOT_sorry 
506 0 the premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't NOT_me NOT_to NOT_pretend NOT_that NOT_i'm NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_critic .  with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low .  i'm a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not NOT_so NOT_great NOT_work NOT_along NOT_with NOT_doa NOT_2 NOT_and NOT_3 ,  and some others (many) . <br /><br />the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong .  this is a highschoolers approach to cinema .  for the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no NOT_real NOT_reason NOT_completely NOT_annoying NOT_(and NOT_yes ,  this does take away from the film) ,  the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis ,  and the acting .  .  . well .  .  . hmmm .  <br /><br />if one is a takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests .  it lacks any originality (see the neverending story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one .  <br /><br />as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co-writing ,  but that doesn't NOT_mean NOT_much NOT_as NOT_non NOT_of NOT_what NOT_we'd NOT_hope NOT_would NOT_be NOT_miike's NOT_personality NOT_would NOT_spill NOT_over NOT_into NOT_the NOT_screen .  all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography . <br /><br />the movie had the potential to be something great .  the premise is not NOT_a NOT_difficult NOT_one NOT_to NOT_run NOT_wild NOT_with .  but this one seemed to have been run into the ground . <br /><br />my suggestion is if you're just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ,  ichi ,  and audition .  then movie into his works like blue's harp ,  fudoh ,  rainy dog ,  bird people of china . 
507 1 the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand ,  and this film is no NOT_exception .  what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him .  during several battles ,  he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron ,  off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce .  indeed ,  it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged .  the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ,  ironically ,  become boring .  the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster ,  the less people pay attention . <br /><br />which is where this adaptation of our sunshine ,  a novel about the kelly legend ,  excels .  rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore ,  the film quickly establishes him as a human being .  indeed ,  the reversal of the popular legend ,  showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists ,  goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd .  here ,  ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder ,  one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it .  no ,  i am not NOT_making NOT_that NOT_up .  about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles .  while the kelly gang were distinctly irish ,  australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this) . <br /><br />heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia's most notorious outlaw .  it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not NOT_kelly NOT_himself .  orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't NOT_look NOT_completely NOT_lost NOT_without NOT_his NOT_bow ,  and geoffrey rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state .  but it is naomi watts ,  appearing as julia cook ,  who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film .  although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life ,  but you would not NOT_know NOT_that NOT_from NOT_the NOT_minimal NOT_screen NOT_time NOT_that NOT_she NOT_gets NOT_here .  indeed ,  a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative .  once the element of police corruption is established ,  in fact ,  the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  most of the film's strengths are not NOT_capitalised NOT_upon .  rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits .  ditto for watts ,  and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins .  i can only conclude that another fifteen ,  or even thirty ,  minutes of footage might have fixed this .  but that leads to the other problem ,  in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact .  one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well ,  but unfortunately ,  it all becomes a collage of moments with no NOT_linking NOT_after NOT_a NOT_while .  if one were to believe the impression that this film creates ,  a matter of weeks ,  even days ,  passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman ,  and the infamous shootout at glenrowan .  annoyingly ,  the trial and execution of ned kelly is not NOT_even NOT_depicted NOT_here ,  simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll . <br /><br />that said ,  aside from some shaky camera-work at times ,  ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts ,  and it has a good beginning .  for that reason ,  i rated it a seven out of ten .  other critics have not NOT_been NOT_so NOT_kind ,  so if you're not NOT_impressed NOT_by NOT_shootouts NOT_with NOT_unusual NOT_elements NOT_(and NOT_what NOT_could NOT_more NOT_more NOT_unusual NOT_than NOT_full NOT_body NOT_armour NOT_in NOT_a NOT_colonial NOT_shootout?) ,  then you might be better off looking elsewhere .  especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life . 
508 0 ah ,  bait .  how do i hate thee? let me count the ways .  1 .  you try to be funny ,  but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected ,  and when it comes ,  does not NOT_inspire NOT_laughter .  instead ,  i want to hurl .  2 .  you try to be dramatic ,  but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree ,  and the "bad guy" looks like bill gates ,  and is about as scary as .  .  . well ,  bill gates .  (just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun .  doesn't NOT_work ,  does it? a lawyer ,  maybe ,  but not NOT_a NOT_gun .  doesn't NOT_fit . ) as for jamie foxx ,  well ,  just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous ,  and makes me want to hurl .  3 .  you try to be action-packed ,  but instead are dull and dragging too many times .  and when the action heats up ,  the tripod for the camera must have been lost ,  for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project ,  and i find myself nauseated ,  and once again i want to hurl .  4 .  you try to be a good movie ,  but you failed ,  you failed ,  you failed! i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no NOT_water ,  no NOT_sunscreen ,  and only meryl streep for company .  this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy ,  and let's not NOT_even NOT_talk NOT_about NOT_the NOT_massive NOT_bomb NOT_that NOT_goes NOT_off NOT_in NOT_a NOT_car NOT_that NOT_jamie NOT_foxx's NOT_character NOT_has NOT_just NOT_driven NOT_off NOT_a NOT_cliff ,  but somehow manages to escape .  .  . just kill me now ,  or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never NOT_have NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_is NOT_this NOT_bad ,  ever again . 
509 1 i'm sure that not NOT_many NOT_people NOT_outside NOT_of NOT_australia NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_the NOT_legend NOT_of NOT_ned NOT_kelly .  i once saw a documentary about the man ,  but that's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him .  and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face .  no-one knows anything about it and probably not NOT_many NOT_people NOT_will NOT_care NOT_about NOT_the NOT_subject . <br /><br />the movie tells the story of ned kelly's life .  the irish immigrant has lived in north-west victoria all his life ,  but has never NOT_been NOT_very NOT_welcome NOT_by NOT_the NOT_authorities .  the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family .  when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes ,  he forms a gang with his brother and two other men .  they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days .  all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen ,  they are outlawed .  finally they take over a pub in glenrowan ,  where they have a party with all the visitors ,  waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up .  but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen .  .  . <br /><br />it's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false .  i guess nobody really knows ,  because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero ,  some kind of robin hood ,  the others will say he was an ordinary criminal ,  a murderer and a thief .  i really couldn't tell you which of them is right ,  perhaps both are ,  but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same . <br /><br />this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors .  heath ledger ,  orlando bloom ,  naomi watts ,  geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known ,  but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like .  i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7 . 5/10 
510 0 are you familiar with concept of children's artwork? while it is not NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_picasso NOT_any NOT_three-year-old NOT_has NOT_ever NOT_accomplished NOT_with NOT_their NOT_fingers ,  you encourage them to do more .  if painting is what makes them happy ,  there should be no NOT_reason NOT_a NOT_parent NOT_should NOT_hold NOT_that NOT_back NOT_on NOT_a NOT_child .  typically ,  if a child loves to paint or draw ,  you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style .  you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles .  well ,  this concept of children's artwork is how i felt about fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait .  while on all accounts it was a horrid film ,  it was impressive to see fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments .  if you have seen either training day or king arthur ,  you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait .  while foxx gives a horrid ,  unchained performance ,  there are certain scenes ,  which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera .  sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film ,  but if you focus just on those scenes ,  you will see why fuqua's name appears on so many "best ofâ…" film lists . <br /><br />i will never NOT_disagree NOT_with NOT_someone NOT_that NOT_fuqua's NOT_eye NOT_behind NOT_the NOT_camera NOT_is NOT_refreshing NOT_and NOT_unique .  his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking .  i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon .  even in the silly feature bait ,  you are witness to fuqua's greatness .  two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end .  in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work .  alas ,  in the rest of this film ,  all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created .  the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood .  we have seen this two often ,  and no NOT_matter NOT_who NOT_you NOT_are NOT_(unless NOT_you NOT_are NOT_charlie NOT_kaufmann) ,  you cannot recreate the wheel .  it is just impossible with this genre ,  and it is proved with bait .  i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen ,  which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film .  i was just tired of the structure ,  and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it ,  he did not . <br /><br />then ,  there was the acting .  while jamie foxx has never NOT_impressed NOT_me NOT_as NOT_an NOT_actor ,  i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try .  i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral .  i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral .  again ,  i was disappointed .  foxx was annoying .  not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sense NOT_that NOT_it NOT_was NOT_the NOT_way NOT_that NOT_his NOT_character NOT_was NOT_to NOT_be ,  but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot .  instead ,  we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh .  adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first ,  an actor second .  fuqua should have stopped this immediately .  foxx's jokes destroyed his character ,  which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of .  instead of character development ,  he would crack a joke .  neither style worked ,  no NOT_joke NOT_was NOT_funny .  the rest of the cast was average .  by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles .  they were brining nothing new to the table ,  nothing solid to the story ,  and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film .  they were pawns filling in dead air space .  fuqua had no NOT_control NOT_over NOT_this NOT_mess ,  and the final verdict only supports that accusation . <br /><br />overall ,  this was a sad film .  with no NOT_creativity NOT_in NOT_sight NOT_and NOT_unmanaged NOT_actors NOT_just NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_upstage NOT_themselves ,  what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand .  foxx was annoying ,  without character lines ,  and a complete bag of cheese .  in each scene i saw no NOT_emotion ,  and when emotion was needed to convey a message ,  he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues .  are my words harsh? i don't NOT_think NOT_so .  when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity ,  some edible characters ,  and themes that seem to hit close to home .  bait contained none of these .  while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film ,  the remaining five hundred were disastrous .  apparently ,  i took the bait when renting this film ,  but now having seen it ,  hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble . <br /><br />grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch) 
511 1 there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordan's 'ned kelly' film did .  initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations ,  and decided to see it for myself .  since then ,  i have acquired both the video and soundtrack ,  and have to say that after several viewings ,  i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film .  it is also wonderful to see something australian! i appreciate its down to earth quality ,  that if you ask me is a rarity ,  as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films .  this film proves that you don't NOT_necessarily NOT_require NOT_fancy NOT_costumes NOT_and NOT_a NOT_glamorous NOT_set NOT_that NOT_absorbs NOT_how NOT_many NOT_millions NOT_of NOT_dollars NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_point .  the cast was a bonus ,  including a variety of well known ,  and might i add ,  good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters .  it is interesting to note ,  that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what ,  and how they only said so many lines .  however ,  if any criticism is due ,  it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded .  in reality ,  these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history .  for example ,  on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much ,  much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt ,  and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film .  also overlooked was the fact that it was not NOT_only NOT_aaron NOT_sheritt's NOT_efforts NOT_alone ,  that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery .  yes ,  this is their interpretation of the story ,  and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention .  i feel that in this case ,  this is the only limitation .  however ,  i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation .  it certainly inspired me to look more closely .  so ,  watch it and decide for yourself .  you might not NOT_like NOT_it NOT_at NOT_all ,  thats your opinion ,  and thats fine .  maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience? for me ,  i'd call it a breath of fresh air! 
512 0 what? is jamie foxx supposed to be funny?does he really believe he is funny?well ,  it's funny watching his confidence in being funny . the man has no NOT_identity NOT_whatsoever .  .  . i mean you can immediately see who his idols are ,  denzel washington and martin lawrence ,  because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies . the only problem is that he does it bad ,  uneven ,  and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel ,  with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence ,  the funny and clumsy-silly comic .  there's no NOT_personal NOT_touch NOT_to NOT_all NOT_that ,  i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell ,  and i'm sure he has nothing to say personally .  he really is mr .  dull-boy in person . <br /><br />i was really hoping hollywood ,  and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom ,  like don cheadle for example ,  but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old . 
513 1 due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was ,  i didn't NOT_go NOT_and NOT_see NOT_this NOT_film NOT_at NOT_the NOT_cinema .  after watching it on dvd ,  i have to say i regret that now .  i'm not NOT_saying NOT_it NOT_is NOT_brilliant ,  but i would venture to say that it is a good movie .  i enjoyed it . <br /><br />people have skulls thicker than ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary .  if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures ,  there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal .  i don't NOT_think NOT_ganghis NOT_kahn NOT_has NOT_ever NOT_once NOT_been NOT_portrayed NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_close NOT_to NOT_historical NOT_fact .  what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate ,  and quite passionate it seems .  in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians ,  ned kelly has become a legend .  legends are stories ,  and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself .  ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesn't NOT_trust NOT_or NOT_accept NOT_authority .  a society in which there is no NOT_dissent NOT_or NOT_challenge NOT_to NOT_authority NOT_is NOT_crazier NOT_and NOT_more NOT_dangerous NOT_than NOT_any NOT_bushranger . <br /><br />so not NOT_expecting NOT_this NOT_to NOT_be NOT_an NOT_accurate NOT_recreation NOT_of NOT_the NOT_historical NOT_kelly NOT_gang ,  i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie .  it was sentimental and romantic ,  but thankfully not NOT_anywhere NOT_as NOT_cheesy NOT_as NOT_it NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been; NOT_for NOT_my NOT_fellow NOT_australians ,  watch 'the lighthorseman' and you will see what i mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly) .  perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas ,  such as the shooting of the troopers .  ironically ,  i actually enjoyed the movie because of that ,  because it would be those details that most of the focus on ned's story would dwell .  and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians . <br /><br />this movie was always going to have a hard time ,  having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to australians; perhaps a little of ned's spirit is in this movie ,  because i think it rebelled against people's expectations ,  and unfortunately missed both targets .  fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film .  for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned ,  and that is why i liked it .  orlando bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something .  i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf ,  for a change . <br /><br />when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one ,  your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered .  send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime . 
514 0 i love jamie foxx . <br /><br />and i enjoy 99% of all movies i see . <br /><br />and i walked out of this one . <br /><br />now ,  i admit ,  it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing ("oh no ,  jamie's knocking on a door! hee hee hee!") ,  but .  .  .  this was just so incredibly annoying .  there could be no NOT_sustained NOT_camera NOT_shot ,  and no NOT_camera NOT_shot NOT_from NOT_a NOT_conventional NOT_angle .  .  .  everything had to be in-your-face ,  loud ,  and annoying . <br /><br />the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich-like ,  but at this point ,  it's just old and tired .  he brought nothing new or interesting .  from all the characters ,  too many lines you saw coming ,  too many you've heard before ,  and too many "tough guy" lines .  .  .  and i don't NOT_mind NOT_that NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_thing ,  really ,  as long as there's a bit of originality to it .  in fact ,  pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked . <br /><br />i love jamie foxx ,  and i think he's really funny ,  and i thought he was funny in this movie .  .  .  but not NOT_nearly NOT_funny NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_me NOT_to NOT_endure NOT_everything NOT_else .  <br /><br />this movie needed less shoot-em-up ,  less annoying camera shots ,  more emotion ,  more feeling ,  and more jamie foxx .  i gave it a 2 . 
515 1 ***spoilers*** all too ,  in real life as well as in the movies ,  familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun ,  or rifle ,  in their hands .  the case of young and innocent ,  in never NOT_handling NOT_or NOT_firing NOT_a NOT_gun ,  jimmy davis ,  franchot tone ,  has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men ,  like jimmy davis ,  are forced to take up arms for their country . <br /><br />jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay ,  by being belted in the mouth ,  by his good friend fred p .  willis ,  spencer tracy ,  ended up on the front lines in france .  with jimmy's unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple .  it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german ,  who raised his arms in surrender ,  that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him . <br /><br />recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy ,  gladys george .  rose was really in love with jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her .  it's when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose ,  thinking that he was killed ,  fell in love and later married jimmy .  when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy ,  now fully recovered from his wounds ,  was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmy's proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred ,  who's still in love with her ,  a bitter and resentful young man .  it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front .  smug and sure of himself ,  and his ability to shoot a gun ,  jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city's underworld! not NOT_only NOT_that NOT_but NOT_as NOT_fred NOT_later NOT_found NOT_out NOT_his NOT_wife NOT_rose NOT_had NOT_no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_jimmy NOT_was NOT_really NOT_involved NOT_in NOT_with NOT_jimmy NOT_telling NOT_her NOT_that NOT_he NOT_works NOT_as NOT_a NOT_law NOT_abiding NOT_and NOT_inoffensive NOT_insurance NOT_adjuster . <br /><br />jimmy's life of crime came full circle when rose ,  after she found out about his secret life ,  ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a "valentine day" like massacre ,  with his gang members dressed as cops ,  of his rival mobsters .  while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then ,  after his three year sentence is up ,  get his life back together .  <br /><br />***spoiler alert*** hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law .  it's at fred's circus ,  where he works as both manger and barker ,  that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he ,  like at his trial ,  had a sudden change of heart .  but the thought of going back to prison ,  with at least another ten years added on to his sentence ,  was just too much for jimmy! it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job ,  that he himself didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_heart NOT_to NOT_do ,  for him! 
516 0 this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx ,  and i bet it will be my last .  i failed to see why he was funny ,  although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera ,  or for saying "i am going to take a shower" . <br /><br />the plot is completely predictable .  the bad guy comes after the good guy .  the good guy has a woman ,  so the bad guy uses her .  in between ,  the officials screwing up .  the final scenes are utterly unbelievable .  you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy ,  but you don't NOT_do NOT_your NOT_home NOT_work NOT_to NOT_solve NOT_a NOT_trivial NOT_riddle?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>there's NOT_no NOT_great NOT_acting ,  there isn't NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_plot NOT_or NOT_storyline ,  and the shooting is done mtv style .  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_money NOT_on NOT_this NOT_one . <br /><br /> 
517 1 sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracy's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people .  they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them both . <br /><br />tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees ,  tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp ,  but tracy stops him .  tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard ,  younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox .  <br /><br />over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest .  he's learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york .  but alvin c .  york was never NOT_changed NOT_by NOT_the NOT_war NOT_the NOT_way NOT_tone NOT_has . <br /><br />wounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him .  tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going .  later on when tracy is reported missing in action ,  tone and george marry .  tracy's brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage ,  but takes sit in stride .  <br /><br />the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills he's learned to the gangster trade .  he's a hit-man now and george doesn't NOT_really NOT_know NOT_what NOT_he NOT_does NOT_for NOT_a NOT_living .  i think you can figure the rest out . <br /><br />the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i can't NOT_believe NOT_gladys NOT_george NOT_couldn't NOT_figure NOT_it NOT_out .  she's a street smart girl ,  her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagney . <br /><br />speaking of the roaring twenties ,  humphrey bogart's character development there is similar to tone's although he was not NOT_the NOT_central NOT_character NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie .  in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwood's classic ,  the unforgiven .  <br /><br />the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke .  for some reason leonard maltin panned this film ,  i think it's a lot better than he gave it credit . 
518 0 photography was too jumpy to follow .  dark scenes hard to see . <br /><br />had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere .  too noisy for what was really happening bottom line is it's a baddddd movie 
519 1 for a danish movie ,  i have to say ,  that this is very good movie . <br /><br />it's in a class of its own ,  yet it has an international potential . <br /><br />the movie has a big budget ,  and is starring famous danish actors ,  and a few newcomers ,  who play very well .  it can be watched by anyone who like adventures ,  and a little bit of 'ghost' movie . <br /><br />don't be afraid ,  be thrilled! 
520 0 well ,  i can and will be very short .  this is a wrong-balanced ,  non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better .  the script seems to not NOT_know NOT_which NOT_way NOT_to NOT_go NOT_ .  .  .  from funny to cliche-wise serious .  .  .  it's a bit silly .  that plus too much sentences we have heard before "the hacker is in florida ,  or no ,  he is in madrid ,  no NOT_he NOT_is NOT_in NOT_ .  .  .   ,  he is screwing the signal" .  <br /><br />4 out of 10 
521 1 wow! a danish movie with this kind of content? i mean ,  the actors ,  the story ,  the pictures ,  the efx - everything was where it should be .  <br /><br />and a danish efx house producing those vfx - wow! this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality . <br /><br />*spoiler ahead* the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good ,  but generally i did not NOT_feel NOT_the NOT_big NOT_chill NOT_which NOT_i NOT_would NOT_expect NOT_from NOT_a NOT_ghost-movie .  *end of spoiler*<br /><br />but anyway ,  this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud of . <br /><br />the only "bad" about this ,  is that it wasn't NOT_a NOT_danish NOT_director ,  but a swedish .  .  . 
522 0 jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before .  the bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "in the line of fire" .  the cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf .  .  . 
523 1 i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister .  instead ,  i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not NOT_scared .  in many ways still a childrenâ´s story ,  but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential .  could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience . 
524 0 jamie foxx is my favorite comedian .  however ,  i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role .  foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker ,  martin lawrence and dave chapple ,  who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (see: money talks ,  blue streak) . <br /><br />okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles ,  but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream .  or in living color's tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee's satire bamboozled . 
525 1 ***spoilers*** ***spoilers***<br /><br />this movie ,  "the divers" ,  is really interesting .  all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history ,  underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish .  but i decided to check it out for one reason ,  the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine .  i've got a fetish for german subs ,  especially wrecks that can be dived upon .  so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part ,  but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part .  knowing that nordic films aren't NOT_always NOT_that NOT_good NOT_and NOT_not NOT_sure NOT_of NOT_the NOT_budget NOT_size NOT_i NOT_was ,  to say the least ,  very sceptical . <br /><br />upon viewing i was  .  .  .  surprised . <br /><br />i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate ,  seeing how some are very young ,  the two main actors in particular .  this was not NOT_an NOT_issue ,  they both perform very well .  as do the other actors ,  who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond .  this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old ,  not NOT_often NOT_seen NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen .  not NOT_unique NOT_in NOT_anyway ,  but somewhat rare .  and it's all good . <br /><br />as for the danish language ,  it is nearly impossible to understand .  but this was no NOT_problem ,  it had subtitles . <br /><br />another issue was the submarine itself ,  i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine .  having decided their budget was slim ,  i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst .  again i was surprised ,  the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic .  having a fetish for german subs ,  i knew what the sub should look like ,  especially inside ,  and was not NOT_let NOT_down .  the team has done some serious research .  it's all good . <br /><br />i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a "warning" .  the submarine in the movie is not NOT_an NOT_actual NOT_model NOT_that NOT_existed NOT_during NOT_the NOT_war .  it's a special purpose sub .  but to give you a hint of what to expect ,  it's a crossing between a type vii ,  type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i-52 .  it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck . <br /><br />the setting is on a danish island or peninsula ,  i can't NOT_remember .  it's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year .  their grandfather is a mariner of sorts .  the cinematography is quite nice ,  a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks ,  some newfound teenage love ,  nice diving weather and a general feeling of "perfect" .  once again ,  it's all good . <br /><br />plot-wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind ,  a gathering of men hire one of the boats ,  an old minesweeper and it's crew .  one of the visitors ,  a man in his 50's ,  has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back .  the island's senior citizens all remember when a german u-boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths .  the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 .  no NOT_submarine NOT_was NOT_ever NOT_found . <br /><br />what to expect<br /><br />key elements are nazi experiments ,  nazi history ,  treasure hunting ,  secrecy ,  competition ,  teen love ,  conspiracy ,  and  .  .  . a surprise . <br /><br />*** warning - spoiler ***<br /><br />i had not NOT_expected NOT_some NOT_elements NOT_of NOT_the NOT_supernatural NOT_to NOT_appear NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_it NOT_caught NOT_me NOT_off NOT_guard .  not NOT_being NOT_a NOT_big NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_supernatural NOT_events ,  it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no NOT_problem .  it's not NOT_like NOT_"from NOT_dusk NOT_til NOT_dawn" NOT_where NOT_everybody NOT_turns NOT_into NOT_vampires NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_end .  this is a bit more subtle . <br /><br />overall : really good movie ,  i gave it an 8 .  some due to the fact that it isn't NOT_a NOT_hollywood NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_unlimited NOT_resources .  i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans .  but even if this had been a hollywood production ,  i would give it a 7 or 8 .  definately worth your while .  yes ,  a child's story in a way ,  but then again a mature tale .  it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure ,  which i found very appealing .  and ,  again ,  the cinematography is really nice . <br /><br />/medusa 2001<br /><br /> 
526 0 after a day at work ,  i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels .  the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started .  the first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested ,  but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie .  if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting .  all in all ,  don't NOT_plan NOT_on NOT_impressing NOT_your NOT_friends NOT_by NOT_picking NOT_this NOT_one NOT_as NOT_a NOT_renter NOT_for NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_night . 
527 1 this was a strong poirot/suchet ,  television mystery selection .  the characters were vivid and well-acted .  the plot and the main setting--a student hostel-- were excellent .  japp was nothing special but for me did not NOT_distract NOT_from NOT_story .  one significant point ,  many poirot watchers don't NOT_recognize NOT_good NOT_acting NOT_or NOT_good NOT_characterization .  i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries .  finally ,  i have read few christie novels--none in recent years-- and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel .  please ,  viewers ,  consider what is presented to you on film ,  not NOT_what NOT_you NOT_think NOT_should NOT_be NOT_there .  that said ,  the poirot mysteries vary in quality ,  but not NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_reviewers NOT_and NOT_raters NOT_would NOT_have NOT_you NOT_believe .  with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot ,  character and theme ,  the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad .  for the record ,  i have seen all the longer poirot/suchet films .  finally ,  films without lemon ,  hastings ,  and/or japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence .  there presence ,  however ,  is either obtrusive (almost always with japp) or irrelevant with hastings .  lemon is in the middle . 
528 0  .  .  . that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful ,  oscar-winning performance .  one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx's performance in "ray" was because from watching his hammy ,  obnoxious acting in movies like "bait" and "booty call , " i would never NOT_imagine NOT_he NOT_would NOT_ever NOT_hold NOT_the NOT_oscar .  if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar ,  i would laugh right in their faces .  who knows? maybe he's better off sticking to drama ,  because if you watch "bait , " it's clearly evident that comedy is not NOT_his NOT_forte .  i swear ,  jamie mugs so much in this movie that i'm surprised his face didn't NOT_fall NOT_off .  and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn't NOT_require NOT_being NOT_loud NOT_and NOT_obnoxious .  if a joke is funny ,  it's funny .  if it's not NOT_funny ,  then doing some crazy accent is not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_make NOT_it NOT_any NOT_funnier .  the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character .  in real life ,  normal people don't NOT_always NOT_have NOT_witty NOT_comebacks NOT_and NOT_quips .  like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in "taxi driver , " it's important to be funny as your character ,  rather than be funny as a comedian .  a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken ,  and he starts posing for the photographs like a model .  if a regular person were being thrown in jail ,  would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? and wouldn't NOT_the NOT_police NOT_try NOT_to NOT_scold NOT_him NOT_if NOT_he NOT_was? NOT_there NOT_are NOT_many NOT_scenes NOT_like NOT_that NOT_throughout NOT_the NOT_film .  another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain ,  and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent .  not NOT_funny! NOT_not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_jamie NOT_never NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_acknowledge NOT_the NOT_timing NOT_of NOT_a NOT_joke .  giving a comedic performance requires patience ,  whereas he goes straight to the punchline ,  whether it's the right time for it or not .  i'm not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_big NOT_mike NOT_epps NOT_fan ,  but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie's .  as a matter of fact ,  this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen .  epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy ,  but at least he chooses a more low-key approach .  one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse ,  a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains .  he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality .  however ,  fellow "green mile" star doug hutchison is disgustingly over-the-top as the villain .  a big surprise ,  considering he gave a superb performance in "the green mile , " also playing a heavy .  antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like "the replacement killers" and "training day . " even in "bait , " he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence .  his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx ,  who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another .  unless you're a die-hard fan of foxx ,  please don't NOT_take NOT_the NOT_bait . 
529 1 hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery .  i confess i have not NOT_read NOT_the NOT_book ,  despite being an avid agatha christie fan .  the adaptation isn't NOT_without NOT_its NOT_problems ,  there were times when the humour ,  and there were valiant attempts to get it right ,  was a little overdone ,  and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed .  i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded .  however ,  i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed ,  it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders ,  and it really set the atmosphere ,  what with the dark camera work and dark lighting .  the darker moments were somewhat creepy ,  this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation ,  maybe not NOT_as NOT_disturbing NOT_as NOT_the NOT_one NOT_in NOT_one NOT_two NOT_buckle NOT_my NOT_shoe ,  which gave me nightmares .  the plot is complex ,  with all the essential ingredients ,  though not NOT_as NOT_convoluted NOT_as NOT_buckle NOT_my NOT_shoe , and in some way that is a good thing .  the acting was very good ,  david suchet is impeccable(i know i can't NOT_use NOT_this NOT_word NOT_forever NOT_but NOT_i NOT_can't NOT_think NOT_of NOT_a NOT_better NOT_word NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_his NOT_performance NOT_in NOT_the NOT_series) NOT_as NOT_poirot ,  and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly .  and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole ,  particularly damian lewis as leonard .  all in all ,  solid mystery but doesn't NOT_rank NOT_along NOT_the NOT_best .  7 . 5/10 bethany cox 
530 0 the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i've put the spoiler warning up because i'm unsure if i'm giving anything away .  the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago .  then we're up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house .  we're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror .  some 105 year old woman lived there .  there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den .  an old fashioned straight-razor falls out when they're renovating and the husband keeps it .  i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams .  oh yeah ,  the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks .  <br /><br />some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person .  late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money & the husband murders the body guard & a co-worker and steals the money .  his wife is suddenly pregnant .  <br /><br />what the hell is going on?? who knows?? nothing is explained .  was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer? the baby sister? why were iron panels put on the wall? how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar? was he locked down there by his family & starved to death or just concealed? who is mr .  hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels?? he's never NOT_seen NOT_again .  why was the serial killer killing people? we only see the one old man murdered .  was there a pattern or motive or something?? why does the wife suddenly become pregnant? is it the demon spawn of the serial killer? has he managed to infiltrate the husband's semen? and why ,  if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge ,  burly security guard ,  is he unable to overpower his wife? and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire? and why does the wife stay in the house? is she now possessed by the serial killer? is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated? <br /><br />this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back! the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time ,  but even that couldn't redeem this muddled ,  incoherent mess . 
531 1 a series of random ,  seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister's boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated .  a ring ,  light bulbs ,  a rucksack ,  a lighter ,  a stethoscope ,  a shoe â– there seems to be no NOT_rhyme NOT_or NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_any NOT_of NOT_it .  miss lemon asks her employer ,  the great belgian detective hercule poirot ,  to look into the matter .  but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined .  and poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered .  it's up to poirot to bring a killer to justice . <br /><br />hickory dickory dock is a solid ,  but not NOT_spectacular ,  entry in the long running poirot series .  i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christie's original story .  i realize that certain liberties had to be taken ,  but i appreciate the effort nonetheless .  the major points of the mystery are all there â– the petty thefts ,  the boarding house ,  the students ,  the ripped rucksack ,  and ,  of course ,  poirot's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens .  with a few exceptions ,  the cast of students is almost as i pictured them .  damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group .  as mush as i always enjoy david suchet's poirot ,  i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jackson's inspector japp and pauline moran's miss lemon .  this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual .  finally ,  i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel .  it's a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock title . <br /><br />i realized while re-watching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christie's work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films ,  or gialli ,  of the 60s and 70s .  take the murder of mrs .  nicoletis as an example .  if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene ,  you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo .  in fact ,  the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo .  it's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked .

534 0 the episodic version of robert heinlein's starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace ,  following johnny rico leaving his parents ,  the (not very attractive) girl he lusts for ,  and joining the mobile infantry .  the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film ,  instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths . <br /><br />throughout watching this version ,  i was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing .  the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits ,  and the aching ,  prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors ,  with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes .  in terms of construction ,  it owes a debt to top gun ,  sharing much in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies) . 
535 1 it all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on hickory road ,  london .  concerned for her sister ,  who is the housekeeper there ,  miss lemon asks hercule poirot to look into the matter .  he agrees ,  but soon the stakes get higher when a girl ,  who had admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the thefts ,  is found murdered . <br /><br />"hickory dickory dock" is a solid brain exercise ,  without being as mind-numbingly complicated as "one ,  two ,  buckle my shoe" .  murder ,  theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved ,  and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! the characters are interesting ,  particularly the psychology student colin mcnabb and the mysterious american girl sally finch ,  inspector japp has his funny moments (in perhaps the closest this series has come to "toilet humor") ,  and miss lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual .

536 0 1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes? did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth ,  in different time frames (attilla the hun wasn't NOT_a NOT_contemporary NOT_of NOT_preliterate NOT_hellenic NOT_cultures ,  nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders) speak different languages and can never NOT_develop NOT_a NOT_language NOT_so NOT_similar NOT_to NOT_modern NOT_day NOT_english(except NOT_for NOT_the NOT_inflections NOT_they NOT_"do NOT_not" NOT_use) ,  which has been influenced by latin ,  ancient greek ,  danish and french? <br /><br />2 cultural differences can't NOT_be NOT_overcome NOT_so NOT_easily ,  trust has to be won ,  yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders .  of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods .  the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like . <br /><br />3 historical background: none .  visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture ,  but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part .  a small-town theater group probably has better props . <br /><br />4 boring! another lame canuck production ,  which inexplicably ran for ten long years .  as a kids show it could make the grade ,  but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1 ,  like i just did .  i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci-fi show ,  otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes! 
537 1 i loved dedee pfeiffer (is that spelled right?) in cybil .  haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her .  i thought she did a great job in this .  the supporting cast was pretty good too .  in some angles ,  the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman .  the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists .  the young boyfriend was a hottie .  i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure . <br /><br />just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies .  kept my interest and i'll watch it again when they rerun it .  can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this? you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want .  thanks in advance .  aboutagirly . 
538 0 having seen the first ten episodes ,  i must say this show sucks .  <br /><br />what bothers me the most ,  is that the show was shot in canada .  i know it's cheaper ,  but they should have shot it in california ,  so we could have had scenes in the desert .  that would have been more true to the movie .  the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains ,  with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold .  that does'nt feel very egyptian .  what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt .  here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest .  and it's so lame that appaerantly ,  on other planets ,  the fall comes as well .  you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver .  it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb .  <br /><br />and then there is richard dean anderson .  he is no NOT_kurt NOT_russel .  sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit ,  but he is just not NOT_as NOT_cool NOT_as NOT_russel .  and not NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_good NOT_an NOT_actor NOT_as NOT_russel .  and russells way of playing o neill ,  well he was much more cynical .  andersons o neil ,  is way too soft .  i liked it that russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no NOT_trouble NOT_detonating NOT_the NOT_bomb NOT_until NOT_the NOT_very NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie .  <br /><br />michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader . <br /><br />teal'c is a really annoying character .  he is jaffa .  not NOT_a NOT_jaffa .  just jaffa .  aaaarrgh!! a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character ,  seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far .  teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot .  i've seen better acting from jean claude van damme . <br /><br />and the fact that teal'c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie ,  can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb .  what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters .  <br /><br />as for the special effects ,  they are really good in the pilot .  but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap .  especially a planet they visit with crystals .  it's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background .  it's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap .  especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds .  <br /><br />the x-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993 .  that was 4 years before sg-1 started .  and they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode ,  that sg-1 supposedly had .  they must have spend all the money on catering .  because i don't NOT_see NOT_it NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen .  <br /><br />incredibly boring and pointless show ,  that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters . 
539 1 i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones .  the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didn't NOT_see NOT_coming NOT_before NOT_each NOT_commercial .  to me it was kind of like medium meets csi . <br /><br />did anyone else think that in certain lights ,  the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman? are they related in any way? i'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video . <br /><br />dedee was great .  haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly . <br /><br />if you're into to tv mystery movies ,  check this one out if you have a chance . 
540 0 im watching it now on pink (serbia tv station) and i must say this is a crap .  shallow ,  no NOT_acting ,  effects too sloppy i mean ,  who made this series?<br /><br />this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film .  ok .  the film was great in 1994 when it came out .  but the series?<br /><br />some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters .  i mean ,  did they actually pay someone to write that ,  was that someones relative at the studio? this is no NOT_scifi . <br /><br />the film was the bomb ,  the series suck . 
541 1 i have to say ,  seventeen & missing is much better than i expected .  the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery . <br /><br />dedee pfeiffer is emilie ,  a mom who insists her daughter ,  lori (tegan moss) ,  not NOT_attend NOT_a NOT_so-called NOT_graduation NOT_party NOT_one NOT_weeknight ,  but lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway .  when lori does not NOT_come NOT_home ,  emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance . <br /><br />seventeen & missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type ,  as it is not NOT_so NOT_predictable .  pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie ,  and most of it comes off as believable .  this lmn original movie premiered last night .  10/10 
542 0 i cannot believe how popular this show is .  i consider myself an avid sci-fi fan .  i have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and tv shows .  i really wouldn't NOT_even NOT_consider NOT_this NOT_true NOT_sci-fi .  every episode i have sat through was like a lame ,  watered down version of a star trek episode ,  minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting . <br /><br />it's basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues ,  talking about something boring ,  who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth ,  with people who look and sound just like humans! it seemed extremely low budget .  the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts ,  and the many attempts at humor fall flat .  it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it ,  trying to be funny ,  but he is not .  it is just sad . <br /><br />the movie was terrible as well .  there is so much you can do with a portal through space ,  yet every place the army people go is boring! this shows no NOT_imagination! NOT_i NOT_actually NOT_thought NOT_the NOT_tv NOT_series NOT_"alien NOT_nation" NOT_from NOT_a NOT_few NOT_years NOT_back NOT_(based NOT_on NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_alien NOT_nation) NOT_was NOT_much NOT_better .  that show actually had good story lines and decent characters .  i wasn't NOT_crazy NOT_about NOT_"alien NOT_nation" ,  but compared to this overrated crap ,  it was great!<br /><br />also ,  unlike the great new "battlestar galactica" series ,  "stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! they should have at least updated the cheesy "toilet flushing" special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate .

544 0 when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television .  we've all been guilty of it at some time or another ,  but my excuse for watching things like "buck rogers in the 25th century" and "silver spoons" is this: i was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile . <br /><br />thankfully ,  i now appreciate the good stuff .  stargate sg-1 is not NOT_good .  the 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it ,  every line of stilted dialogue ,  every bit of needless technobabble .  the writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek: voyager .  if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever ,  you're in trouble . <br /><br />the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure ,  anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell ,  full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture ,  a wonderful musical score ,  and cool sci-fi ideas .  with the exception of a little of the original music ,  none of what made the film fun appears in this show .  even richard dean anderson ,  who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting ,  seems like he's half asleep most episodes . <br /><br />the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement .  the cinematography isn't NOT_much NOT_better ,  as vanilla and dull as the scripts .  it amazes me that shows with a lot more style (like farscape) and substance (like the reimagined battlestar galactica) have smaller ,  less rabid fanbases than this pap .  it just doesn't NOT_deserve NOT_it . 
545 1 loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager . the movie ,  was presented well ,  with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing .  many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter .  the progression of situations were cleverly written , making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious .  too bad there have to be commercials . i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again . i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue .  husband and wife heated discussions(or should i say fights?) were very realistic . the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not . i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film .  thank you! looking forward to the next films---when? whidbey 
546 0 the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine .  this movie is no NOT_cabarnet NOT_and NOT_certainly NOT_no NOT_casablanca .  i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy .  but let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie . <br /><br />with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom .  since watch on the rhine ,  author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story "julia" from her book "pentimento" .  as one of the most odious of a plethora of western-based ussr apologists ,  it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists ,  who had just proved their military superiority in spain . <br /><br />as one reviewer correctly noted ,  this is not NOT_a NOT_pro-american NOT_play NOT_and NOT_movie ,  as lillian went to her grave an american-loathing communist .  this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then ,  just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america . 
547 1 it's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does .  she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress .  that notwithstanding ,  yes ,  the plot was predictable .  i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was ,  which would have added more to the suspense .  it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard's little problem with his ex-wife ,  maybe a bit more back story .  i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie .  i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack's death and possibly closure with her husband .  i do have to say though ,  i will never NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_look NOT_at NOT_a NOT_flare NOT_gun NOT_and NOT_not NOT_picture NOT_her NOT_standing NOT_there .  it was a very fitting end for richard .  of course ,  mitzi rocked! i am so looking forward to her future projects . 
548 0 there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned .  one either likes it very much ,  applauding its sincerity ,  its liberal point of view and fine acting ,  or else loathes its obvious propaganda ,  mediocre dialogue ,  cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness .  i fall very much in the latter category ,  and found the film and play , --concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime--a crushing bore ,  worthwhile mostly for the acting ,  and even then only intermittently .  that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant .  her plays were written for people who shared her point of view ,  and she seldom explored ideas that weren't NOT_already NOT_held NOT_by NOT_the NOT_author NOT_and NOT_audience NOT_except NOT_to NOT_point NOT_out NOT_how NOT_dreadful NOT_the NOT_"other NOT_side" NOT_is .  even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say , --as in rhine--i still can't NOT_stand NOT_the NOT_way NOT_she NOT_says NOT_it .  her characters are unreal ,  and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no NOT_real NOT_brilliance NOT_or NOT_originality .  she really had nothing new to say .  i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy's long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago .  for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days ,  i urge a peek at watch on the rhine ,  as bad in its way as angels in america ,  which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago . 
549 1 i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because ,  frankly ,  i love the guy ,  even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie (long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick) .  it's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot (but then most movies these days aren't NOT_exactly NOT_original) ,  but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband ,  martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter ,  and mitzi kapture does a good job ,  if that was her goal ,  of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like .  nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis .  however ,  too much of the plot takes place off-screen -- like motivation ,  prior behaviors ,  good times and bad times -- and things that seem apparent to the characters never NOT_quite NOT_make NOT_it NOT_to NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_(i . e .  ,  me) .  the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "but what about .  .  . " category ,  and overall ,  i can't NOT_say NOT_that NOT_i NOT_cared NOT_much NOT_about NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters .  that being said ,  it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and i still like nick . 
550 0 it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not NOT_preachy .  it is not NOT_only NOT_oppressively NOT_preachy ,  but absurd ,  stagebound ,  dramatically straight-jacketed ,  and painfully overwrought .  watching it ,  one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write "i will not NOT_become NOT_a NOT_fascist" NOT_on NOT_the NOT_blackboard NOT_100 NOT_times . <br /><br />now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2 ,  and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about ,  (which anyone would whole-heartedly applaud) and i'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day .  but it is presented in such an immature ,  over-obvious ,  sledgehammer way ,  it fails abysmally as a work of art . <br /><br />the only good performances here are from paul lukas ,  who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist; and lucile watson as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become .  though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships ,  the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snips .  they do not NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_resemble NOT_real NOT_human NOT_beings .  and bette davis ,  a great actress ,  here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen .  her every word ,  her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for ,  that she must've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal . <br /><br />so yes ,  this is a very important film ,  just not NOT_a NOT_very NOT_good NOT_one . 
551 1 this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac (olivia dunne) was very much in love with joe macleod , (zack) .  the mother is played by mitzi kapture , (jill dunne) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface .  jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often .  there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs .  in many ways ,  olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancuso , (richard grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner .  this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror .  enjoy 
552 0 the characters are cliched and predictable ,  with everyone being either snow-white pure or wholly evil .  the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing ,  over-the-top way .  it's doubly disappointing if you're a bette davis fan ,  because her character is not NOT_a NOT_typically NOT_fun NOT_bette-davis-type NOT_character; NOT_she NOT_just NOT_gets NOT_to NOT_frown NOT_pensively NOT_a NOT_lot . <br /><br />on the whole ,  neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting ,  moving or enjoyable at all . 
553 1 when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing ,  you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work .  undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay .  speaking of gameplay ,  the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience .  the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game .  the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision .  the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you . 
554 0 lillian hellman's play ,  adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman ,  becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros .  paul lukas ,  reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar ,  plays an anti-nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists ,  dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states (via the mexico border) .  they settle in washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother ,  though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker .  it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus ,  and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise ,  honest ,  direct refugees teaching the clueless ,  head-in-the-sand americans how the world has suddenly changed) ,  it seems a little patronizing--the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place ,  being lectured to .  lukas has several speeches in the third-act which undoubtedly won him the academy award ,  yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit ,  enter and exit .  as his spouse ,  bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage ,  but the role doesn't NOT_allow NOT_her NOT_much NOT_color .  their children (all with divergent accents!) are alternately humorous and annoying ,  and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put-upon wife (and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong) .  the intent here was to tastefully ,  tactfully show us just because a (wwii-era) man may be german ,  that doesn't NOT_make NOT_him NOT_a NOT_nazi NOT_sympathizer .  we get that in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful ,  tactful movie is made up of exposition ,  defensive confrontation and ,  ultimately ,  compassion .  it should be a heady mix ,  but instead it's rather dry-eyed and inert .  ** from **** 
555 1 not NOT_being NOT_a NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_first NOT_person NOT_shooters NOT_i NOT_was NOT_very NOT_hesitant NOT_to NOT_play NOT_this NOT_game .  after having played the demo however i was sold .  "undying" really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in .  you have this green amulet , called the "gel'ziabar stone" that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at .  with a special spell "the scrye" you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you .  walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper:" look" , with the stone glowing at for example a painting .  and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting .  let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell .  people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats .  this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around .  because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark .  and ghosts and monster appear at random when you don't NOT_expect NOT_them NOT_and NOT_can NOT_kill NOT_you NOT_very NOT_quickly .  there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened .  this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic "evil dead"! to experience something like this is a real accomplishment .  there are a lot of elements that take "undying" to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced .  but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws .  for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge .  you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden , secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called "oneiros" .  that is all fine in the beginning .  but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating .  and there is no NOT_map .  the game demands you memorize your surroundings .  so patience is required .  also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you can't NOT_progress .  i don't NOT_mind NOT_jumping NOT_on NOT_platforms NOT_in NOT_third NOT_person NOT_adventures .  but in first person mode that can be an annoying task .  luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace .  and trust me you will need it .  overall "undying" is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan . 
556 0 i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel .  "i'm thinking matrix ,  i'm thinking bladerunner ,  i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel ,  wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her ,  leave that one with us .  only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot ,  dialogue ,  character ,  decent action or budget ,  just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike .  fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes ,  right?"<br /><br />flashy ,  shallow ,  dreary ,  formulaic ,  passionless ,  tedious ,  dull ,  dumb ,  humourless ,  desultory ,  barely competent .  live action anime without any action ,  or indeed any life .  sf just the way joe fanboy likes it ,  in fact .  :( 
557 1 i gotta say ,  clive barker's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made .  i've played resident evil ,  silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements .  barker is good at what he does ,  which is attach the horror to our world ,  and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game .  heck ,  even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters .  full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at ,  undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title .  i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud . 
558 0 wow ,  here it finally is; the action "movie" without action .  in a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood . <br /><br />there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies ,  mainly "matrix" without having the money to do it right .  yes ,  we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx . ) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then . <br /><br />and ,  yes ,  we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere ,  as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes . <br /><br />believe me ,  it is as bad as it possibly can get .  in fact ,  it doesn't NOT_deserve NOT_to NOT_be NOT_taken NOT_seriously ,  but perhaps i can make some of you not NOT_rent NOT_it NOT_and NOT_save NOT_your NOT_money . 
559 1 i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it .  the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit ,  its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not NOT_really NOT_there .  the sound effects and audio are amazing .  there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not .  you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic .  the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you .  if you want to get the full experience ,  try playing it with head phones on . 
560 0 god ,  i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot .  i had been expecting a lot from it ,  as i'm a huge fan of james cameron (and not NOT_just NOT_since NOT_"titanic" ,  i might add) ,  and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality (then again ,  he also wrote the leaden strange days .  . ) .  but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration .  in all that time ,  it barely went beyond its two line synopsis ,  and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere .  on top of that ,  i don't NOT_think NOT_the NOT_acrobatics NOT_outdid NOT_even NOT_those NOT_of NOT_any NOT_regular NOT_"a-team" NOT_episode .  as for alba ,  yes ,  she is gorgeous ,  of course ,  but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly) ,  makes me also get bored of her "gal wit an attitude" schtick pretty soon .  you can count me out of this one ,  mr .  cameron! 
561 1 undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups .  it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena .  the game is set in ireland after world war one so don't NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_find NOT_weapons NOT_like NOT_chainguns NOT_or NOT_rocket NOT_launchers . all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on . our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left . so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game! the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p . c .  . level design is also cool and atmospheric .  mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress .  thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not NOT_excellent .  but the game has two main flaws .  first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration . secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not NOT_appeal NOT_to NOT_most NOT_fps NOT_players NOT_who NOT_are NOT_used NOT_to NOT_high NOT_tech NOT_weaponry .  as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced .  most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not NOT_frustratingly NOT_difficult .  overall undying is a great game .  definitely one of the best fps out there . 
562 0 awful ,  simply awful .  it proves my theory about "star power . " this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed (battlestar) titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick .  b o r i n g . <br /><br />find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no NOT_picture NOT_and NOT_no NOT_sound .  1/10 (i rated it so high b/c there aren't NOT_any NOT_negative NOT_scores NOT_in NOT_the NOT_imdb . com rating system . )<br /><br />-zaphoid<br /><br />ps: my theory about "star power" is: the more "star power" used in a show ,  the weaker the show is .  (it's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1/"star power" ,  less "sp" makes for better quality ,  etc .  another way to look at it is: "more is less . ")<br /><br />-z 
563 1 this game was really great and quite a challenge .  it has a great ,  spooky story line and the graphics are also very good .  i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish .  the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me . <br /><br /> a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans . <br /><br />> 
564 0 what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe .  during the first season ,  dark angel was on my weekly "must see" list ,  and not NOT_just NOT_because NOT_of NOT_jessica NOT_alba . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to "fine-tune" the plotline .  within 3 episodes of the season opener ,  they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see jessica alba!) .  i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish .  the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin .  on one of the second season episodes ,  they even had max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep . <br /><br />the moral of the story (the one that hollywood never NOT_gets): NOT_if NOT_it NOT_works ,  don't NOT_screw NOT_with NOT_it!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>azjazz 
565 1 this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played .  it's not NOT_the NOT_average NOT_shoot-everything-that-moves NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_fps NOT_(which NOT_i NOT_usually NOT_don't NOT_care NOT_much NOT_for) ,  but the acceptable gfx ,  interesting weapons and magic ,  great surround soundeffects ("scryeeee ,  scryeeee .  . ") and above all incredible atmosphere .  i love the scrye ,  which enables you ,  at certain places in the games ,  to see or hear events that happened there in the past .  the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere .  i'm a great horror fan ,  escpecially of clive barker's stories and movies ,  and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story .  9/10 (-1 because i'm no NOT_fps NOT_fan ,  and perhaps the game was a bit short?) 
566 0 to movie , this movie felt like one of those after school specials , only lower budget and lower everything else . i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort , but it didn't NOT_work NOT_for NOT_me . yet some how it comes across as preachy . it has very pale shades of flash dance , but so what?there just isn't NOT_any NOT_excitement NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie . the dialogue is contrived and clichã©d to death . of course , the whole movie feels like a bad 80's clichã© . the acting was less than stellar , though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given(or in this case-not)to work with . on top of that is the poor song choices , with really bad lyrics . i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved . they are all talented , but you can't NOT_tell NOT_from NOT_this NOT_movie . this is just my opinion of course , but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 1/10 
567 1 "the days" is a typical family drama with a little catch - you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show . <br /><br />[possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show]<br /><br />the story ,  obviously ,  for all the people who has watched the show ,  is the world of cooper day ,  the middle child of the family .  he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations .  his family includes a mother ,  a father ,  a perfect sister ,  and a genius-little-brother .  the first episode ,  which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation - both the sister and mother gets pregnant .  that's the first situation the writer hits .  then the father quits his job at the law firm .  the youngest son gets a panic attack .  the middle child gets in a fight with the sister's boyfriend .  this is all in a day's work . <br /><br />[/spoilers]<br /><br />i admire this show .  i don't NOT_know .  it's a bit crappy but i like it .  first i thought the camera-work was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it .  i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light .  i liked the intimate feeling of the show .  i liked the low-budget style .  i liked the acting .  i admire the story .  then i find myself wanting a second season of the days .  i slowly became a fan of it as the 6-episode airing on abc came to an end .  it's a really good show and it's nothing like the oc .  the two have nothing in common .  so i hope fans will stop comparing them . <br /><br />and if you can relate to either abby ,  jack ,  natalie ,  cooper or even nate ,  you'll like this show .  a lot . 
568 0 i only today ,  picked this up at the 99 cents only store today ,  and i still think i got ripped off .  "dream to believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin' expensive for this .  this film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1 .  it has a young keanu reeves .  and 2 .  it's directed by paul lynch ,  the man who also did promo night .  now onto the movie .  <br /><br />it's about a girl named robin (played by olivia d'abo) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life .  so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments ,  she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy (played by keanu . ) robin ,  when not NOT_in NOT_training ,  works part-time ,  along with her mother and stepsister ,  at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather .  eventually she is chosen to compete .  <br /><br />overall ,  keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star ,  and it's also not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_movies NOT_ever ,  but still far from good .  the dvd itself is not NOT_getting NOT_any NOT_medals NOT_either NOT_as NOT_it NOT_appears NOT_to NOT_be NOT_sourced NOT_from NOT_an NOT_old NOT_vhs NOT_and NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_end ,  the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over ,  it fades to black ,  even though sound can still be heard .  so this can probably be passed as a bootleg .  the dvd artwork makes no NOT_sense NOT_either NOT_as NOT_it NOT_has NOT_what NOT_appears NOT_to NOT_be NOT_recent NOT_photos NOT_of NOT_keanu NOT_and NOT_olivia NOT_and NOT_the NOT_background NOT_has NOT_nothing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_movie ,  as it's also not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_itself ,  so the cover's obviously photoshopped .  in any case ,  avoid at all costs ,  unless you're a keanu fanatic .  i probably won't NOT_be NOT_hanging NOT_to NOT_it NOT_any NOT_longer .  i'm probably gonna give it to the cinema snob ,  who's a great yt critic btw .  hey ,  if any of you have any crappy movies that they no NOT_longer NOT_want NOT_in NOT_their NOT_sight ,  feel free to donate to him to keep his show running . 
569 1 the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today .  yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other .  their problems were real ,  and it really drew you into the show .  the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives .  the family consisted of abby day (mum) ,  jack day (dad) ,  natalie day (sporty daughter) ,  cooper day (outsider son) ,  and nathan day (boy genius son) .  each episodes a day of their life ,  with coopers perspective on things throughout it .  i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great .  he was by far my favorite character .  it ended with so many things it could've continued with ,  i'm really sad another season wasn't NOT_made .  it was a great show i'm gonna miss it .

571 1 i would just like to say ,  that no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_low NOT_budget NOT_the NOT_film NOT_is ,  it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies .  we don't NOT_read NOT_that NOT_much NOT_anymore ,  instead people want to see movies .  having this series out on dvd ,  has made me want to read the whole series ,  and want more .  please make all 8 movies .  please don't NOT_change NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_either ,  it ruins the effect .  because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters .  please make all 8 movies .  i want to see the message ,  and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray .  we don't NOT_get NOT_that NOT_enough NOT_anymore .  awesome job!!! 
572 0 what an insult to olivia d'abo who plays the film's heroine ,  robin ,  to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film (and at least on recent reissues ,  to have only reeves appear on the box) ,  considering that she was the star .  i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long-forgotten after school special ,  but at least give the woman some credit .  <br /><br />despite that ,  this has to be one of the worst teen sports-themed films that i have ever seen ,  and it strives very hard to add not NOT_only NOT_every NOT_teen NOT_and NOT_sports NOT_movie NOT_clichã© NOT_from NOT_the NOT_class NOT_warfare NOT_between NOT_the NOT_feuding NOT_gymnasts NOT_to NOT_the NOT_teen NOT_romance .  and ,  in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance (with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael sembello's notable 'maniac' which was made famous by flashdance ,  or was it the other way around?) .  it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet ,  even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance-offs between the heroine and her antagonist(s) ,  the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team .  we saw this in trashin' (a vert ramp joust) and rad (bmx dancing at the prom ,  although it wasn't NOT_much NOT_for NOT_competition ,  but rather for fun) for example .  in fact ,  this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness ,  such as the somewhat homo-erotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team . <br /><br />nonetheless ,  the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background .  to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible ,  she lives with her ailing mother ,  her obnoxious sister ,  and her careless (and slightly abusive) stepfather .  needless to say ,  homelife is not NOT_so NOT_appealing .  add to the mix ,  a talent for gymnastics ,  but several obstacles to joining the team (including the nuisance of her arrogant ,  snobby teammates ,  and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well) .  and ,  of course ,  we can't NOT_forget NOT_that NOT_she's NOT_got NOT_eyes NOT_for NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_pretty NOT_boy NOT_preppies NOT_who NOT_is NOT_dating NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_obnoxious NOT_teammates ,  nor that she doesn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_steady NOT_boyfriend NOT_(although NOT_keanu NOT_as NOT_tommy NOT_later NOT_enters NOT_the NOT_picture) .  could this kid be any more pathetic? and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long ,  redundant ,  and clichã©d quest to prove her worth to everyone . <br /><br />but ,  even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film ,  are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog .  (i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance-off to scold the teammates) .  it makes episodes of 'amazing stories' look like shakespeare . <br /><br />i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor .  for that you might be satisfied ,  but it is also an incredibly forced drama .  so ,  caveat emptour . 
573 1 i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad .  .  .  . i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies .  if you are not NOT_a NOT_person NOT_that NOT_enjoyed NOT_the NOT_waltons NOT_or NOT_little NOT_house .  .  . u will not NOT_understand NOT_nor NOT_enjoy NOT_these NOT_movies .  .  . <br /><br />now about loves abiding joy .  .  . i knew he was bad news from the start of the movie .  .  .  . i wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it .  this movie has a lot to do with jeff .  .  .  . it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girls . <br /><br />i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far .  .  .  . was not NOT_crazy NOT_about NOT_the NOT_books .  .  . cant wait until the next movie .  the way clark talks will get you every time .  i would love to see january jones do an appearance .  .  . maybe a family reunion or something . 
574 0 as an altman fan ,  i'd sought out this movie for years ,  thinking that with such a great cast ,  it would have to be at least marginally brilliant . <br /><br />big mistake . <br /><br />this is one of altman's big-cast mishmashes ,  thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room .  it doesn't . <br /><br />as maltin points out ,  this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of alfre woodard ,  who outshines the vets all around her .  but other than that ,  avoid at all costs .

575 1 we loved the movie .  i am a mother to two little men .  i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character .  moveis where money is not NOT_the NOT_most NOT_important NOT_thing .  and family's are forever and love means more then words .  <br /><br />i do wish we saw more of the davis family .  but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did "please don't NOT_be NOT_over" .  we both wish actors would not NOT_change . the new actors were good replacement tho . <br /><br />my 9 year old son loved this movie too .  asked me to go buy them all .  he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something .  family should all see this move buy it for friends  .  help bring back a time of values .  we will be reading the books now that we are hooked .  really hope to see more .  be blessed happy moving 
576 0 there was nothing of value in the original movie ,  this one was even lamer .  the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing .  anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! so what was the story line? what was with the girl? was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film .  sadly ,  i tried several times to watch this .  i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback .  kid said it was stupid ,  and he was four years old .  i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director ,  as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film .  that might be pushing it .  i did love the theme song .  good thing it was only a dollar ,  it was worth it .  i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be .  is pot legal in france? 
577 1 this movie was so great! i am a teenager ,  and i and my friends all love the series ,  so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds .  i recommend it to everyone .  my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says: "rosy cheeks" ,  when he is talking about his baby daughter .  he is such a great actor ,  as well as erin cottrell .  they pair up so well ,  and have such a great chemistry! i really hope that they can work again together .  they are such attractive people ,  and are very good actors .  i have finally found movies that are good to watch .  lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good ,  and show good morals ,  and christian values .  but at the same time ,  these movies aren't NOT_cheesy . 
578 0 what made the original killer tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no NOT_budget NOT_who NOT_were NOT_just NOT_being NOT_wacky NOT_for NOT_a NOT_couple NOT_of NOT_days .  .  . <br /><br />this was something with a budget ,  but it just wasn't NOT_as NOT_much NOT_fun .  john astin of adams family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic ,  but he is supported by lame actors ,  cheap special effects and unfunny gags . <br /><br />the plot .  dr .  gangrene (astin) escapes from a french prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of france .  .  .  the hero ,  his french girlfriend and the gizmo-like "fuzzy tomato" decide they are going to stop him .  .  . <br /><br />forgettable direct to video nonsense .  .  . 
579 1 i love all of the movies by michael landon jr .  and michael landon jr's casting of dale midkiff as "clark davis"could not NOT_of NOT_been NOT_any NOT_better .  dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this character . <br /><br />this movie kept me spellbound from start to finish . <br /><br />the death of missie & willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing .  how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love . <br /><br />although there are 3 movies before this one [ love comes softly  ,  loves enduring promise & loves long journey] ,  i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily .  yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them . <br /><br />michael landon jr .  is an excellent director<br /><br />i look forward to many more movies from him in the future . 
580 0 killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you either love it or hate it .  i personally like it ,  but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone .  the tomatoes aren't NOT_the NOT_same ,  jokes are lame ,  even the actors aren't NOT_as NOT_funny .  because that's the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be - funny . <br /><br />so now following the plot made to laugh ,  is annoying .  they really shouldn't have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy . 
581 1 edmund burke said that "all evil needs is for good me to do nothing . " hollywood often gives us trash because not NOT_enough NOT_families NOT_go NOT_to NOT_see NOT_quality NOT_films .  this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith .  it had no NOT_violence ,  no NOT_lewdness ,  and did not NOT_deserve NOT_a NOT_pg NOT_rating .  the western scenery was filmed well ,  and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking .  actors were a bit young for their parts ,  but otherwise believable and talented .  music score was too loud ,  and in some places drowned out the dialog completely .  i'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more ,  but i was pleasantly surprised by this one .  sometimes the good guys do win ,  and they win by honest efforts .  we liked the movie and the message ,  and would recommend it for the entire family . 
582 0 film version of sandra bernhard's one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious .  sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars ,  but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting ,  and fitfully funny .  her fans will say she's scathingly honest ,  and that may be true .  but she's also shrill ,  with an unapologetic ,  in-your-face bravado that isn't NOT_well-suited NOT_to NOT_a NOT_film NOT_in NOT_this NOT_genre .  she doesn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_make NOT_nice--and NOT_she's NOT_certainly NOT_not NOT_out NOT_to NOT_make NOT_friends--and NOT_that's NOT_always NOT_going NOT_to NOT_rub NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_people NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_way .  but even if you meet her halfway ,  her material here is seriously lacking .  filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and ,  though not NOT_directed NOT_by NOT_him ,  the film does have his chilly ,  detached signature style all over it .  bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share .  *1/2 from ****

584 0 i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered .  the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered through . <br /><br />the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line ,  just one scene ,  that is even worth a chuckle . <br /><br />she is a much better singer than i remember her to be ,  but i didn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_a NOT_lounge NOT_act . <br /><br />i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't NOT_view NOT_it NOT_objectively . 
585 1 okay ,  first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free! first - this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d .  it is for the most part ,  but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d! what!!?!?! it's not NOT_that NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_film NOT_in NOT_a NOT_car!!! NOT_second NOT_- NOT_the NOT_story NOT_isn't NOT_very NOT_good .  there are a lot of things wrong with it . <br /><br />third - why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! watch it for a good laugh  ,  but don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_buying NOT_it .  just download it or something for cheap . 
586 0 this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation .  on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on .  the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved .  she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened .  the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer .  then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell .  the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can't NOT_put NOT_two NOT_and NOT_two NOT_together NOT_much NOT_less NOT_some NOT_lousy NOT_detective NOT_work NOT_at NOT_that .  the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind .  this movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "blood song" with frankie avalon staring in it ,  the same motive just a different character part .  it's not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_worth NOT_renting NOT_not NOT_even NOT_for NOT_an NOT_80's NOT_low-budget NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_the NOT_ending NOT_was NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_ending NOT_i NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_it NOT_left NOT_me NOT_wanting NOT_my NOT_money NOT_back! 
587 1 what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on? and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal . <br /><br />but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense .  you can see real people behind the unreal lines .  and the directing is wonderful .  each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long . <br /><br />i showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie .  the friends enjoyed it too . 
588 0 shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho .  (i'm leaning toward rip off . ) after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better ,  almost to the point of being original .  bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story ,  but the film already surpasses many in the "yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks" genre because it is actually shot in the south . <br /><br />a group of college girls head to ft .  lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road .  (note to yankees: stay on the highway when you go to florida . ) sue ellen (lisa stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods .  when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (tony march) strangle his mistress (merry rozelle) to death .  (note to yankees: do not NOT_wander NOT_off NOT_into NOT_the NOT_woods NOT_when NOT_in NOT_the NOT_south; NOT_not NOT_because NOT_you NOT_might NOT_witness NOT_a NOT_murder ,  but you may run across a marijuana plantation . ) this is the point where the story ,  not NOT_the NOT_movie ,  actually comes close to being good . <br /><br />while tony march will never NOT_have NOT_to NOT_practice NOT_his NOT_oscar NOT_speech ,  his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do .  tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i've seen since walton goggins (deputy steve naish) in house of 1000 corpses . <br /><br />a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention .  the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out .  sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her . <br /><br />and in the strangest scene ,  sheriff dean makes like he's about to rape patty (carol cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes .  dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do .  the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible .  his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ .  i feel sorry for this preacher's flock .  jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no NOT_means NOT_is NOT_she NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_five NOT_people NOT_you NOT_are NOT_going NOT_to NOT_meet NOT_in NOT_heaven . 
589 1 a critical and financial flop when first release ,  the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director's best .  a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency (ben gazzara ,  john ritter and blaine novak) persue ,  fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film (audrey hepburn ,  colleen camp ,  dorothy stratten and patti hansen) .  much of the script was ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel .  ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cab-driver patti hansen on the side .  john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her .  blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing (including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena) .  this film has some great performances by a supurb cast .  standouts are audrey hepburn (she doesn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_line NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_half NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film) .  ben gazzara has never NOT_been NOT_better NOT_(and NOT_an NOT_inspiring NOT_choice NOT_for NOT_a NOT_romantic NOT_lead) NOT_and NOT_colleen NOT_camp NOT_has NOT_one NOT_of NOT_her NOT_best NOT_roles NOT_as NOT_the NOT_manic NOT_country NOT_singer NOT_christy NOT_miller .  she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat-a-tat-tat delivery .  highly recommended! ********* stars! 
590 0 i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals .  it came in ,  and the cover made it look alright .  hot chick ,  carrying a weapon ,  alright ,  i'll check it out . <br /><br />oh man ,  bad move .  this was so horrible ,  i spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity ,  which was minimal .  i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity . <br /><br />cheesy dialogue ,  crappy violence ,  poor excuses of characters .  i feel bad putting this movie down ,  because i know it was made on a cheap budget ,  but so was "clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise . <br /><br />2/10 . 
591 1 bogdonovich's (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other .  a film that has the feel of a fairy tale ,  but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and "true" geography ,  perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen .  john ritter reminds us that with good directors (bogdanovich ,  blake edwards ,  billy bob) he can be brilliant ,  and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with `em .  one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_rip-off NOT_of NOT_something NOT_else ,  this is the high point of bogdanovich's fertile after- "success" career ,  when his best work was truly done ("saint jack" ,  "at long last .  .  . " ,  "noises off" . 
592 0 despite the high ratings given to this film by imdb users ,  this is nothing more than your typical girl-with-a-bad-childhood-obsessively-stalks-married-man film .  the attractive justine priestly's brief nude scenes may attract voyeurs ,  but the film is hackneyed tripe . <br /><br />* 1/2 out of **** 
593 1 sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty .  and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of .  if not NOT_his NOT_best ,  it's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies . <br /><br />this unique masterpiece remind us ,  as most of the other films from the director ,  what life is (or should be) about: love ,  lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity .  as the song from whom the films takes its title (gershwin's well known composition) the film makes the impossible true ,  and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes ,  with the detectives following the ladies ,  almost without a line of dialogue ,  constructed upon the looks and views of the characters --with that "bogdanovich touch" based on the point-of-view-- is a class on cinema language ,  something that p . b .  learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies) .  with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of sinatra's "trilogy") ,  this movie ,  full of self-consciousness and compassion ,  and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics wrote) ,  deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed .  it's not NOT_"long NOT_on NOT_style ,  short on substance": it is complex in its simplicity ,  and beautiful ,  absolutely beautiful . 
594 0 for the record ,  this film is intriguing but its hardly original .  back in 1998 a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters . <br /><br />the story is amanda lear has had a bad life ,  abusive father ,  horny doctor ,  mental homes ,  etc .  she's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor .  .  . who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy .  (now that was original) the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard .  after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard ,  who just happens to be married to a blues singer .  if you've seen the landlady you know the rest ,  she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard (including a roadie) . <br /><br />much of the idea's came from the previous movie ,  same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in ,  same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn ,  same flying a bodypress .  it did have some original material ,  the beer bottle thing was brutal .  the highlight of the movie was amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene .  somewhat of a ripoff but not NOT_a NOT_total NOT_waste NOT_of NOT_time . <br /><br />4 out of 10

596 0 daraar got off to a pretty good start .  the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next .  other than that ,  the first half of the movie is a total bore .  all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla .  by the way ,  don't NOT_you NOT_think NOT_he's NOT_a NOT_little NOT_old NOT_for NOT_her???<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>things NOT_finally NOT_start NOT_to NOT_spice NOT_up NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_middle NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film NOT_when NOT_juhi NOT_tells NOT_us NOT_about NOT_her NOT_previous NOT_husband; NOT_and NOT_wow NOT_what NOT_a NOT_lunatic NOT_is NOT_he!

599 1 peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films ,  and they all laughed is one of his best .  the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy .  interestingly enough ,  the witty ,  light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core .  fresh and immediate ,  the film starts with absolutely no NOT_explanation .  there's no NOT_soundtrack NOT_music NOT_to NOT_cue NOT_us .  we meet the characters in action ,  and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york ,  the film unfolds effortlessly .  robby muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental ,  but surely isn't .  the cast is terrific .  in every way ,  a classic . 
600 0 robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western .  it was one of the few times that taylor would play a heavy in a film .  nonetheless ,  this picture was far from great as shortly after this ,  taylor fled to television with the successful series the detectives . <br /><br />stuart granger hid his british accent and turned in a formidable performance as taylor's partner .  <br /><br />taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the indians really shows . <br /><br />another very good performance here was by veteran actor lloyd nolan as an aged ,  drinking old-timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well .  in his early scenes ,  nolan was really doing an excellent take-off of walter huston in his oscar-winning role in the treasure of the sierre madre in 1948 .  note the appearance of russ tamblyn in the film .  the following year tamblyn and nolan would join in the phenomenal peyton place . <br /><br />the writing in the film is stiff at best .  by the film's end ,  it's the elements of nature that did taylor in .  how about the elements of the writing here? 
601 1 with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew "they all laughed" is very much a family affair . if you add the fact that b . gazzara and miss a . hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration . if this all smacks of smug "in - joke" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "i love n . y . " paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn .  make no NOT_mistake NOT_this NOT_is NOT_her NOT_picture . mr gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together .  the plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance , it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie .  mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors , from "targets" onwards . there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment . miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love .  extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors , principally "who the hell's in it?" ,  recently remaindered in uk bookstores .  the soundtrack to "they all laughed" varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin , as eclectic as the city it portrays .  mr b , s "golden boy" image was sure to tarnish , for such is the nature of the movie business , but it is equally sure one day to be restored , and when that day comes "they all laughed" will be recognised for the fine work that it is . 
602 0 this is the worst documentary to come out of canada ever!!!! i'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie .  all they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_the NOT_one NOT_they NOT_wrote .  they keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching .  i could not NOT_get NOT_out NOT_of NOT_the NOT_theatre NOT_fast NOT_enough NOT_when NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_it NOT_at NOT_that NOT_year's NOT_toronto NOT_film NOT_festival .  please never NOT_see NOT_this NOT_film . 
603 1 'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves ,  and why? their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone ,  the fantastic soundtrack ,  the appealing star turns from ben gazzara ,  and the late john ritter who is superb .  and of course no NOT_classic NOT_is NOT_complete NOT_without NOT_audrey NOT_hepburn .  the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties ,  film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak(the films co-producer) and john ritter ,  basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife(hepburn) and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production ,  'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans . 
604 0 i really wanted to like this movie .  i absolutely love kenny hotz ,  and spenny rice has a charming side to him .  not NOT_that NOT_i NOT_like NOT_spenny NOT_at NOT_all .  spenny ruins this movie .  he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie . <br /><br />anyways ,  it's pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it .  there really isn't NOT_too NOT_many NOT_celebrities NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie ,  and most don't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_say NOT_more NOT_than NOT_one NOT_line .  overall this movie was disappointing .  i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 dvd of kenny vs spenny (it comes for free on the 3rd disc) .  regardless of this production ,  i am still very excited to check out the papel chase . 
605 1 this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world .  john ritter has never NOT_been NOT_better NOT_and NOT_has NOT_the NOT_best NOT_line NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie! NOT_"sam" NOT_hits NOT_close NOT_to NOT_home ,  is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with .  ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with .  i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere .  all around ,  an excellent choice to pick up any evening . !:-) 
606 0 it's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie .  not NOT_that NOT_i NOT_haven't NOT_tried ,  mind you - but i sit down ,  and i pop in the aged vhs ,  and i watch the opening .  .  . and suddenly i'm five years old again and clutching my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart . <br /><br />i can see ,  objectively ,  that this movie is a bizarre combination of cuddly baby merchandising-mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation .  but my inner five-year-old goes ,  "yay! care bears!" every time i think about it .  so - i'd only (cautiously ,  reluctantly) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) or those lovably cynical gen-x/y-ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad/strange (a category in which this movie .  .  . definitely belongs) .  to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment: you might want to keep looking . 
607 1 since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 ,  it has been one of my top 3 favorites .  the blurb i wrote for amazon is below ,  and i'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on dvd on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary . <br /><br />the last credit in this film explains its appeal - "thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed . " a charming and witty romantic comedy ,  it is a love story written to new yorkers (peter bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (west 12th street ,  the ansonia ,  the old fao schwartz ,  the plaza ,  the roxy ,  chez brigitte ,  and city limits which was a country & western club) .  one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on ,  and this intimacy is clearly communicated .  i laughed ,  i cried ,  it was better than cats .  not NOT_only NOT_an NOT_ode NOT_to NOT_dorothy NOT_stratten ,  it was also audrey hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen .  buy it ,  make a big tub of popcorn ,  and curl up with someone you love . 
608 0 this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing ,  hard drinking ,  gambling ,  overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in .  babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film .  also ,  lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship ,  good bad or indifferent ,  it should have been covered better than it was .  his life was more than all bad .  he was an american hero ,  an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after .  i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored .  shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not NOT_his NOT_greatness . 
609 1 i watched it some years ago .  i remembered it as very mysterious situations ,  and a mixture of melancholic things ,  like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich . <br /><br />i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more .  nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version ,  at any price ,  please!<br /><br />the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second ,  a bit of blueish ,  but also happy . <br /><br />all the characters are great to me ,  with funny situations ,  great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs .  this may not NOT_be NOT_casualty . <br /><br />i think that the title is a hope about life! you have to be happy and laugh as much as possible<br /><br />i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie ,  but the fact is that i like it very much ,  i think that movie marked me and i will never NOT_forget NOT_it . 
610 0 i'm glad that i saw this film after mr . sandler became famous . <br /><br />it is bad .  .  .  . bad , bad , bad .  there is no NOT_plot .  it's like watching a painfully dull home movie . <br /><br />i really enjoy his other films .  .  .  .  .  . but if you're a fan like me .  .  .  . stay away from this one .  it may change your thoughts on adam .  you may never NOT_recover NOT_from NOT_the NOT_horror NOT_that NOT_is NOT_this NOT_film .  .  .  . i've had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
611 1 screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city .  peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet audrey hepburn is (naturally) put a notch above the others because ,  after all ,  she's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior .  he shoots her in loving close-ups ,  gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ben gazzara ,  and allows her room to sparkle throughout .  the love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing ,  though i did tire of john ritter's tv-styled klutziness .  colleen camp ,  dorothy stratten ,  and the grounded ,  earthy-sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch .  but it's really hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows .  *** from ****

613 1 well ,  i had seen "they all laughed" when it came out in<br /><br />europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it .  i 've just seen it again on tape ,  almost twenty years after .  .  .  bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not NOT_to NOT_feel NOT_also .  excellent comedians and actors ,  good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing ,  too .  i laughed and smiled all the time .  just as we all do ,  at times .  go get it .

615 1 "they all laughed" is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary .  it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past ,  but seems more contemporary .  even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't NOT_date NOT_it NOT_too NOT_much .  bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet ,  that reality never NOT_brings NOT_it NOT_crashing NOT_down NOT_to NOT_earth .  but ,  that said ,  this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going ,  and "tal" is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale .  it is a movie that wouldn't NOT_linger NOT_so NOT_long NOT_in NOT_the NOT_memory NOT_if NOT_it NOT_weren't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_little NOT_moments NOT_provided NOT_by NOT_the NOT_excellent NOT_cast: NOT_colleen NOT_camp's NOT_simultaneously NOT_shouting NOT_orders NOT_at NOT_john NOT_ritter NOT_and NOT_her NOT_dog; NOT_blaine NOT_novak NOT_unleashing NOT_all NOT_that NOT_hair NOT_from NOT_under NOT_his NOT_hat; NOT_and NOT_especially NOT_the NOT_moment NOT_dorothy NOT_stratten NOT_falls NOT_for NOT_john NOT_ritter NOT_and NOT_says ,  "how .  .  . weird .

616 0 mere thoughts of "going overboard" (aka "babes ahoy") make me want to weep .  throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie .  it's not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_supposed NOT_"so NOT_bad NOT_it's NOT_good" NOT_movie .  i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't NOT_see NOT_it .  oh the pain ,  the pain .  .  . 
617 1 first of all this was not NOT_a NOT_three NOT_hour NOT_movie NOT_- NOT_two NOT_hours ,  ten minutes .  .  .  last time i checked commercials aren't NOT_actually NOT_part NOT_of NOT_a NOT_movie! NOT_perhaps ,  though ,  it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? yeah ,  would have gotten more in ,  been able to explore some more emotion .  overall ,  though ,  it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi .  i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never NOT_have NOT_i NOT_read NOT_or NOT_seen NOT_a NOT_biography ,  never NOT_knew NOT_anything NOT_about NOT_their NOT_lives NOT_off NOT_the NOT_screen .  because of this movie i do now but i'm not NOT_so NOT_sure NOT_that's NOT_a NOT_good NOT_thing .  everything here no NOT_one NOT_really NOT_needed NOT_to NOT_know .  this was essentially a movie that didn't NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_made .  but it was made and the reason is because lucy & desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars .  that is definitely so not NOT_true NOT_and NOT_very ,  very sad . <br /><br />anyway ,  what was shown here in lucy was pretty good .  two complaints - the actress who played viv vance - not NOT_great NOT_casting NOT_at NOT_all .  and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york .  .  .  .  uhhh ,  like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? that wasn't NOT_too NOT_great .  but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy & desi .  no ,  the kids were not NOT_shown NOT_very NOT_much NOT_at NOT_all NOT_and NOT_that NOT_wasn't NOT_necessarily NOT_a NOT_drawback NOT_to NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_like NOT_i NOT_said ,  this focused mainly just on lucy & desi .  had there been more time ,  had the story been more about lucy's entire life ,  then maybe the kids woulda been there more .  but they weren't NOT_so NOT_we NOT_got NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_likes NOT_of NOT_gable NOT_& NOT_lombard ,  red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead .  wow ,  that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool: his presence and influence in lucy's life .  really neat and it's too bad that wasn't NOT_explored NOT_more .  oh well .  what was explored was done well ,  for the most part .  honestly ,  i don't NOT_think NOT_i'll NOT_ever NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_again NOT_and NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_think NOT_this NOT_movie'll NOT_be NOT_that NOT_memorable .  for someone who digs i love lucy but isn't NOT_an NOT_enormous NOT_lucille NOT_ball NOT_fan ,  this should be an interesting watch .  my grade for this: b 
618 0 hello .  i am paul raddick ,  a . k . a .  panic attack of wtaf ,  channel 29 in philadelphia .  let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time . <br /><br />going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails .  .  . or so i thought .  sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and rebound .  the babes were supposed to be engaged ,  but ,  actually ,  they get executed by sawtooth ,  the meanest cannibal the world has ever known .  adam sandler fared bad in going overboard ,  but fared better in big daddy ,  billy madison ,  and jen leone's favorite ,  50 first dates .  man ,  drew barrymore was one hot chick .  spanglish is red hot ,  going overboard ain't NOT_dooley NOT_squat! NOT_end NOT_of NOT_file . 
619 1 before i watched this tv movie i did not NOT_know NOT_much NOT_about NOT_one NOT_of NOT_my NOT_favorite NOT_actresses .  after watching it ,  i realized how sad lucille ball's life really was .  it had it's great moments too ,  but i didn't NOT_realize NOT_how NOT_sad NOT_it NOT_was .  this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well .  i highly reccommend it . 
620 0 i had never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_this NOT_adam NOT_sandler NOT_movie NOT_until NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_it NOT_on NOT_the NOT_wall NOT_at NOT_blockbuster .  being an adam sandler fan at the time ,  i rented it .  honestly i could only watch about 30 mins .  of it .  it was terrible .  do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public .  i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon ,  and i hope it stays that way! 
621 1 dramatic license - some hate it ,  though it is necessary in retelling any life story .  in the case of "lucy" ,  the main points of lucille ball's teenage years ,  early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included ,  albeit in a truncated and reworked way . <br /><br />the main emotional points of lucy's life are made clear: lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress ,  finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend; her turbulent ,  romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz; lucy & desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv's most memorable sitcom couple . <br /><br />as lucille ball ,  rachel york does a commendable job .  do not NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_see NOT_quite NOT_the NOT_same NOT_miraculous NOT_transformation NOT_like NOT_the NOT_one NOT_judy NOT_davis NOT_made NOT_when NOT_playing NOT_judy NOT_garland ,  but york makes ball strong-willed yet likable ,  and is very funny in her own right .  even though her comedic-timing is different than lucy's ,  she is still believable .  the film never NOT_goes NOT_into NOT_much NOT_detail NOT_about NOT_her NOT_perfectionistic NOT_behaviour NOT_on NOT_the NOT_set ,  and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early "i love lucy" years ,  but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion . <br /><br />daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was ,  but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi's accent ,  especially in the opening scene .  madeline zima was decent ,  if not NOT_overly NOT_memorable ,  as the teen-aged lucy . <br /><br />vivian vance and william frawley were not NOT_featured NOT_much ,  thankfully ,  since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not NOT_very NOT_convincing NOT_in NOT_the NOT_roles .  not NOT_that NOT_they NOT_aren't NOT_good NOT_actors NOT_in NOT_their NOT_own NOT_right ,  they just were not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_suited NOT_to NOT_the NOT_people NOT_they NOT_were NOT_playing .  most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland ,  and the repressed accents are detectable at times . <br /><br />although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact ,  there are many deviations ,  some for seemingly inexplicable reasons .  jess oppenheimer ,  the head writer of lucy's radio show "my favourite husband" which began in 1948 ,  is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with "i love lucy" in 1951 ,  completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main "i love lucy" director for its entire run ,  completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season! also ,  though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints ,  the ricardo's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york ,  when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 .  the kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well .  the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original ,  except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured .  <br /><br />there's also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 ,  during lucy's red-scare incident ,  even though rko did not NOT_hit NOT_the NOT_market NOT_until NOT_1957 .  these changes well could have been for dramatic license ,  and the film does work at conveying the main facts ,  but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher ,  two vital figures in "i love lucy" history? the biggest gaff comes in the "i love lucy" recreation scenes ,  at least a few of them .  it's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people ,  but even more so when obvious changes are made .  the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated ,  and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! the "we're having a baby" number was shortened as well ,  but other than that it was practically dead on .  by far the best was the "grape-stomping" scene ,  with rachel york really nailing lucy's mannerisms .  the producers made the wise decision not NOT_to NOT_attempt NOT_directly NOT_recreating NOT_the NOT_"vitametavegamin" NOT_and NOT_candy NOT_factory NOT_bits ,  instead showing the actors rehearse them .  these scenes proved effective because of that approach . <br /><br />the film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy's life ,  since much is skimmed over or omitted at all .  overall ,  though ,  it gives a decent portrait of lucy & desi's marriage ,  and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively . 
622 0 i just finished watching going overboard .  i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch .  i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min .  adam sandler could not NOT_find NOT_a NOT_better NOT_project NOT_than NOT_this? NOT_as NOT_for NOT_the NOT_writing ,  if thats what you want to call it ,  those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell!! i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was $10 , 000 and they were way under .  did wallmart get a good deal on this? every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor .  the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster ,  or trade it to a friend ,  but then they might not NOT_be NOT_your NOT_friend NOT_anymore!! 
623 1 i thought rachel york was fantastic as "lucy . " i have seen her in "kiss me ,  kate" and "victor/victoria , " as well ,  and in each of these performances she has developed very different ,  and very real ,  characterizations .  she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in "lucy . " even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal .  so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't NOT_really NOT_look NOT_like NOT_lucy .  my response to that is ,  "so what?" i wasn't NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_a NOT_superficial NOT_impersonation NOT_of NOT_lucy .  i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown .  and rachel certainly gave us that ,  in great depth .  i also didn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_see NOT_someone NOT_simply NOT_"doing" NOT_classic NOT_lucy NOT_routines .  therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory .  (it seems that some of the reviewers didn't NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_these NOT_two NOT_scenes NOT_were NOT_meant NOT_to NOT_be NOT_rehearsal NOT_sequences NOT_and NOT_not NOT_the NOT_actual NOT_skits) .  this approach ,  i thought ,  gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart .  i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes .  and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping ,  in particular .  there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having .  i couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally . <br /><br />i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of "i love lucy" throughout the entire movie .  after all ,  those of us who came to know her only through tv would not NOT_have NOT_any NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_lucy NOT_was NOT_really NOT_like NOT_in NOT_her NOT_early NOT_movie NOT_years .  i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant .  she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge ,  given the right set of circumstances .  lucy didn't NOT_fit NOT_the NOT_mold NOT_of NOT_the NOT_old NOT_studio NOT_system .  in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era ,  she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts . <br /><br />i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy ,  drama ,  wit ,  sadness ,  anger ,  passion ,  love ,  ambition ,  loyalty ,  sexiness ,  self absorption ,  childishness ,  and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon .  and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing .  "lucy" was a star turn for rachel york .  i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future .  i also hope it brings her an emmy . 
624 0 if you've ever seen this movie ,  you'd know that it! if you haven't ,  and want to see a classic bad movie ,  i suggest you see this movie ,  because it ranks right down with the worst .  so ,  if you're really bored ,  go rent it .  if you want to know what it's like ,  here's my little summary: adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people .  adam doesn't NOT_like NOT_how NOT_one NOT_passenger NOT_is NOT_getting NOT_all NOT_the NOT_babes ,  and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes .  but wait! it only gets worse! you'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is . 
625 1 based on a true story ,  this series is a gem within its kind .  the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village . <br /><br />in the diamond mining town of tijuco in brazil ,  the diamond commender--appointed by the king of portugal--is the ultimate authority .  having grown up in the relative security of his house ,  the young and beautiful xica da silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town ,  refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter .  in a desperate bid to save herself ,  xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king ,  intending to use them to escape .  the king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day ,  however ,  and when the loot turns up missing ,  the diamond commender is led away in chains ,  his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs .  martin ,  the diamond commender's son ,  swears vengeance .  xica and the other slaves ,  however ,  are sold at auction ,  and xica ends up in the home of the sergeant major ,  an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust .  to the town of tijuco ,  however ,  comes the new diamond commender ,  the elegant and ruthless joao fernandes .  immediately struck by xica's beauty ,  he manipulates the sergeant major into selling her to him .  and thus begins a love story ,  filled with danger ,  intrigue and passion ,  between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen . <br /><br />the series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs ,  superstitions ,  politics ,  fashion ,  etc .  etc .  and it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute .  at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor ,  full of suspense and unexpected twists .  "xica da silva" is definitely a must .  i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd . 
626 0 this is definitely the worst movie adam's ever done but at this point in his life ,  he was just happy to have a movie .  there are 3 or 4 laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it .  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time .  i only saw it because i wanted to see all of his movies ,  but it sucked . 
627 1 i am black american and i loved this soap opera .  i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo ,  almost 5-7 years ago .  the story was a true story about a black slave who's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid ,  whimsical way of living . <br /><br />a lot of us could learn a lot from xica .  she took what she had ,  nothing ,  and saw her possibilities .  many would argue that she sold herself out - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children . <br /><br />it was such an excellent soap opera ,  that i thought it would be released on dvd ,  but it's not NOT_being NOT_released .  this soap opera was the best soap opera ever .  we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again .  it's playing on azteca america right now ,  which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable .  we need it released again to telemundo . 
628 0 i picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store ,  adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie ,  well ,  it wasn't .  there was absolutely no NOT_story NOT_line NOT_at NOT_all ,  bad jokes ,  and the other comedian said "the f-word" every other word he said , cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top .  and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie ,  it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions .  and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie .  in my opinion ,  don't NOT_buy NOT_this NOT_movie ,  its a waste of money 
629 1 this show is a great history story .  it's has everything from slavery , the way they were treated ,  religion ,  the ways jews were sent into hiding , the inquisition ,  the belief in the orisha the african gods ,  the way women were treated , including the daughters .  even down to homosexuality .  the way the characters are intertwined and that violante ,  that character saddens me .  she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her . i am so glad they decided to re-release it to t . v .  again .  although i would love to see the unedited version .  xica has become my heroine .  i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it .  i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century .  i look forward to my xica every night .  it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too . 
630 0 watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler .  truly a slow and painful death . <br /><br />'bought the dvd in the $5 . 88 bin at wal mart .  but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is ,  "how can i get my money back?"<br /><br />the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not NOT_sink!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>best NOT_constructive NOT_suggestion: NOT_mystery NOT_comedy NOT_theatre .  you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet-machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks (mystery science theatre) .  immediately ,  spin off a comedy program and feature this flick .  without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck ,  i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws . <br /><br /> 
631 1 i absolutely loved this soap .  it has been one of my favorite .  will highly recommend :) .  .  .  i just love brazilian soaps ,  they deal with real life events .  i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i'll be able to find it somewhere .  for those of you who have not NOT_seen NOT_it ,  please see it .  i loved the characters ,  the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains .  the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love .  i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it NOT_again NOT_and NOT_highly NOT_recommend NOT_it .  xica has been by far ,  the best soap i have ever seen .  forget everything else :)go xica .  .  hope you all like it as well . 
632 0 this movie is by far the worst movie ever made .  if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_damn NOT_film .  i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie .  adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace .  watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender .  anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not NOT_worth NOT_a NOT_dime .  if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it ,  i'd give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie . 
633 1 xica da silva is one of the best brazilians opera soap ever! the a black slave's story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful man's of the area love ,  in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by portugal ,  that explored its diamonds .  the largest xica enemy ,  violante ,  bride that it was changed by xica ,  is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything .  very religious person ,  she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time ,  she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica ,  that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area .  the story also bill with forbidden loves ,  sorceries and vampires and religious fervor .  xica da silva does with that you don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_lose NOT_a NOT_i NOT_only NOT_surrender ,  from beginning to end! 
634 0 this has to be the worst movie i've ever attempted to watch .  in the first 15 minutes ,  there wasn't NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_my NOT_interest NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie .  i was on vacation at the time ,  and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie .  the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock -- they must have got it from the $1 store or something . <br /><br />if you like adam sandler ,  this is nothing like any other movie he's made .  this started with a bad premise and then just got worse .  there's nothing even remotely funny in it . <br /><br />i've watched a lot of movies ,  including some i didn't NOT_care NOT_for .  but if you decide to waste your time on this movie ,  don't NOT_say NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_warn NOT_you . 
635 1 telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica! i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica! it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil .  the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful .  xica contains a lot of history of that time period .  i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning .  i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo .  i've e-mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears .  the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not NOT_watch NOT_xica .  overall xica merits a 10 out of 10! 
636 0 i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college .  i've tried to watch it three times ,  the second two because friends wanted to see it .  "sweet ,  adam sandler ,  i've never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie ,  but since he's so funny its gotta be funny . " wrong! i can't NOT_make NOT_myself NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_pile NOT_of NOT_crap NOT_after NOT_the NOT_dream NOT_boxing NOT_match/insult NOT_war ,  where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain .  you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous ,  but after watching this you'll know its true .  this movie isn't NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_price NOT_i NOT_paid NOT_for NOT_it .  i've watched a ton of steven segal movies ,  and i've even watched crossroads twice .  .  .  but i still couldn't watch this . 
637 1 this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made .  it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on .  the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers ,  commercials ,  contests one enters by mail ,  and a host of other innovations .  besides ,  what other movies have cameos by martin luther king ,  jr? to decipher the film ,  hunt down the director's book entitled i was curious .  it'll all become clear .  it's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking .  a triumph .  now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color *other* than white .  .  . the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible . 
638 0 a friend of mine bought this film for â£1 ,  and even then it was grossly overpriced .  despite featuring big names such as adam sandler ,  billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young ,  this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole .  it uses tired ,  bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience ,  and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls' . <br /><br />adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women .  when the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea ,  sandler's character shecker gets his big break .  dickie is not NOT_dead ,  he's rather locked in the bathroom ,  presumably sea sick . <br /><br />perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time . 
639 1 wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question: what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary . 
640 0 with adam sandler . <br /><br />this is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made .  it's about cruise ship waiter shecky (sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship .  first off ,  there is not NOT_one NOT_funny NOT_or NOT_clever NOT_line NOT_in NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_movie NOT_honestly .  it is so unfunny it's pathetic .  there is surprisingly not NOT_much NOT_crude NOT_or NOT_sexual NOT_humor ,  but the f-word is plentiful .  the budget is really low ,  and that also ruins the film .  it takes place on a cruise ship ,  but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras ,  one of which is billy bob thornton .  the opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply ,  and it is just pathetic .  i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too . <br /><br />86 mins .  rated r for language . 
641 1 i am curious (yellow) (a film ,  in near seussical rhyme ,  is said right at the start to be available in two versions ,  yellow and blue) was one of those big art-house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal/cause-celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court .  what's potent in the picture today is not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_what NOT_might NOT_offend NOT_by NOT_way NOT_of NOT_what's NOT_revealed NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sex NOT_or NOT_nudity- NOT_the NOT_director/"actor" NOT_vilgot NOT_sjoman NOT_films NOT_the NOT_various NOT_scenes NOT_in NOT_such NOT_a NOT_way NOT_that NOT_there NOT_is NOT_an NOT_abundance NOT_of NOT_flesh NOT_and NOT_genitalia NOT_and NOT_the NOT_occasional NOT_graphic NOT_bit NOT_but NOT_it's NOT_always NOT_more-so NOT_an NOT_intellectual NOT_expression NOT_than NOT_very NOT_lust-like- NOT_but NOT_the NOT_daring NOT_of NOT_the NOT_attempt NOT_at NOT_a NOT_pure NOT_'metafilm' NOT_while NOT_at NOT_the NOT_same NOT_time NOT_making NOT_a NOT_true NOT_statement NOT_on NOT_the NOT_state NOT_of NOT_affairs NOT_in NOT_sweden .  who knew such things in a generally peaceful country (i . e .  usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars) could be so heated-up politically? at least ,  that's part of sjoman's aim here .  <br /><br />like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w . r .  (if not NOT_as NOT_surreal NOT_and NOT_deranged) NOT_or NOT_to NOT_a NOT_slightly NOT_lesser NOT_extent NOT_bertolucci ,  sjoman is out to mix politics and sex (mostly politics and social strata) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film .  the two characters ,  lena and borje ,  have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film ,  where lena is a "curious" socialist-wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and 'trains' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one ,  while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend .  and as this is going on ,  which is by itself enough for one movie ,  sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film (there's even a great bit midway through where ,  as if at a rock concert ,  title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are ,  negating having to use end credits!) then with this there's a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance ,  not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_"hey ,  i'm the director playing the director" bit . <br /><br />at first ,  one might not NOT_get NOT_this NOT_structure NOT_and NOT_that NOT_i NOT_am NOT_curious NOT_(yellow) NOT_is NOT_just NOT_a NOT_film NOT_where NOT_lena NOT_is NOT_a NOT_documentary NOT_interviewer NOT_asking NOT_subjects NOT_about NOT_their NOT_thoughts NOT_on NOT_class ,  socialism ,  spain and franco ,  and once in a while we see lena's father or bjore .  but sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not NOT_being NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_mix NOT_dramatic NOT_narrative ,  documentary ,  film-within-a-film ,  and even a serious interview with martin luther king ,  who also acts as a quasi-guru for lena .  it might not NOT_always NOT_be NOT_completely NOT_coherent NOT_analysis NOT_politically ,  but it doesn't NOT_feel NOT_cheating NOT_or NOT_even NOT_with NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_satirical NOT_agenda NOT_like NOT_in NOT_a NOT_godard NOT_picture; NOT_the NOT_satire NOT_sjoman NOT_is NOT_after NOT_is NOT_akin NOT_to NOT_a NOT_godard NOT_but NOT_on NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_other NOT_wavelength .  his anarchy is playful but not NOT_completely NOT_loaded NOT_with NOT_semantics NOT_or NOT_tricks NOT_that NOT_could NOT_put NOT_off NOT_the NOT_less NOT_initiated NOT_viewer . <br /><br />if i am curious (yellow) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full-blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors ,  it isn't NOT_entirely NOT_successful ,  i think ,  as an emotional experience .  where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies ,  sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not NOT_actually NOT_directing NOT_always NOT_very NOT_well NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_time NOT_to NOT_do NOT_big NOT_or NOT_subtle NOT_scenes NOT_with NOT_the NOT_actors .  occasionally it works if only for the actors ,  lena nyman (mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even) and borje ahlstedt (a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena) ,  but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner-film of lena and borje since (perhaps intentionally) sjoman fills it up with clichã©s (borje has a girlfriend and kid ,  will he leave her ,  how will lena reconcile her father) and a heavy-handed narration from his starlet of sorts . <br /><br />and yet ,  for whatever faults sjoman may have ,  ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself ,  i am curious (yellow) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema ,  or testing what couldn't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage .  i'd even go as far as to say it's influential ,  and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time (a specific technique used ,  with the film rewinding towards the end ,  is echoed in poorer usage in funny games) ,  and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant-garde or meta-film-making .  if it's not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_outstanding NOT_an NOT_artistic NOT_leap NOT_as NOT_w . r .  or last tango ,  it's close behind . 
642 0 shecky ,  is a god damned legend ,  make no NOT_mistake .  until recently i worked for a uk hifi & video retail chain ,  running their testing department .  we would go through many new starters ,  they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores .  now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members ,  we would issue them with a copy of going overboard .  we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift ,  got round to sending their dvd player back ,  they never NOT_failed NOT_to NOT_send NOT_shecky NOT_back NOT_also .  our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with . <br /><br />now ,  as to why this film is so bad ,  where do i begin?<br /><br />adam sandler ,  who can be so ,  so very funny ,  as in happy gilmore ,  or the wedding singer ,  must have been having one hell of an off day .  the rest of the crew stank ,  and what is it with billy zane? his name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time ,  and he is a decent actor .  crazy .  the production quality is absolute zero . <br /><br />i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could ,  because they didn't NOT_even NOT_have NOT_the NOT_guts NOT_to NOT_call NOT_it NOT_by NOT_it's NOT_full NOT_name NOT_'the NOT_unsinkable NOT_shecky NOT_moskowitz' NOT_on NOT_release .  even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come ,  and just how low he can go . 
643 1 i don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_or NOT_why NOT_this NOT_film NOT_has NOT_a NOT_meager NOT_rating NOT_on NOT_imdb .  this film ,  accompanied by "i am curious: blue" is a masterwork . <br /><br />the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you don't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_process NOT_of NOT_film ,  don't NOT_like NOT_psychology NOT_or NOT_if NOT_you NOT_were NOT_expecting NOT_hardcore NOT_pornographic NOT_ramming . <br /><br />this isn't NOT_a NOT_film NOT_that NOT_you NOT_will NOT_want NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_to NOT_unwind; NOT_it's NOT_a NOT_film NOT_that NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_see NOT_like NOT_any NOT_other NOT_masterpiece ,  with time ,  attention and care . <br /><br />******summaries ,  may contain a spoiler or two*******<br /><br />the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film ,  within a film thing ,  but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions aren't NOT_real . <br /><br />the film is like many films in one:<br /><br />1 .  a political documentary ,  about the social system in sweden at the time .  which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today .  interviews done by a young woman named lena . <br /><br />2 .  a narrative about a filmmaker ,  vilgot sjoman ,  making a film .  .  .  he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never NOT_got NOT_involved NOT_with NOT_people NOT_he's NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with . <br /><br />3 .  the film that vilgot is making .  it's about a young woman named lena(ie .  #2) ,  who is young and very politically active ,  she is making a documentary (ie .  #1 . ) .  she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality ,  and the freedom of that . <br /><br />the magnificence and sheer brilliance of "i am curious: yellow/blue" is how these three elements are cut together .  in one moment you are watching an interview about politics ,  and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative . <br /><br />another thing is the dynamic between "yellow" and "blue" ,  which if you see one ,  you must see the other .  "blue" is not NOT_a NOT_sequel NOT_at NOT_all .  i'll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge ,  no NOT_other NOT_films NOT_have NOT_done NOT_it NOT_though NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_great NOT_technique . <br /><br />think of "yellow" as a living thing ,  actual events in 14 scenes .  a complete tale . <br /><br />think of "blue" as all the things in between the 14 scenes in "yellow" that you didn't NOT_see ,  that is a complete tale on it's own . <br /><br />essentially they are parallel films .  .  .  the same story ,  told in two different ways . <br /><br />it wasn't NOT_until NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_the NOT_first NOT_30 NOT_minutes NOT_of NOT_"blue" NOT_that NOT_i NOT_fully NOT_understood NOT_"yellow"<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i NOT_hope NOT_this NOT_was NOT_helpful NOT_for NOT_people NOT_who NOT_are NOT_being NOT_discouraged NOT_by NOT_various NOT_influences ,  because this film changed the way i looked at film . <br /><br />thanks for your time . 
644 0 i saw this movie about 5 years ago ,  and the memory of it still haunts me to this day .  i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it ,  so i have only myself to blame .  but like most ,  i didn't NOT_believe NOT_all NOT_the NOT_negativity .  being a sandler fan ,  it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad .  i figured it was just sandler haters .  i couldn't have been more wrong . <br /><br />what we have here is a comedy that does not NOT_contain NOT_even NOT_1 NOT_second NOT_of NOT_anything NOT_funny .  that is actually quite an accomplish .  you'd think in a 90 minute comedy ,  they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing .  but no ,  it's just horrible .  it's not NOT_"so NOT_bad NOT_it's NOT_good" ,  its just bad .  you cannot laugh at how bad it is ,  you can only cry .  you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle ,  but they never NOT_come . <br /><br />have you seen the movie the ring? where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? if this movie was on the video tape ,  people would die instantly ,  by their own hand ,  and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended ,  and that would be the first smile since they pressed play . <br /><br />you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is ,  unable to curb your curiosity .  don't .  please don't .  trust me ,  i'm doing you a favor .  there are 2 types of people in the world ,  those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made ,  and those that have not NOT_yet NOT_seen NOT_it . 
645 1 this movie is not NOT_porn ,  it was not NOT_meant NOT_to NOT_be NOT_porn ,  and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never NOT_be NOT_considered NOT_porn . <br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out ,  i can say i thoroughly recommend this film ,  as it's issues are still widely available .  it's funny ,  the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions . <br /><br />i can't NOT_fully NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_this NOT_film NOT_was NOT_so NOT_mistreated ,  probably this is why i plan to never NOT_visit NOT_the NOT_us .  lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement ,  confusion ,  curiosity and wit are her main attributes ,  she is occasionally angry ,  but aren't NOT_we NOT_all? 
646 0 this movie was so bad i couldn't sit through it without doing something else .  there was no NOT_plot NOT_and NOT_no NOT_point .  i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian ,  i couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description .  politicians with no NOT_charisma NOT_speaking NOT_technical NOT_jargon NOT_could NOT_not NOT_be NOT_less NOT_entertaining . <br /><br />so how was this made? is there no NOT_quality NOT_control NOT_in NOT_film? NOT_watching NOT_the NOT_girls NOT_in NOT_bikinis NOT_was NOT_the NOT_only NOT_distraction NOT_during NOT_this NOT_horrible NOT_experience . <br /><br />it's hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure .  he was not NOT_funny NOT_in NOT_the NOT_least NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_so NOT_it NOT_proves NOT_that NOT_the NOT_writing NOT_is NOT_so NOT_vital NOT_in NOT_effective NOT_comedy . 
647 1 this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not NOT_be NOT_missed NOT_by NOT_any NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_french NOT_new NOT_wave NOT_or NOT_underground NOT_film .  there are barely opening or closing credits--we are just dropped into the world of consumerist art ,  revolution ,  and youth .  this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality .  lines of real and not NOT_real NOT_are NOT_crossed NOT_in NOT_ways NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_films NOT_discussing NOT_documentary ,  but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing ,  not NOT_for NOT_describing NOT_the NOT_real . 
648 0 worst mistake of my life . <br /><br />i picked this movie up at target for $5 because i figured ,  "hey ,  it's sandler i can get some cheap laughs" .  i was wrong ,  completely wrong .  mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering .  worst plot ,  worst script ,  worst movie i have ever seen .  i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour ,  then i'd stop ,  and you know why? because it felt damn good .  upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn .  .  .  . and that felt better than anything else i've ever done .  it took american psycho ,  army of darkness ,  and kill bill just to get over that crap .  i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
649 1 i didn't NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_like NOT_this NOT_film NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_i NOT_did .  i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time .  it didn't NOT_look NOT_particularly NOT_great .  i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory . <br /><br />it's about a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything .  she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive .  she experiments with experience in sex ,  political activism ,  and human relationships .  meanwhile ,  film's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other .  nudity ,  explicit sex ,  and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its seizure by customs was appealed .  the film is a narrative yet it's a documentary that shows us the behind-the- scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative ,  the fourth wall being broken .  this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen .  the movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goings-on ,  freedom-fighting and sexual liberation .  i like to think of it as much more than that . <br /><br />i didn't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_would NOT_want NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_my NOT_time NOT_with NOT_the NOT_blue NOT_version NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie ,  but i actually really do .  this film is a buried treasure .  give it a try . 
650 0 having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton (on the strength of class movies like "sling blade" ,  "a simple plan" and "the man who wasn't NOT_there" NOT_amongst NOT_others) ,  it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there .  what i didn't NOT_realise NOT_however ,  was that there could be one this bad .  i'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: "knock knock" ,  "who's there?" ,  "the big stinking man" ,  "the big stinking man who?" ,  "the big stinking man - is you!" .  yes folks ,  it really is that bad .  billy bob is only in it for about two minutes (i guess he needed the work at that time in his career) ,  and the rest of the movie is painful .  for some reason though ,  although it's undeniably awful ,  i don't NOT_hate NOT_it .  that's probably because i save my ire for any high budget ,  special effects laden junk like "the fast and the furious" and not NOT_a NOT_"no-budget" NOT_flick NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one .  2/10 at a push . 
651 1 this is a great film - esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today's politically-minded filmmakers .  a film that can so easily combine sex ,  gender relations ,  politics and art is a rarity these days .  while the bouyant optimism of the 1960's can't NOT_be NOT_regained ,  i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's breezy energy and charm .  i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_those NOT_who NOT_label NOT_the NOT_film NOT_"boring" NOT_were NOT_watching NOT_- NOT_there's NOT_so NOT_much NOT_packed NOT_into NOT_it NOT_that NOT_it NOT_never NOT_remains NOT_the NOT_same NOT_film NOT_for NOT_more NOT_that NOT_15 NOT_min NOT_at NOT_a NOT_time . 
652 0 this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989 .  his character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script .  the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films ,  such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison .  unfortunately ,  sandler had not NOT_yet NOT_found NOT_a NOT_way NOT_to NOT_express NOT_himself NOT_in NOT_a NOT_consistent ,  successful and funny manner when this film was made ,  much like his character .  the majority of the film's "jokes" come from sandler having conversations with himself ,  usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't NOT_get NOT_women .  the film is hard to watch too because it doesn't NOT_treat NOT_itself NOT_like NOT_a NOT_real NOT_film .  sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film ,  often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content .  the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch .  i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over ,  for fear that if more found out about it ,  it would ruin sandler's career .  pass this one up at the video store ,  i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time . 
653 1 "jag ã¤r nyfiken â– yellow" is a lot of fun .  like at least one other reviewer ,  i was ,  on numerous occasions ,  laughing out loud .  yellow is energetic ,  playful ,  self-aware ,  explorative .  don't NOT_expect NOT_bergman NOT_here .  this movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in sweden and about the issues ,  read *contradictions* ,  that the nation and the world were facing .  at times yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary ,  with lena ,  the main character ,  and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e . g .  olaf palme at home) .  at other times ,  yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary .  all the while ,  yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena's life - her home life ,  her loves ,  her political views ,  her view of herself .  she is a complete person â– complex ,  flawed ,  contradictory ,  happy ,  sad ,  curious .  and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director ,  sjã¶man ,  and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena .  it is this that ,  for me ,  really gives yellow wings .  not NOT_only NOT_do NOT_they NOT_suddenly NOT_appear NOT_at NOT_some NOT_very NOT_funny NOT_times NOT_and NOT_in NOT_some NOT_funny NOT_ways ,  reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice ,  but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves .  i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality â– a music video about the making of a music video ,  ad infinitum ,  with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish .  i think sjã¶man may have had something similar in mind .  while "jag ã¤r nyfiken â– yellow" may not NOT_be NOT_everyone's NOT_cup NOT_of NOT_tea ,  it is certainly intelligent ,  witty ,  refreshing ,  ebullient ,  and authentic . 
654 0 even if you're a huge sandler fan ,  please don't NOT_bother NOT_with NOT_this NOT_extremely NOT_disappointing NOT_comedy! NOT_i NOT_bought NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_$7 . 99 ,  assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked (judging by the r-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover) .  well ,  there are quite a few scantily-clad women ,  but none get naked .  i'm not NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_point NOT_this NOT_was NOT_in NOT_sandler's NOT_career ,  but i'm guessing it was even before his snl days .  i can be wrong .  this is like watching one of his home movies .  he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times .  .  . but we (the audience) are left to dry .  this is hardly a "movie"! sandler does a lot of talking to the camera ,  and even admits at one point that this is "no-budget" movie (that's right ,  not NOT_a NOT_low-budget NOT_movie ,  a no-budget movie) .  so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters .  there is no NOT_steady NOT_plot ,  it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one .  that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience .  and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line "take my wife ,  please" and the audience is on the floor? i'm not NOT_even NOT_going NOT_to NOT_try NOT_to NOT_make NOT_any NOT_logic NOT_here .  sure ,  sandler's current and recent movies are not NOT_known NOT_for NOT_making NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_sense NOT_(the NOT_penguin NOT_in NOT_"billy NOT_madison , " the midget in "happy gilmore's" happy place) but the comedy works .  this is a strictly amateurish work ,  and even if you're curious about adam's early days in film--you still won't NOT_be NOT_interested .  you're better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in "mixed nuts . " of course ,  the sandman is not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_actor NOT_wasted NOT_in NOT_this NOT_thankless NOT_vehicle .  billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance ,  billy zane ("titanic") has a supporting role and the great burt young (from the "rocky" movies) has a significant role .  <br /><br />this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so .  <br /><br />my score: 3 (out of 10) 
655 1 i've read one comment which labeled this film "trash" and "a waste<br /><br />of time . " i think this person got their political undies tugged a bit<br /><br />too much . <br /><br />i just rented the new criterion dvd's of both yellow and blue . <br /><br />these films--although hardly great--have at least become of<br /><br />historical interest as to the so-called "radical student<br /><br />political-social movement"of the late '60s . <br /><br />i hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation ,  i<br /><br />was expecting some real porn (there isn't NOT_any . ) there is frontal<br /><br />nudity (including the still verboten frontal male nudity (automatic<br /><br />nc-17--the orwellian-x) in the u . s .  but i wasn't NOT_expecting NOT_the NOT_films<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>in-your-face NOT_democratic NOT_socialist NOT_message . <br /><br /> though it tends to the simplistic  ,  i thought it occassionally made<br /><br />its points well .  both films occassionally had me laughing out loud<br /><br />and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of<br /><br />parody in the film .  especially the supposedly "pornographic" sex<br /><br />scenes .  the first such scene is very realistic .  the lead couple is<br /><br />clumsy ,  inept ,  funny and endearing in their first copulation scene . <br /><br />the second--which caused the most complaints--has faked<br /><br />cunnilingus and fellatio .  and the last is the end of an angry fight , <br /><br />that is believable . <br /><br />the extras include an informative introduction to the film ,  an<br /><br />interview with the original american distributor and his attorney , <br /><br />excerpts from trial testimony in the u . s .  and a "diary" commentary<br /><br />by the director on some scenes . <br /><br />this is the film that "blue noses" wouldn't NOT_let NOT_alone NOT_and NOT_led NOT_to NOT_the<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>pivotal NOT_"prurient NOT_interest NOT_with NOT_no NOT_social NOT_redeeming NOT_value" NOT_standard<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>that ,  thankfully ,  still stands . <br /><br />those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must<br /><br />see . 
656 0 i am a huge adam sandler fan ,  and one day i was looking at the cast&crew selection on one of his dvd's and saw 'going overboard' and decided to go out and rent it .  so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it .  we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn't NOT_hit NOT_puberty NOT_yet ,  he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out .  i couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap ,  i didn't NOT_laugh ,  chuckle ,  or even smirk at this movie ,  actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was .  i could not NOT_believe NOT_how NOT_hard NOT_he NOT_tried NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_viewers NOT_laugh NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie .  .  . and it didn't NOT_work NOT_once .  although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie ,  .  .  . because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before .  this movie ,  in my opinion ,  was the worst movie ever made ,  .  .  .  . ever! 
657 1 fascinating i approached i am curious (yellow) and it's companion piece with great trepidation .  i'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex .  what i got wasn't NOT_this ,  but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other .  i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was `lame' or `boring' approached the film as if it were pornography .  perhaps this is pornography ,  assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses ,  but it is intentionally un-erotic .  lena ,  the protagonist ,  throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring .  her breasts may be saggy ,  her nipples unusually large ,  her thighs fat ,  and her face ,  chubby .  but by the end of the film ,  the audience comes to identify with her ,  and accept her faults as human .  this touch gives her even more believability out necessity .  had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified .  i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece .  be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film .  the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream . 
658 0 first: i bought it at the video store .  second: i watched it .  third: it was boring .  fourth: it was not NOT_funny .  fifth: most of the antics were lame .  and last ,  but not NOT_least: NOT_it's NOT_not NOT_only NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie ,  it's a total fiasco . <br /><br />i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film .  i pity it because it was his first movie .  even if you are a huge adam sandler fan ,  don't NOT_bother NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_movie .  instead ,  just take the video ,  board a yacht ,  and throw it overboard . 
659 1 of all the versions of the odyssey (or of any greek mythological story for that matter) ,  this in my opinion is the best of them all .  almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions ,  e . g .  the absence of scylla & charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece , not NOT_some NOT_hollywoodish NOT_sword-and-sandal NOT_b-flick .  notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian ,  if one is familiar with the storyline ,  he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand) .  at least i did ,  and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more . 
660 0 i wanted to punch the tv .  watching it was torture .  i hated it .  never NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie .  the terrorists are annoying .  adam sandler is annoying .  i normally like him but not NOT_in NOT_this NOT_one .  i wanted to break the dvd .  this is the most irritating film in the world .  the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious .  the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls .  it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv .  do not NOT_buy NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_annoy NOT_someone .  if you even like adam sandler a little bit ,  don't NOT_buy NOT_it .  it will just make you hate him .  do yourself a favor ,  if you see it in the store ,  hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it .  its a waste of the $1 . 99 i paid for it . 
661 1 i'm italian and when i've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty: the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it ,  but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings .  now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema (pasolini etc . ) ,  by that time gone .  <br /><br />the hollywood epic films are good .  .  . for fun .  perhaps this 'odyssey' had no NOT_english NOT_version NOT_because NOT_is NOT_not NOT_enough NOT_funny .  .  .  not NOT_suitable NOT_for NOT_pop-corn NOT_and NOT_coke NOT_audience .  however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflections . <br /><br />in italy was recently released a very good dvd version: integral ,  with excellent colors .  you can find it in some file sharing ,  but it's italian only ,  and without subtitles .  too bad: also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable . 
662 0 i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen ,  and yes ,  i have seen cujo .  adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz ,  a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner .  that's the plot . <br /><br /> that's it! nothing else in the film makes sense ,  it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast ,  and not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_wacky NOT_naked NOT_gun NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_way ,  but more of a frustrating ,  'throw both shoes at the t . v' kind of way .  even general noriega makes an appearance ,  for no NOT_reason NOT_i NOT_can NOT_comprehend NOT_(it NOT_certainly NOT_wasn't NOT_for NOT_humour) .  add to the mix miss australia ,  who has the worst australian accent i've ever heared ,  and you have something which i won't NOT_call NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_film NOT_ever NOT_made ,  because going overboard doesn't NOT_even NOT_fit NOT_the NOT_basic NOT_definition NOT_of NOT_a NOT_film .  i highly recomend seeing this film ,  as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see .  i guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be "at least it wasn't NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_going NOT_overboard" . 
663 1 this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies .  it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war .  it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations ,  told at list 500 years after those events toke place ,  around 1100 bc . <br /><br />this is a 1969 movie ,  so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no NOT_other NOT_language NOT_than NOT_italian ,  even the close caption is in italian .  pity .  many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles .  but if this is not NOT_a NOT_problem NOT_for NOT_you ,  than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie . 
664 0 i will start this off by saying i couldn't get all the way through it .  i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site .  i figured there wasn't NOT_any NOT_way NOT_i NOT_would NOT_regret NOT_my NOT_purchase .  was i wrong or what? seriously now ,  who approved this project? they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity .  that's the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad .  the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam .  the acting isnt much better .  i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos .  yay ,  who cares .  .  .  shecky moskowitz is unfunny ,  and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser .  that's about as much of the plot as i understood . <br /><br />overall it's the worst movie i've ever seen .  i own it on dvd and have given it to many co-workers to watch .  each comes back and laughs and says "wow i didnt think i'd ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in .  .  .  . "<br /><br />my response is always "well now you can"<br /><br />

666 0 i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics  ,  and i`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it<br /><br />it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face  .  bad guys enter the temple<br /><br />child sits with blank expression<br /><br />bad guys chop up the monks<br /><br />child sits with blank expression<br /><br />bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with  .  .  .  go on guess ? you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression  ,  this movie would be better titled the wooden child<br /><br />the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily  .  obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated  .  not NOT_only NOT_that NOT_but NOT_it NOT_jars NOT_completely NOT_with NOT_the NOT_somewhat NOT_bloody NOT_opening NOT_ .  in fact that`s the main problem ( and boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together  .  i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too  .  did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? it`s part fantasy  ,  part martial arts  ,  part buddy movie  ,  part comedy and it`s all crap 
667 1 in all honesty ,  this series is as much a classic (as television goes) as the original poem is to the world's literature .  far from being crassly exploitative ,  it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts . <br /><br />i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of troy (which was felt but not NOT_seen); NOT_intrigued NOT_by NOT_the NOT_way NOT_the NOT_gods NOT_played NOT_with NOT_the NOT_fate NOT_of NOT_mortals .  (it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not NOT_ridiculous NOT_cgi NOT_creatures NOT_flitting NOT_around NOT_on NOT_their NOT_ankle NOT_wings ,  or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis .  as in homer's work ,  they act through mortal agents or ,  rarely ,  are represented by classical statuary) . <br /><br />it's a pity it's not NOT_available NOT_in NOT_dvd ,  especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores . 
668 0 bad movie for sure .  it's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects ,  a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example) ,  and a real unfunny time .  (charles dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (last action hero) .  (eddie murphy) is doing a non-comic joking ,  and i heard that this sunk had already succeed ,  big time success??!! i'll never NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_or NOT_how NOT_?!

669 1 it's very simple to qualify that movie: "a pure masterpiece" .  this opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors ,  they seem to be citizens of that epoch ,  1100 b . c .  they personalize perfectly the characters .  a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production .  among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition .  third reason: the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect ,  in mediterranean regions ,  where the action of the poem occurred .  and most of all ,  the emotion is on the rendezvous .  i repeat my appreciation: "a pure masterpiece" . 
670 0 michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in the golden child ,  and because he loves kids .  that didn't NOT_work NOT_(and NOT_why NOT_should NOT_it?) ,  so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing "kid midas" .  i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ishtar .  whatever murphy says or does can be best liked ,  but don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong NOT_about NOT_his NOT_exquisite NOT_comical NOT_talent; NOT_he NOT_doesn't NOT_belong NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie ,  and the same went for dr .  dolittle! the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic ,  and that wouldn't NOT_have NOT_made NOT_any NOT_sense NOT_as NOT_hollywood NOT_and NOT_movie NOT_fanatics NOT_kept NOT_cashing NOT_in NOT_on NOT_the NOT_guy .  speaking of visuals ,  they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan's presidential fame .  murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs ,  but this stale movie isn't NOT_my NOT_touch NOT_of NOT_golden NOT_honey NOT_for NOT_a NOT_sweet NOT_crunchy NOT_taste . 
671 1 i've been trying to find out about this series for ages! thank you ,  imdb! i saw this as a child and have never NOT_quite NOT_been NOT_able NOT_to NOT_get NOT_it NOT_out NOT_of NOT_my NOT_mind .  as a 6-year old ,  of course ,  i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops ,  which was absolutely chilling (i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine ,  which i still have) what i also remember ,  though ,  was the atmosphere ,  which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious ,  austere ,  and extremely authentic .  when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation .  it's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in hollywood .  every 'odyssey' i've seen since has been an enormous let-down .  the characters in this series seemed genuine ,  real people - ancient greek people - and not NOT_some NOT_hollywood NOT_stars NOT_in NOT_costumes .  this is a real masterpiece! but - why is it not NOT_better NOT_known? NOT_and NOT_why NOT_isn't NOT_it NOT_available NOT_on NOT_vhs NOT_or NOT_dvd? NOT_i NOT_would NOT_just NOT_love NOT_to NOT_have NOT_the NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_again! 
672 0 why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain ,  they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? burt reynolds peaked ,  then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks .  arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood ,  only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero .  and here ,  loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this "family" adventure flick ,  which is an unbelievably tedious ,  childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film . <br /><br />the story is pure humdrum .  it concerns social worker murphy ,  contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one .  chosen for what ,  i hear you ask .  his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world .  as the main demon ,  classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film ,  but hey ,  i'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents .  of all murphy's films ,  this is easily the worst .  i've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role ,  in a non formulaic kind of film ,  and while both points are loosely true there's no NOT_forgiving NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film NOT_- NOT_however NOT_atypical NOT_and NOT_non NOT_formulaic NOT_it NOT_might NOT_be NOT_- NOT_is NOT_an NOT_absolute NOT_load NOT_of NOT_garbage . <br /><br /> 
673 1 as it was already put ,  the best version ever of homer's epic .  entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean .  the sea and the sky are strikingly blue ,  the islands green and untouched .  the clothing is linen ,  wool and fur ,  the settings stony and bare ,  everything is somewhat rugged and primitive ,  a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies ,  and it makes it all the more authentic .  although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural ,  it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been like . <br /><br />the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere ,  but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it .  actually ,  it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer ,  if not NOT_to NOT_the NOT_text NOT_itself .  ulysses doesn't NOT_appear NOT_until NOT_the NOT_first NOT_hour ,  the start being centered on his son looking after him .  then he suddenly appears lost in a storm ,  lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him .  his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts : the terrifying cyclop ,  the magic world of circe ,  the underworld ,  the sirens etc .  he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years ,  and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelope . <br /><br />as a story ,  the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life .  the cast is brilliant and international here .  irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope ,  but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses .  really good looking and totally convincing ,  it seems the role was really made for him .  strange that he was never NOT_offered NOT_roles NOT_of NOT_this NOT_dimension NOT_afterwards .  also playing nausicaa is barbara bach (as barbara gregorini) later famous as the james bond girl in "the spy who loved me" ,  and playing athena is michele breton ,  who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called "performance" with mick jagger . <br /><br />as it was done 35 years ago ,  the series was actually quite an innovation for its time ,  as the first big european co-production for tv (italy ,  france ,  germany and yugoslavia) .  i have seen this mini-series in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 .  i was a kid back then ,  and although it was all in black and white ,  it left a very vivid impression .  all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again ,  as it was never NOT_shown NOT_on NOT_french NOT_tv NOT_later NOT_on . <br /><br />i recently found a copy on dvd (all in wonderful color) through internet .  it is unfortunately only in italian with no NOT_subtitles ,  although french and german versions existed back then .  i never NOT_heard NOT_there NOT_was NOT_any NOT_english NOT_version NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is NOT_widely NOT_unknown NOT_in NOT_the NOT_anglo NOT_saxon NOT_world ,  and it's quite a shame .  if you ever get a chance to watch this ,  you are not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_forget NOT_it NOT_ever . <br /><br />there were not NOT_many NOT_versions NOT_of NOT_the NOT_odyssey NOT_before NOT_or NOT_after NOT_that .  the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic sword-and-sandal like "the 10 commandments" ,  but not NOT_as NOT_impressive NOT_and NOT_very NOT_short NOT_for NOT_such NOT_a NOT_complex NOT_story .  the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie ,  based on special effects ,  sometimes quite gory ,  very poorly acted and grossly afar from homer's story and atmosphere . 
674 0 well ,  what's to say .  the golden child falls in the category "so bad ,  it's good" .  eddie murphy is having some funny (and sometimes quite annoying lines) ,  but you are still entertained .  chales dance has never NOT_been NOT_worse NOT_than NOT_his NOT_role NOT_as NOT_the NOT_villain NOT_sardo NOT_numspa NOT_(what NOT_a NOT_f***ed NOT_up NOT_name NOT_is NOT_this??) . <br /><br />who should watch the golden child .  .  .  hm .  .  .  difficult to say ,  but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting ,  bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog . <br /><br />4 out of 10 
675 1 documenting a documenter .  that's one way to describe keep the river on your right: a modern cannibal tale .  this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum ,  who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago ,  first to west papua and then peru .  tobias is a full-bodied character: a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for .  author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru ,  tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become .  yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch .  one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves . <br /><br />tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed .  this film challenges the notions of morality and "naturalness"- e . g .  nudity ,  homosexuality ,  cannibalism .  (watch for the graphic circumcision scene) .  when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce ,  his non-judgmental nature asks: "why not?" who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? this little sleeper is a must watch for not NOT_only NOT_national NOT_geographic NOT_types ,  but also those interested in the art of documentary making .  this film shows what can be done shot on video .  the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination .  at times ,  he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back ,  especially considering his age and physical frailty .  we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself ,  perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world .  the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance ,  presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests .  that said ,  you can't NOT_decide NOT_when NOT_to NOT_stop NOT_being NOT_shocked NOT_and NOT_when NOT_to NOT_take NOT_this NOT_man NOT_home NOT_for NOT_a NOT_cuddle .  move over river queen ,  this is the best river ride i've taken in a while . 
676 0 definitely one of funny man eddie murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child ,  three hundred year old dragons and a "chosen one" . <br /><br />murphy is the "chosen one" in question ,  and as the opening song suggests ,  he is "the best man in the world" .  a finder of lost and missing children ,  he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman (charlotte lewis) who tells him he is "the chosen one" ,  and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "the golden child" .  for if the child were to die ,  compassion would die with him ,  as he is the bearer of compassion . <br /><br />if all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now ,  it surely will once the movie begins .  suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film .  meant to be another vehicle for murphy's egotistical brand of humour (the comedy isn't NOT_so NOT_great NOT_mind NOT_you) ,  the movie fails on many levels .  even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa can't NOT_do NOT_much NOT_for NOT_proceedings .  very silly and disappointing . <br /><br />sunday ,  december 12 ,  1993 - t . v . 
677 1 i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum ,  all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers .  the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right ,  making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent .  equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist .  his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving .  i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian . 
678 0 unlike "the adventures of buckaroo banzai" ,  or "big trouble in little china" ,  or "conan the barbarian" ,  which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations ,  the golden child is just plain bad . <br /><br />the premise itself is not NOT_unworkable ,  and there are some funny moments .  but here the eddy murphy "flip attitude" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story .  and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension .  the "mystic secrets" of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel . <br /><br />without a feeling that anything is at stake ,  or that the characters are faced by real danger ,  why should we care?<br /><br />who should see this film:<br /><br />-- big fans of eddy murphy who can't NOT_help NOT_themselves<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>-- NOT_i NOT_can't NOT_think NOT_of NOT_anyone NOT_else<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i'll NOT_give NOT_this NOT_film NOT_a NOT_4 NOT_out NOT_of NOT_10 NOT_for NOT_the NOT_occasional NOT_joke NOT_that NOT_worked . 
679 1 i read schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life .  his subsequent books were not NOT_as NOT_powerful ,  but showed his continuing quest .  his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's ,  but his honesty and openness about it were welcome .  this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man ,  but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not NOT_a NOT_morally NOT_positive NOT_term ,  in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies .  even so ,  schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness . 
680 0 i am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course eddie murphy .  i think this was his first movie since "beverly hills cop" so at the time he was hot .  considering that one made over two hundred million and it was r and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_popular .  i have never NOT_been NOT_a NOT_big NOT_eddie NOT_murphy NOT_fan ,  so that is probably another reason i didn't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_it NOT_much NOT_at NOT_all .  this one has eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids .  he must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril .  the plot is very bad ,  but as bad as it is it does not NOT_compare NOT_to NOT_the NOT_special NOT_effects .  i had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers ,  ray harryhausen did better stuff .  still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie ,  unfortunately he is not NOT_very NOT_funny NOT_in NOT_this NOT_one NOT_at NOT_all NOT_and NOT_it NOT_just NOT_seems NOT_stupid NOT_to NOT_put NOT_him NOT_in NOT_the NOT_"raiders NOT_of NOT_the NOT_lost NOT_ark" NOT_type NOT_scenes .  i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect ,  but to me it just did not NOT_work . 
681 1 i loved this movie .  when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it!!! it comes out to buy on july 24th!!! it has cool deaths scenes ,  hot girls ,  great cast ,  good story  ,  good acting .  great slasher film .  the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls .  see this movies 
682 0 oh man .  if you want to give your internal crow t .  robot a real workout ,  this is the movie to pop into the ol' vcr .  the potential for cut-up lines in this film is just endless . <br /><br />(minor spoilers ahead .  hey ,  do you really care if a film of this quality is "spoiled?") traci is a girl with a problem .  psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite-sex parent .  but this girl seems to have one for her same-sex one ,  and i don't NOT_think NOT_there's NOT_a NOT_term NOT_for NOT_that .  it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette ,  whose cute overbite ,  neo-flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters .  here dana is not NOT_only NOT_clueless NOT_to NOT_her NOT_daughter's NOT_conduct; NOT_she NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be NOT_competing NOT_for NOT_the NOT_gold NOT_medal NOT_in NOT_the NOT_olympic NOT_indulgent NOT_mother NOT_competition .  <br /><br />it's possible that dana misses traci's murderous streak because truth be told ,  traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster .  it's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count . <br /><br />a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen ,  a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say ,  "i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara . " carmen is so wise to traci's scheming ,  she might also wear a sign saying ,  "hey ,  i'm the next victim!" sure enough ,  traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass ,  and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke .  i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire .  <br /><br />in another sequence ,  arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard ,  under cloudy skies ,  talking to the owner .  cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies ,  talking to the owner's brother .  then cut to her wearing the first dress ,  in the first location ,  under cloudy skies - but it's supposed to be later .  you get the picture .  we're talking really bad directing . <br /><br />as for skin ,  don't NOT_expect NOT_much ,  although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis .  <br /><br />for those looking for a trash wallow ,  8 .  for anybody else ,  1/2 . 
683 1 i really enjoyed this thriller! i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over .  the cast was excellent ,  the plot was suspenseful and entertaining ,  and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen! the girls in it were really cute also ,  especially denise richards .  she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph! 
684 0 this movie is so bad ,  i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person .  very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie<br /><br />do yourself a favour and don't NOT_watch NOT_it NOT_1/10 
685 1 i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes .  .  .  this is definitely really about a 5 . 5 .  .  .  .  .  ummm .  .  it was kind of bloody ,  had likeable ,  shallow characters ,  and it had some really hot babes in it .  i like the eclectic killer ,  because he didn't NOT_kill NOT_people NOT_the NOT_same NOT_way NOT_everytime .  .  .  that sometimes gets old . 
686 0 a truly ,  truly dire canadian-german co-production ,  the ever-wonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few uears prior to the "action" the child murdered her father ,  and mum took the fall for the offspring .  now she's moved up to the northwest us to start over ,  but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother .  so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond . <br /><br />unfortunately mandy schaeffer (as the daughter) murders more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie ,  though the incoherent script ,  useless direction and appalling music (check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini-clad bod) don't NOT_help NOT_any; NOT_we're NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_find NOT_her NOT_sexy NOT_and NOT_scary ,  but she fails on both counts .  almost completely unalluring and not NOT_even NOT_bad NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_be NOT_amusing NOT_(not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_arquette NOT_and NOT_schaeffer NOT_don't NOT_really NOT_convince NOT_as NOT_mother NOT_and NOT_daughter) ,  all condolences to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow ,  both of whom are worthy of far more than this ,  and both of whom (particularly rosanna) are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago . <br /><br />one of the production companies is called quality international films - not NOT_since NOT_the NOT_three-hour NOT_"love ,  lies and murder" (from two short productions) has there been such a "you must be joking" credit . 
687 1 katherine heigl ,  marley shelton ,  denise richards ,  david boreanaz .  even before i knew what this film was about ,  these names were enough to draw me in .  gorgeous ,  talented and popular ,  these are performers to look out for . <br /><br />ok ,  where do i start .  we already know what the film is about .  five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher ,  a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago .  his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards ,  maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose .  his weapon of choice: well ,  take a pick - axe ,  knife ,  electric powerdrill ,  bow and arrow ,  hot iron ,  etc .  ok ,  so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality . <br /><br />horror movies aren't NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_shakespeare ,  but i'm not NOT_gonna NOT_go NOT_there .  i love horror movies ,  but not NOT_all NOT_of NOT_them .  this one ,  i adore .  it's up there with some of my other favorites .  it's funny ,  sexy and scary .  the killer's mask is childishly creepy ,  and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky .  the acting is topnotch: denise richards ,  marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun .  i really did wish to see much ,  much more of katherine heigl .  i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon .  jessica capshaw is a very capable actress ,  and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 .  the smaller parts were also good; hedy buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry . com') and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her . <br /><br />highlights: every death scene had a particular distinction to it .  the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue .  the hottub scene ,  while ludicrous ,  was well done .  and the audiovisual maze was sinister .  the soundtrack is great ,  with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes . <br /><br />lowpoint: i felt as though the killer wasn't NOT_featured NOT_enough ,  we barely saw the mask ,  and it wasn't NOT_featured NOT_at NOT_all NOT_during NOT_the NOT_climax .  i also thought the climax was really unfocused ,  but fun nonetheless . <br /><br />the twist at the end wasn't NOT_that NOT_big NOT_of NOT_a NOT_surprise ,  but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine . <br /><br />i don't NOT_like NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_people NOT_which NOT_movies NOT_they NOT_should NOT_see ,  but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing ,  then valentine would be it . <br /><br />my rating: 10/10 (bullseye!) 
688 0 let me be really clear about this movie .  i didn't NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_plot ,  i watch it for the saucy sex scenes .  that being said ,  this movie is so god damn awful i flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of traci (mandy schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot . <br /><br />spoiler alert the first scene of the movie already had me cringing .  .  you see a woman painting something by the lakeside ,  in pure bliss and serene ,  then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her .  when they both finished ,  they show each other what they had done .  .  .  and the woman painted a vineyard when she is facing infront of the lake .  what kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake?? and in another scene ,  traci gets to kill her teacher's lover by smash him with the sail pole ,  and then she swims away ,  and none of the town's police suspected her once .  i mean hellooooo? mandy did not NOT_wear NOT_a NOT_glove NOT_did NOT_she? NOT_her NOT_finger NOT_prints NOT_are NOT_all NOT_over NOT_the NOT_god NOT_damn NOT_boat!! NOT_after NOT_that ,  it gets worst ,  whenever mandy is around ,  there is the "chilling" sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit .  it's also a real pity rosanna arquette's is in this movie .  i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no NOT_brainer .  same goes for jã¼rgen prochnow ,  who also has the misfortune to star in this movie .  all in all ,  2/10 . 
689 1 another entry in the "holiday horror" category that fills the shelves of your local video store .  the *spoiler* "wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him" plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before .  and those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it .  marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz ,  denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it .  oh ,  and i loved the creepy mask . 
690 0 this can't NOT_be NOT_mandy NOT_schaffer's NOT_last NOT_film .  somebody ,  do something! :-(<br /><br />argh . <br /><br />what little life this one might have had ,  the directing finished off .  don't NOT_blame NOT_the NOT_cast; NOT_they NOT_did NOT_ok .  even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done ,  and he didn't NOT_even NOT_get NOT_into NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_until NOT_halfway NOT_through .  and please ,  please put mandy in some more movies! she's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age .  ya' breakin' my haht ,  heah .  .  .  . <br /><br />two specific criticisms ,  in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much) .  first ,  the way traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment ,  in order to see whatever she was supposed to see ,  and never NOT_got NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_return ,  was very annoying .  hollywood: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives .  it's dumb .  write better scripts so you won't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_use NOT_that NOT_lame NOT_plot NOT_device NOT_any NOT_more .  if your script isn't NOT_good NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_stand NOT_up NOT_without NOT_that ,  then don't NOT_produce NOT_it . <br /><br />second ,  carmen wouldn't NOT_have NOT_fallen NOT_for NOT_that NOT_fake NOT_injury NOT_trick NOT_that NOT_traci NOT_pulled .  she already had traci fingered .  more bad writing/directing there . <br /><br />i could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it .  actually i didn't NOT_hate NOT_it NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_the NOT_others NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_have .  it just didn't NOT_have NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_reason NOT_for NOT_being NOT_made ,  unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely mandy .  oh ,  and to whoever didn't NOT_think NOT_she NOT_was NOT_sexy .  .  .  the character wasn't NOT_very NOT_well NOT_written ,  but how can you say she wasn't NOT_sexy?!? NOT_one NOT_or NOT_the NOT_other NOT_of NOT_us NOT_needs NOT_glasses ,  and i don't NOT_think NOT_it's NOT_me . <br /><br />more mandy .  (not to be confused with "moore ,  mandy" -- although i'd like to see her again too .  ;-)<br /><br />p . s .  did i mention i hope mandy makes me more movies? <:-d 
691 1 the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least .  however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced .  apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end ,  the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie .  the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist') .  in those scenes ,  there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it .  the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore . 
692 0 because it is ,  that's why! this is the same jealous-daughter-kills-people flick we've seen a billion times .  rosanna arquette makes anything worth watching ,  and mandy schaffer's brief nude scene (after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film) at the end almost make this trite blarney worthwhile ,  but not NOT_quite . <br /><br />* out of **** 
693 1 what an awesome movie! it was very scary ,  great acting ,  well-written ,  nice plot twists ,  interesting characters ,  very good direction ,  and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face .  this is one popcorn horror flick that may not NOT_be NOT_appealing NOT_to NOT_non-horror NOT_fans ,  but is still (nonetheless) one of the best thrillers out there today! i highly recommend it to only fans of:<br /><br />1) the horror genre<br /><br />or<br /><br />2) an actor or actress featured in it . <br /><br />*** out of **** stars!<br /><br />ps- i am sick and tired of people comparing this ,  and other modern horror movies ,  with scream .  ya know what ,  they didn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_be NOT_like NOT_scream .  everyone's like "oh ,  they copied scream!" .  well ,  if i am not NOT_mistaking ,  scream also copied other movies too! in fact ,  just about every horror movie copied an earlier one .  scream ,  however ,  was a good film .  but ,  still .  .  .  stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is!<br /><br />go and rent this one!<br /><br />

695 1 valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films .  the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good .  marley shelton did great as the female lead (much better than jennifer love hewitt in the "i know .  .  . " films) .  david boreanaz ,  whom is the main reason i saw this movie ,  had a pretty small role ,  but he played it well .  the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards .  she was horrible in this .  the only scene i was glad to see her in was *spoiler* her death scene .  all in all ,  it's a good movie to watch .  you should definitely watch this before you watch "scream" or "i know .  .  . " again . 
696 0 this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle .  the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw ,  fishburne ,  and the usually solid ed harris .  connery seems miscast as a harvard academic .  the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along .  it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels .  the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast .  george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty .  the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery/thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree .  the scripting and direction are extremely poor .  connery's charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue .  manipulative ,  violent ,  and ridiculous .  2/10 avoid it . 
697 1 these slasher pics are past their sell by date ,  but this one is good fun . <br /><br />the valentine cards themselves are witty ,  and well thought out . <br /><br />the film has one peach of a line .  .  .  "he's no NOT_angel .  .  .  . " when he in fact is angel!!! watching buffy reruns will never NOT_be NOT_the NOT_same!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>the NOT_cast NOT_is NOT_a NOT_sizzling NOT_display NOT_of NOT_young NOT_talent ,  but the story does not NOT_give NOT_them NOT_enough NOT_real NOT_depth .  denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters .  sorry but no!<br /><br />the direction is very good ,  managing to show very little actual gore ,  and relying on your imaginations implied threat .  much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not NOT_remove NOT_their NOT_clothes .  .  . :-(<br /><br />essentially ,  the main directorial plus ,  lies within the "borrowing" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks .  psycho's shower scene is tributed ,  along with halloween's "masking" .  <br /><br />murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know!!!<br /><br />light viewing ,  not NOT_very NOT_scary NOT_but NOT_a NOT_few NOT_good NOT_jump NOT_moments .  if it was a choice between the hole and this though ,  choose the hole .  slasher movies have had their day ,  and this is just another slasher .  a very good slasher ,  but nothing groundbreaking!!! 
698 0 a pot - boiler if ever i saw one .  a supposed thriller borrowing from "a time to kill" ,  "silence of the lambs" ,  even an inverted "in the heat of the night" with a little reverse murder ,  a la "strangers on a train" thrown in ,  it fails abysmally where all the above ,  to a large degree ,  succeeded .  namely ,  in delivering thrills .  the plot seems condensed from a bigger book ,  making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving ,  while the direction lacks pace and verve .  to rein in any kudos ,  a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too .  connery is clearly slowing down in his old age ,  barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his .  he even has a father in law who seems younger than him .  laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy .  someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie - they do ,  confusedly ,  here .  the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles .  the supposed climax managed too ,  to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back ,  not NOT_as NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_the NOT_aim ,  front edge of my seat .  mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure . 
699 1 call me stupid ,  but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie ,  valentine .  it was so well-made ,  well-written ,  well-acted ,  well-directed ,  etc! everything about it was wonderful! there were parts that were relatively routine (lily's death) ,  very funny (www . bleed-me-dry . com) ,  completely horrifying and creepy (paige's death) ,  and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene) .  i think the entire cast did a great job ,  especially the three leads: david boreanaz ,  denise richards (both of whom i met ,  and got autographs from ,  during the filming of this movie - very nice people!) ,  and marley shelton . <br /><br />i am very sick of people calling this movie "another scream clone" .  this movie is ,  in no NOT_way ,  a scream clone .  in fact ,  this film runs rings around scream .  it actually makes sense! scream was also not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_feature NOT_a NOT_masked NOT_killer NOT_in NOT_it .  excuse me ,  but it looks like scream was also a clone too (ahem .  .  .  ,  friday the 13th ,  halloween ,  and many other scary movies also featured masked killers) .  i also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant .  it's so strange to see a sweet ,  cupid face doing all of these horrible things .  another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! the ending gives me chills every time i see it!!!!! so ,  even if you didn't NOT_like NOT_it NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time ,  watch valentine again and give it another chance!<br /><br />ps- keep an eye out for my new website (www . love-hurts . org)! coming soon .  .  . 
700 0 the performances of fishbourne (who appears strangely funny somehow) and (short featured)ed harris are remarkable ,  unlike connery's who doesn't NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_find NOT_sense NOT_in NOT_his NOT_role NOT_and NOT_ends NOT_up NOT_in NOT_the NOT_motorial NOT_behaviour NOT_of NOT_a NOT_80yr NOT_old NOT_man .  in fact the screenplay doesn't NOT_make NOT_sense; NOT_imagine NOT_a NOT_60 NOT_min .  happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters .  it's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights' schools .  the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets .  the capital punishment is not NOT_an NOT_issue NOT_here ,  although it is a subject from the beginning; it sort of fades away without further comment .  the subject-matter and environment could have been good . 
701 1 i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever .  when i watched valentine ,  i was amazed at how great the story line actually was .  it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not NOT_horrible NOT_at NOT_all .  the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning .  some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor ,  and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring ,  but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful .  it had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't NOT_deserve NOT_all NOT_the NOT_crap NOT_it NOT_gets .  i recommend this movie to watch anytime ,  but especially on valentine's day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills .  oh ,  and don't NOT_even NOT_pay NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_the NOT_trailer NOT_or NOT_rating ,  please ,  don't .  .  . 
702 0 1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10(dir-arne glimcher): mystery??/thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists .  despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it's audience .  the movie-going public is not NOT_stupid NOT_and NOT_i NOT_hope NOT_will NOT_not NOT_keep NOT_filling NOT_certain NOT_stars NOT_pockets NOT_again NOT_and NOT_again NOT_despite NOT_what NOT_they NOT_are NOT_involved NOT_with .  we think that this movie is going to be about something with connery's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard ,  contrived for the audience's sake ,  run of the mill ,  let's never NOT_get NOT_it NOT_over NOT_with ,  thriller .  we are pulled into every silly switch in character ,  as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story ,  and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends .  yes there is some good acting here ,  especially from blair underwood ,  fishburne ,  and ed harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not NOT_work NOT_from NOT_almost NOT_the NOT_beginning NOT_to NOT_the NOT_very NOT_long-awaited NOT_end . 
703 1 it's a colorful slasher movie .  that's about it . <br /><br />it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies ,  but i never NOT_care NOT_for NOT_such NOT_things .  figuring out who's the bad guy is not NOT_that NOT_interesting NOT_considering NOT_the NOT_clues NOT_are NOT_all NOT_misleading NOT_anyway . <br /><br />the death scenes were inventive and gorey ,  bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th .  <br /><br />another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl ,  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious .  <br /><br />people who don't NOT_like NOT_slasher NOT_movies NOT_won't NOT_like NOT_this NOT_movie .  as simple as that .  i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same .  <br /><br />--mb 
704 0 seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie .  and so i sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief .  beside ed harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting .  even sean connery ,  who i normally worship ,  must have had an off-day during the entire filming of just case .  not NOT_once NOT_in NOT_during NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_movie NOT_one NOT_actor NOT_could NOT_convince NOT_me . <br /><br />this made this movie look cheap and unreal . <br /><br />the story makes up a little .  it is thrilling ,  and the plot is unexpected . <br /><br />conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do . 
705 1 i just saw "valentine" and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years .  unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks ,  this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking .  for those out there that hated "scream , " there is not NOT_one NOT_reference NOT_to NOT_"the NOT_horror NOT_rules" NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_(even NOT_though NOT_the NOT_old NOT_slasher NOT_movie NOT_rules NOT_do NOT_apply NOT_here) .  <br /><br />this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror .  you get the style ,  cinematography ,  and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick .  i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for .  this is definitely a move in the right direction . <br /><br />denise richards stands out here as a fun character .  you can tell she liked her role ,  and that makes her stand out .  i loved her in this movie . 
706 0 as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour .  however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw ,  who clearly never NOT_found NOT_her NOT_character NOT_and NOT_ruins NOT_every NOT_scene NOT_she's NOT_in .  connery is fine as is fishbourne ,  but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality .  and the ending is simply bizarre .  the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner ,  so to compensate they added an overloud "dramatic" score .  every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration ,  to the point where it becomes laughable .  if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see ,  otherwise skip it . 
707 1 i'm not NOT_a NOT_follower NOT_of NOT_a NOT_certain NOT_movie NOT_genre .  i classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial .  valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks ,  after his urban legends .  unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak .  yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic ,  and that is what makes valentine the best .  <br /><br />as the first basic and iconic element ,  the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth .  since his secondary school years ,  he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends ,  who have made fun of him .  when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie ,  you will come to see this point of view of humanism: "noone is entirely good or evil .  in fact ,  somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted . " just because the story line and the direction is very weak ,  we are not NOT_as NOT_satisfied NOT_as NOT_we NOT_deserved .  <br /><br />the second iconic element is ,  of course ,  the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed .  an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in ,  while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date ,  never NOT_able NOT_to NOT_met NOT_with .  katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables .  denise richards is killed third ,  while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath .  jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way ,  then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer .  marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never NOT_know ,  'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed .  finally ,  benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not NOT_a NOT_classmate NOT_of NOT_the NOT_serial NOT_killer ,  david boreanaz . <br /><br />the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene ,  the valentines' day celebration at dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes .  everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know .  hard rock never NOT_suits NOT_better NOT_within NOT_a NOT_serial NOT_killer-mystery NOT_movie . 
708 0 look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie: connery ,  fishburne ,  capshaw ,  harris ,  underwood ,  beatty ,  thigpen ,  even cameos by slezak ,  lange ,  and plimpton .  they prove ,  in spades ,  the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script .  the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards .  it's not NOT_particularly NOT_original ,  and the "twists" are downright cruel . 
709 1 a group of model-caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine's day cards .  who is the killer and why is the killer after them? <br /><br />my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up ,  sometimes slightly down .  however ,  i can't NOT_remember NOT_another NOT_film NOT_where NOT_my NOT_rating NOT_has NOT_changed NOT_as NOT_drastically NOT_as NOT_it NOT_has NOT_for NOT_valentine .  the first time i watched it ,  upon its theatrical release ,  i thought it was pretty awful--i gave it a 4 out of 10 ,  the equivalent of an "f" letter grade .  watching it for a second time last night ,  i can't NOT_remember NOT_what NOT_the NOT_heck NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_like NOT_about NOT_it .  i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it ,  or maybe i just didn't NOT_get NOT_it .  in any event ,  i loved it this time ,  giving it a 9 out of 10 ,  or an "a" . <br /><br />it might sound ridiculous saying i didn't NOT_get NOT_a NOT_film NOT_like NOT_this ,  but there is something to get .  valentine is almost a comedy/horror .  director jamie blanks ,  who was also responsible for 1998's urban legend ,  takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch ,  making valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term) .  on top of that ,  he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships .  the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects .  most of the situations in the film ,  and the modus operandi of the villain ,  humorous or not ,  are tied in to the valentine's day theme . <br /><br />many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichã©-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments .  however ,  in light of the above ,  the film is intentionally clichã©d ,  implausible and ludicrous .  it's as if blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros .  that's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine's day .  it's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film ,  and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre ,  making it prime fodder for valentine's extravagant lampooning .  scream had a similar aim with its horror material ,  but the twist there was that the film was "self-aware" .  valentine's day is intentionally not NOT_self-aware; NOT_the NOT_viewer NOT_has NOT_to NOT_rely NOT_on NOT_contextual NOT_clues NOT_for NOT_satire .  lest some think i'm "reading too much" into the film ,  it's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he "didn't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend" and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something "more adult" . <br /><br />other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine's day differs so much from its putative source material ,  the novel of the same name by tom savage .  the novel's characters ,  setting and plot are very different from the film .  sellers has said ,  "while it was a fine book ,  i didn't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_was NOT_the NOT_right NOT_story NOT_for NOT_a NOT_film" .  so instead the novel ,  which is much dryer and more serious in tone ,  was used as a launching pad ,  a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on valentine's day .  while those facts won't NOT_help NOT_purists NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_the NOT_book NOT_like NOT_the NOT_film ,  it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude .  it's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme . <br /><br />blanks' direction is impeccable visually .  valentine's day has a lush look throughout ,  with complex ,  deep colors ,  interesting sets ,  and good staging .  blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not NOT_too NOT_dark ,  with clearly conveyed action .  he also directs his actors with aplomb ,  catalyzing often slyly humorous performances .  david boreanaz ,  as adam carr ,  is involved in many of the funniest moments . <br /><br />while valentine's day is no NOT_masterpiece ,  it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions .  if you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more . 
710 0 just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris .  then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw) and kid (a very young scarlet johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack .  <br /><br />the kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane ,  and even then only once . 
711 1 i ,  like many horror fans ,  have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years .  here ,  at last ,  is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes . <br /><br />you want a hot lead actress ,  you want vampires ,  you want cool weapons ,  you want cool vehicles and you want blood ,  lots of it ,  by the bucket load - you got it . <br /><br />with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham ,  this really is fantastic stuff . <br /><br />despite it's low budget ,  by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix ,  director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger . <br /><br />a must for old school horror fans . 
712 0 the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker .  there are surprises ,  twists and turns ,  reverses and excitements .  at times ,  this is truly an "edge-of-the-seat" film .  but it disappoints ,  and disappoints severely . <br /><br />the villain of the piece is not NOT_believeable; NOT_his NOT_character NOT_does NOT_not NOT_hold NOT_together .  i refuse to "spoil" the film ,  but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not NOT_be NOT_he NOT_whom NOT_we NOT_see NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end . <br /><br />the second major disappointment of the film is that--finally ,  it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film .  there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "friday the 13th" films .  not NOT_that NOT_every NOT_film NOT_need NOT_always NOT_be NOT_totally NOT_tasteful ,  but this film does drip gore on occasion . <br /><br />though the film features the magnificent sean connery ,  even he does not NOT_measure NOT_up NOT_to NOT_his NOT_usual NOT_standard ,  and often just seems to be walking through the paces . 
713 1 turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget .  the variety of characters is amazing ,  from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! i enjoyed the relationship between the leads ,  not NOT_overly NOT_sentimental NOT_but NOT_romantic NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_the NOT_interest NOT_going .  i also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong ,  too much/not enough) which meant it didn't NOT_get NOT_too NOT_dark ,  nor too spoofy .  it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts ,  hellbreeder and sanitarium ,  in terms of storyline and production .  they have a great website which is worth checking out .  can't NOT_wait NOT_for NOT_bane ,  if the level of improvement continues ,  it should be fantastic . 
714 0 just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof ,  kate capshaw (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer . <br /><br />weird casting ,  but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience .  (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) first of all ,  i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no NOT_evidence .  the coroner ,  witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black . <br /><br />connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty .  he is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial . <br /><br />connery is stonewalled (yawn .  .  . ) by the small town officials and the good il' boys club but finds that the case against blair ,  the alleged killer ,  now on death row ,  was all fabricated .  the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him . <br /><br />the beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him .  connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting ,  hannibal lecter-like ed harris ,  he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon . <br /><br />he gets a re-trial and blair is freed . <br /><br />i think .  .  .  film over .  .  .  . <br /><br />then suddenly! it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to enlist connery .  he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris . <br /><br />now blair is on the loose again ,  thanks to connery's deluded pc principles! the final 30 min .  are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama ,  connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes ,  you read that right) in the everglades . <br /><br />that was one weird film . <br /><br />so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient ,  the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers ,  but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry . <br /><br />truly depressing on every level! the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too . <br /><br />two thumbs down .  connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something . 
715 1 the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast ,  and excellent direction by james eves .  the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast .  james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action ,  fall and then rise to a climax .  he does this with an element of humour ,  plenty of twists ,  thrills and blood .  this is a return of the old vampire movie ,  with loads of gore ,  blood and screams .  the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure , but what makes it work is that the film doesn't NOT_take NOT_itself NOT_too NOT_seriously NOT_with NOT_plenty NOT_of NOT_tongue NOT_in NOT_cheek NOT_action . great ! 
716 0 paul armstrong is a liberal ,  scottish-born ,  professor of law at harvard ,  known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty ,  who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl ,  a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver ,  an eleven year old white girl .  earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan ,  a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders .  armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row ,  hoping to persuade him to confess to joanie's murder ,  thereby saving earl from the electric chair .  <br /><br />at first all goes well .  sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction .  as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film ,  it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer .  "warning! major plot twist ahead!" and so it proves .  the anticipated twist soon materialises .  earl ,  it transpires ,  is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted ,  and probably of several others as well ,  but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom; sullivan will confess to joanie's murder if earl will murder his parents .  (just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never NOT_precisely NOT_explained) .  armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved; earl has a grudge against armstrong's wife ,  herself a lawyer ,  who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape .  <br /><br />"just cause" is an example of the auto-cannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge ,  cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others .  the first half owes an obvious debt to films like "intruder in the dust" and "to kill a mockingbird"; about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black ,  whereas in earlier films he would have been white .  (police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity) .  the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costa-gavras's "music box" ,  although in that film the revelation does not NOT_occur NOT_until NOT_the NOT_very NOT_end .  the finale ,  in which a lawyer ,  his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client ,  is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of "cape fear" ,  which also take place in the swamplands of the american south .  ed harris' characterisation of sullivan as a bible-quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niro's character in the scorsese version of "cape fear" ,  made four years before "just cause" .  <br /><br />(there is a postscript .  just as "just cause" borrowed heavily from several other movies ,  seven years later its central plot twist was ,  in its turn ,  to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle "high crimes") .  <br /><br />the trouble with this style of film-making-by-numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them .  the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts ,  and "just cause" is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it .  harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances ,  largely because he is not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_playing NOT_a NOT_character NOT_as NOT_playing NOT_de NOT_niro NOT_playing NOT_max NOT_cady .  blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the (supposedly) innocent young man of the early scenes ,  but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones .  sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better ,  but neither is good enough to save the film .  (connery and harris were to act together in another ,  better ,  film ,  "the rock" ,  the following year) .  <br /><br />there is another problem with "just cause" .  the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal "issue" movie ,  anti-death penalty ,  anti-racist and critical of heavy-handed policing .  the second half looks more like the work of a die-hard reactionary ,  preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards ,  that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair ,  that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes .  the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the (presumably unwanted) effect of reversing its political stance ,  or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it .  a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency .  4/10 
717 1 the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life .  every character had an element of the color purple in them .  the movie touches on love ,  lost ,  hope ,  hate ,  and triumph .  whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister ,  and shug coming into her life to show her love again ,  albert not NOT_being NOT_man NOT_righting NOT_his NOT_wrong NOT_toward NOT_celie ,  shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end ,  sofia and her stubborness good and bad ,  and even nettie ,  they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that's the sign of a good movie .  good job to all the cast and crew . 
718 0 i've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films ,  but i don't NOT_recall NOT_any NOT_film NOT_that NOT_committed NOT_outright NOT_suicide NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one NOT_did . <br /><br />the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all .  .  .  .  and it did ,  but perhaps not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_way NOT_the NOT_directors NOT_had NOT_hoped .  i was left feeling surprised that connery ,  harris ,  fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey ,  individually or collectively . <br /><br />the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall .  but once the twist was revealed ,  the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable ,  the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far-fetched .  what's worse is that ,  once the twist was revealed ,  the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable . <br /><br />harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never NOT_gives NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_performance ,  even if the movie ain't NOT_that NOT_great! NOT_so NOT_all NOT_in NOT_all ,  it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested .  the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema .

720 0 i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end .  however ,  when i saw the movie i was very disappointed .  first of all ,  no NOT_disrespect NOT_to NOT_deborah NOT_raffin NOT_but NOT_she NOT_was NOT_too NOT_mature NOT_to NOT_play NOT_a NOT_woman NOT_of NOT_24/25 .  the late christopher reeve was also miscast-same reason .  will ,  according to the book , was around 30 .  i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life ,  his friend red ,  elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development .  also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady .  i know the movie didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_budget NOT_of NOT_the NOT_"bridges NOT_of NOT_madison NOT_county" NOT_which NOT_i NOT_believe NOT_was NOT_released NOT_around NOT_the NOT_same NOT_time .  <br /><br />but to me this was a very poorly made ,  low budget ,  miscast movie .  as someone mentioned ,  i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be .  she knows her characters better than anyone ,  i hope that she would consider doing the casting too .  the movie let me down!

722 0 after reading the book ,  i loved the story .  watching the movie i was disappointed that so many changes were made .  it is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories ,  only the names and some of the book's story remained .  read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie .  the book gives you a better development of the characters .  these characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them .  the locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions .  some characters not NOT_included .  television has microwaved so many great books and stories ,  this is a perfect example of that .  input from the author doesn't NOT_always NOT_insure NOT_a NOT_good NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_it NOT_can NOT_help NOT_sometimes .

724 0 not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_confused NOT_with NOT_the NOT_madonna NOT_film NOT_"the NOT_next NOT_best NOT_thing" ,  "the last big thing" is a silly ,  campy ,  off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called "the next big thing" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists .  this low budget indie makes "chuck and buck" look like a masterpiece .  fraught with lousy acting ,  poor sets and costuming ,  etc .  ,  " .  .  . thing" has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award .  pass on this one . 
725 1 in the year 1985 (my birth year) steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african-american girl celie (debut role for whoopi goldberg) whose life is followed through rough times .  the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old .  she has given birth two children for her father .  celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable .  a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him .  it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling .  women are inferior of men and especially being an african-american woman their rights are less than a zero .  celie's story is a true survival story . <br /><br />"the color purple" is a master-piece and underestimated film of spielberg .  he should make more drama which "the color purple" and "schindler's list" are good notion . <br /><br />the cast is amazing .  whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama .  danny glover was surprisingly nasty "mister" .  i have never NOT_seen NOT_him NOT_in NOT_a NOT_such NOT_an NOT_evil NOT_role .  the talk-show icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed sofia . <br /><br />warning! prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film .  you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood .  especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister . <br /><br />big applauds to mr .  spielberg! 
726 0 what ends up killing this movie is its self-consciousness ,  among other things .  here's a short list: 1 .  irreverent behavior .  when the beatles came over and injected their brand of "quirky ,  irreverent" behavior/humor ,  it was greeted as fresh .  that was over 4 decades ago .  get over it . <br /><br />2 .  false sophistication .  spewing out base ,  quasi-socio-political-isms is hard ground to make work comically .  ask woody allen . <br /><br />3 .  the post-modern "i'm hard on this phony world and yes ,  i recognize it in myself" snake eating itself - used as illustration with another animal in the film itself! - is such a retread . <br /><br />4 .  smarmy ,  smug drollness . <br /><br />5 .  amateurish writing ,  acting ,  direction .  .  .  ever seen student films? a victim of itself ,  about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself ,  and sheesh ,  now i'm getting caught up in the self-reflexive thing that it posits as worthwhile ,  of value . <br /><br />but towards .  .  .  what? ultimately ,  it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hey ,  ever see woody allen's take on bergman ,  ie: "interiors"??? well ,  this just does it more amateurishly . 
727 1 this movie is about development .  people growing and people fading ,  people surprising and people disappointing .  it has it all and more .  there is hope ,  frustration ,  injustice ,  justice ,  love and hate .  it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut role . <br /><br />this movie made me feel very human and proud of it ,  and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion .  rating: 10 of 10 . <br /><br />ps: i admit it: i shed a tear of joy during the final scene . 
728 0 larry buchanan .  yep ,  same guy who did "attack of the the eye creatures" and two (count 'em: two) conspiracy movies about marilyn monroe .  he's to blame ,  here . <br /><br />adding onto his ever-growing pile of folders left over from oliver stone's "eh-i-grew-out-of-it" conspiracy drawer ,  here's "down on us (i . e . - "beyond the doors") which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy . <br /><br />forget everything you thought you knew about jimi hendrix ,  janis joplin and jim morrison ,  says big lar' ,  cuz this is the real deal! y'see ,  the three big names in rock of the '60s were killed by the government because they were subversives or counter-productive to truth ,  justice and the american way ,  or sumpthin' like that there .  i knew it all along . <br /><br />anyway ,  three people (chatman ,  meryl ,  wolf) who look eerily like their real life shadows (that is ,  if you completely close your eyes ,  turn your backs and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths ,  the good old us of a put hits out on them! yep ,  it's the truth!<br /><br />man ,  i cannot believed i watched this movie .  it's facts ,  when not NOT_stretching NOT_credibility NOT_to NOT_the NOT_snapping NOT_point ,  are ludicrous; the acting makes tv commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end ,  you deserve the "twist" ending .  you really ,  really do; i swear .  genius . <br /><br />but like the man said: "rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll . "<br /><br />not this flick ,  though . <br /><br />no stars for "down on us" .  and that's the movie audience describing the film ,  by the way .  .  .  . 
729 1 steven speilberg's adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not NOT_without NOT_its NOT_share NOT_of NOT_controversy .  when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men ,  while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women . <br /><br />this is the story of a young black woman named celie ,  growing up in rural america after the turn of the century .  she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth .  her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister . <br /><br />celie (played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg) is married off to an abusive husband (danny glover) .  the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celie's life . <br /><br />the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children .  throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters ,  including sophia ,  a tough as nails wife to her step son ,  and shug ,  a loud and luscious saloon singer ,  who teaches her a thing or two about love . <br /><br />speilberg's direction is all over this picture ,  which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances .  i dare you to watch this film and not NOT_be NOT_moved! NOT_the NOT_film NOT_the NOT_color NOT_purple NOT_manages NOT_to NOT_capture NOT_the NOT_essence NOT_of NOT_what NOT_is NOT_a NOT_complicated NOT_story .  while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story ,  both of which were so vivid in the book ,  the movie remains true to its themes ,  allowing the voice of alice walker to shine through . <br /><br />i couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film .  suffice it to say ,  however ,  this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again ,  and which has left an indelible mark on me . <br /><br /> 
730 0 bad plot ,  bad dialogue ,  bad acting ,  idiotic directing ,  the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script ,  and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor .  trust me ,  because i stuck this turkey out to the end .  it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of springtime for hitler . <br /><br />the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest ,  and that was only because she could sing better than the original . <br /><br />if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better ,  then watch beyond the valley of the dolls . 
731 1 this is an excellent film ,  with an extraordinary cast and acting .  i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didn't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_oscar NOT_for NOT_best NOT_film NOT_and NOT_for NOT_best NOT_actress NOT_(woopi NOT_goldberg) .  .  .  it certainly deserved it .  in any case ,  take a look at it .  i am sure you will enjoy it very much . 
732 0 bad actors ,  bad filming ,  choppy dialog ,  shallow characters ,  but then again it was a bad premise in the first place .  basically ,  an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal .  of course ,  the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house ,  cash a check for 1 , 000 , 000 dollars ,  and even foil three bumbling idiots ,  reminiscent of the three stooges .  <br /><br />preston blake is an annoying ,  obnoxious ,  boy ,  who decides that ,  when written a blank check by a complete stranger ,  he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can .  in other words ,  he wanders into a bank ,  <br /><br />hands a teller a check he makes in his printer ,  and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash .  preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle ,  due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10-speed could not NOT_catch NOT_him ,  even when preston jumped a row of cars . <br /><br />of course ,  with every hokey adventure movie ,  there has to be hot heroine .  in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston ,  and promises another date when he turns 17 .  <br /><br />however ,  the absolute worst aspect of this film was not NOT_its NOT_casting ,  nor its sloppy dialog ,  such as "the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur" .  it was ,  rather ,  the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not NOT_give NOT_a NOT_damn NOT_about NOT_random NOT_people NOT_ .  what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias "macintosh" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts .  of course ,  the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston ,  who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face ,  then treat her to hamburgers ,  finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground .  our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two ,  as they make their way to preston's limousine ,  complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never NOT_fails NOT_to NOT_provide NOT_cheap ,  3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on . <br /><br />overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film .  i don't NOT_see NOT_how NOT_it NOT_only NOT_has NOT_a NOT_4 . 4/10 . 
733 1 this movie is so wonderful ,  it's hard to find words to describe it .  this is the only time i can't NOT_decide NOT_which NOT_was NOT_better ,  the book or the movie . <br /><br />whoopi goldberg is awesome ,  and oprah winfrey ,  such a good actress ,  she could be funny ,  happy and miserable all at the same time .  all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg ,  and should not NOT_be NOT_passed NOT_up .  9/10 
734 0 a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up .  unfortunately ,  the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad .  he wants his loot back .  when he discovers who has the bucks ,  he begins trying to get it back .  he keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man's hands .  sounds familiar ,  i'll bet .  very predictable ,  not NOT_interesting NOT_at NOT_all .  come up with something a bit different ,  ok guys? 
735 1 "the color purple" ,  is truly amazing .  there is none like it ,  and i don't NOT_think NOT_there NOT_ever NOT_will NOT_be .  it's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on .  the actors are flawless and the directing is superb .  i absolutely loved it .  a movie has never NOT_made NOT_me NOT_so NOT_happy .  it is beautiful ,  that's the best way to explain it . 
736 0 this movie is really goofy! i saw it as an 11 year old ,  and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous! i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 .  i really didn't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_it ,  but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of ,  such as: 1)does money buy happiness? 2)should i lie (to my parents) about things i think they wouldn't NOT_approve NOT_of? NOT_3)does NOT_money NOT_buy NOT_friendships? NOT_4)is NOT_money NOT_everything? NOT_5)shouldn't NOT_i NOT_tell NOT_my NOT_parents NOT_when NOT_someone NOT_is NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_hurt NOT_me? NOT_granted ,  these are very unrealistic situations ,  but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children ,  maybe they should watch this video as well ,  in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt . 
737 1 the color purple is a masterpiece .  it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg ,  oprah winfrey ,  and danny glover .  not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_steven NOT_spielberg NOT_the NOT_most NOT_incredible NOT_director NOT_of NOT_all NOT_time NOT_but NOT_his NOT_versatility NOT_shines NOT_through NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this .  it's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time! 
738 0 i almost called hbo and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie .  i can just see the movie execs sitting around going ,  "okay ,  we need to come up with something that's just like home alone ,  only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid ,  hire cut-rate actors ,  and oh yeah ,  we'll make it a lot less funny!"<br /><br />okay ,  maybe not NOT_the NOT_last NOT_part ,  but that's basically what you've got here .  not NOT_even NOT_worth NOT_seeing NOT_if NOT_someone NOT_else NOT_rents NOT_it .  and as a movie for kids? forget it .  i wouldn't NOT_let NOT_my NOT_kids NOT_see NOT_this ,  not NOT_necessarily NOT_because NOT_of NOT_bad-taste NOT_jokes ,  but because i wouldn't NOT_want NOT_them NOT_to NOT_say ,  "what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage ,  dad?!?!" 
739 1 absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time .  i have seen it at least a hundred times and i can't NOT_go NOT_through NOT_it NOT_without NOT_crying .  i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie ,  or shug and father and not NOT_feel NOT_your NOT_eyes NOT_getting NOT_misty .  whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal .  and for the person who said you can't NOT_love NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_if NOT_you NOT_loved NOT_the NOT_book ,  wrong! im a testament to that . 
740 0 blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties .  the plot is completely pointless; its overtones of lonliness are pathetic .  do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film ,  like buying a mansion for a mere $300 grand .  the notion ,  let alone the bargain-basement price ,  will only be believed by the most gullible viewers .  please ,  respect your intelligence and don't NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_awful ,  awful film . 
741 1 i've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it . <br /><br />the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg ,  oprah winfrey ,  danny glover ,  and margaret avery .  akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettie . <br /><br />you'll experience every human emotion while watching this film .  i laughed ,  cried ,  and got angry .  like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no NOT_wins .  but this movie ,  without a doubt ,  is definitely one of the best films of all time . 
742 0 the worst movie i have seen in a while .  yeah its fun to fantasize ,  but if that is what you are looking for ,  i suggest you see brewsters millions .  this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny .  unless you are five or like terrible movies ,  don't NOT_see NOT_this NOT_one . 
743 1 i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not NOT_win NOT_in NOT_any NOT_category .  for the life of me ,  i cannot remember what it was up against ,  but one thing i can say: it was one of the best movies i have ever seen .  and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not NOT_persuade NOT_me NOT_one NOT_bit . <br /><br />essentially ,  it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman .  there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying ,  but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with .  along the way ,  we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption .  whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie .  danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film .  <br /><br />and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely ,  not NOT_like NOT_some NOT_sideshow NOT_freak NOT_shows NOT_like NOT_the NOT_more NOT_recent NOT_"beloved" NOT_did .  i encourage anyone of any race to see this film .  9/10 
744 0 i saw this movie once a long time ago ,  and i have no NOT_desire NOT_to NOT_ever NOT_see NOT_it NOT_again . <br /><br />this movie is about preston waters ,  a hard-lucked preteen ,  who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash .  all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston's bike and passes him a blank check as compensation .  preston uses the check to withdraw $1 million from the bank (ironically ,  the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check) .  preston then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr .  macintosh (named after his computer) .  after that ,  he just goes crazy with the money . <br /><br />on paper ,  this sounds like a great idea .  however ,  on screen ,  it is one of the emptiest movies i've ever seen .  for one thing ,  it's too unbelievable .  i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible ,  but i draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman ,  and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune .  also ,  this was a shallow movie with weak acting ,  a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable .  the characters were either cheesy ,  over the top ,  annoying ,  or underdeveloped .  but "juice" was a funny character . <br /><br />if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family ,  skip this one . 
745 1 steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't NOT_win NOT_by NOT_directing NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_epics NOT_(he NOT_was NOT_nominated NOT_for NOT_three NOT_of NOT_them: NOT_"close NOT_encounters NOT_of NOT_the NOT_third NOT_kind" ,  "raiders of the lost ark" ,  and "e . t . : the extra-terrestrial" .  so he decided to get very serious by directing "the color purple" ,  a period film with no NOT_special NOT_effects .  spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie .  but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't NOT_give NOT_spielberg NOT_any NOT_respect .  "the color purple" received 11 oscar nominations including best picture ,  but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't NOT_nominated NOT_for NOT_best NOT_director .  it got worse on oscar night when this film didn't NOT_win NOT_a NOT_single NOT_oscar .  it got completely shut out .  that wasn't NOT_right .  "the color purple" should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldberg's spectacular film debut as celie ,  a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband (frightfully placed by danny glover) ,  then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends .  oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia ,  one of those friends' of celie .  since i'm from chicago ,  i had already known winfrey from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide) .  like goldberg ,  what a film debut! margaret avery is terrific as shug avery ,  another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie's rotten husband .  all three actresses received well-deserved oscar nominations for their work here (goldberg for best actress; winfrey and avery for best supporting actress) .  set in the south during the first half of the 20th century ,  "the color purple" is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end .  it also made me laugh at times too .  why academy voters were so hard on not NOT_nominating NOT_spielberg NOT_for NOT_best NOT_director NOT_is NOT_a NOT_mystery NOT_that NOT_still NOT_puzzles NOT_me NOT_today .  but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for "schindler's list" and "saving private ryan" ,  making him one of the best movie directors of all-time .  but he should have gotten nominated for this movie .  the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like "e . t . " to a serious drama like "the color purple" was remarkable . <br /><br />**** (out of four)

747 1 this movie is such a moving ,  amazing piece of work .  i saw it at the theater when it came out ,  but i was only 13 & didn't NOT_really NOT_quite NOT_"get NOT_it" .  .  .  i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just blown away .  steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end .  i have read the book as well ,  but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life .  the casting ,  acting ,  music ,  costuming ,  scenery ,  everything ,  it just wonderful .  you laugh ,  you cry ,  you cheer .  .  .  it brings out every emotion imaginable .  it is one of his finest pieces of work & should not NOT_be NOT_missed! 
748 0 blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it's a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn't NOT_worth NOT_a NOT_dime .  quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid's birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family? so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans? he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he's about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what? their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike? so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he's juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid! so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid you're loaded and you're talking about opening an account? we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice's then he told his cheapy dad he's got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something fbi agent? afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up shea's 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn't pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesn't NOT_know NOT_it's NOT_his NOT_son NOT_he's NOT_talking NOT_to NOT_and NOT_talks NOT_about NOT_preston NOT_should NOT_be NOT_a NOT_real NOT_kid NOT_and NOT_has NOT_his NOT_whole NOT_childhood NOT_ahead NOT_of NOT_him NOT_and NOT_wants NOT_preston NOT_to NOT_go NOT_home NOT_early NOT_what?

749 1 rating "10/10" master piece<br /><br />some years ago ,  i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance .  well ,  mr spielberg ,  i guess nothing is perfect ,  but this movie - together with schindler's list - is your best .  even oprah acts well in this one !<br /><br />what got me most is the realism of the story and drama .  stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world . 
750 0 two years ago ,  on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie "sue" in the panorama program ,  with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part .  it's a film about loneliness and sex ,  and how the one thing is compensated by the other .  in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue ,  "extension du domaine de la lutte" ,  which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no NOT_sex NOT_is NOT_one NOT_and NOT_the NOT_same NOT_problem .  but unfortunately we can't NOT_sympathize NOT_with NOT_"our NOT_hero" NOT_(how NOT_he NOT_is NOT_called NOT_by NOT_the NOT_story-teller) ,  because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself .  own fault ,  i'm sorry .  i can't NOT_understand NOT_him .  not NOT_enough ,  the writer/director/actor want us admitting to him ,  that it's not NOT_his NOT_destroyed NOT_self-consciousness NOT_or NOT_the NOT_passivity NOT_of NOT_his NOT_personality ,  what brought him so far ,  but the rotten society and its image of sexuality .  yes ,  there are some deeper insights about gender relations ,  but we won't NOT_follow NOT_him NOT_so NOT_far .  .  .  and the point is ,  that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate ,  having no NOT_sex .  who didn't NOT_notice NOT_yet ,  it's a quite depressing film .  .  . <br /><br />in the beginning ,  there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation .  at the bed store the "hero" speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed .  perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs ,  you have to stay at home half a day .  .  .  this is a satire about a character ,  who doesn't NOT_know NOT_taking NOT_the NOT_life NOT_and NOT_heart NOT_in NOT_hands ,  doing something .  .  .  the movie doesn`t follow this path ,  but handles his characters with helplessness .  nobody believes ,  that "our hero" is able to instigate tisserand for a murder .  too dull ,  too kind ,  too - passive (not to mention tisserand's complex; he has an inhibition ,  but he couldn't be ,  of course ,  a murderer of women!) .  to finish: there are women and the world ,  it's not NOT_a NOT_device NOT_of NOT_a NOT_modern NOT_sexualized NOT_society .  help you as you can ,  but don't NOT_follow NOT_the NOT_messages NOT_and NOT_the NOT_"wisdom" NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie ,  which announces bankruptcy to human relationships ,  without seizing the real conflicts within . 
751 1 this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen .  i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it .  the acting and plot are amazing .  it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics .  i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama . 
752 0 the french film "extension du domaine de la lutte" directed by iconoclast film maker philippe harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer michel houellebecq . he has also worked on this film's scenario . according to british cinema magazine sight and sound , it is also known as "whatever" . this film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not NOT_so NOT_common NOT_theme NOT_of NOT_sexual NOT_politics NOT_and NOT_its NOT_implications NOT_on NOT_two NOT_stupid NOT_information NOT_technology NOT_workers . the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character . this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read .  the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend . instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall . beware:some women viewers might find not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_film NOT_but NOT_even NOT_its NOT_two NOT_heroes NOT_as NOT_moronic NOT_misogynists . 
753 1 spielberg's first dramatic film is no NOT_let-down .  it's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an african-american woman .  it also proves that not NOT_all NOT_movies NOT_that NOT_have NOT_the NOT_african-american NOT_ethnicity NOT_as NOT_the NOT_center NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_helmed NOT_by NOT_an NOT_african-american NOT_director . <br /><br />what i love about this movie is spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book .  furthermore ,  danny glover was excellent as mr .  and usually ,  he's just himself throughout most of his movies .  but in this ,  he completely branches out and is someone else for once .  but ,  the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg .  she is excellent as celie .  you will never NOT_forget NOT_these NOT_characters NOT_once NOT_you've NOT_seen NOT_this NOT_movie . <br /><br />now ,  i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well ,  and all i can say is: i hope it's about as good as this one is ,  because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed .

755 1 genteel ,  softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre .  a departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare ,  it paved the way for his 1993 success ,  "schindler's list" . <br /><br />based upon alice walder's pulitzer prize winning novel ,  the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal ,  angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie .  while the plot - about compassion ,  abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving ,  it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes' scrambling screenplay .  "the color purple" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame .  this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walker's novel .  a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems ,  as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director . <br /><br />performances are strong throughout ,  with whoopi goldberg making a debut - which she's never NOT_matched NOT_since NOT_with NOT_regard NOT_to NOT_acting NOT_accomplishment NOT_- NOT_as NOT_the NOT_heart NOT_broken NOT_celie NOT_who NOT_just NOT_yearns NOT_to NOT_be NOT_loved .  danny glover lends solid support ,  though his "moses" was a superior turn for him in "places in the heart" .  the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia ,  the single minded ,  fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising ,  upper class white woman .  good support also from margaret avery ,  adolph caesar and rae dawn chong . <br /><br />quincy jones ( co-producer with spielberg ,  kathleen kennedy and frank marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion .  editing from michael kahn is sound as always ,  while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenery . <br /><br />this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye ,  it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions . <br /><br />wednesday ,  january 15 ,  1997 - video 
756 0  .  .  .  but the keyword here is "usually . " i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb .  but in the world of b-rated movies ,  this one is z-rated .  absolutely ridiculous .  the thing i respect about most of my favorite b-rated movies are that they don't NOT_take NOT_themselves NOT_too NOT_seriously .  the makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly ,  even if it's a heavy topic .  i get the impression ,  however ,  that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously ,  like they were putting together a 10-star classic ,  complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots .  nevertheless ,  despite all this ,  i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars ,  as i am biased towards movies like this .  if you're a b-rated fan ,  however ,  i would try too hard to find this one . 
757 1 these days spielberg's "the color purple" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch .  what's even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasn't NOT_even NOT_nominated NOT_for NOT_best NOT_director .  needless to say ,  the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded . <br /><br />the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson (whoopi goldberg) ,  an african-american woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband .  the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celie's relationships with the women around her .  it's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick' . <br /><br />the story is an interesting one ,  livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount .  some may not NOT_appreciate NOT_the NOT_change NOT_in NOT_tone NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_film's NOT_end NOT_but NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_mind NOT_even NOT_though NOT_similar NOT_content NOT_in NOT_a NOT_lesser NOT_film NOT_would NOT_likely NOT_have NOT_me NOT_rolling NOT_my NOT_eyes . <br /><br />the film received three oscar nominations for acting: whoopi goldberg (best actress) ,  oprah winfrey (best supporting actress) and margaret avery (best supporting actress) .  i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffed . <br /><br />as already mentioned ,  spielberg didn't NOT_receive NOT_a NOT_best NOT_director NOT_nomination NOT_for NOT_his NOT_efforts .  such an omission beggars belief ,  since spielberg's direction here is top-notch .  i'm not NOT_especially NOT_crazy NOT_about NOT_quincy NOT_jones's NOT_score NOT_but NOT_it's NOT_not NOT_below NOT_average NOT_by NOT_any NOT_means . <br /><br />in the end ,  the story is a satisfying one ,  well-told by a master film-maker working from pulitzer prize-winning material .  give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night . 
758 0 the tv guide calls this movie a mystery .  what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents .  this is bollywood at its best/worst ,  i honestly cannot tell the difference .  nauseatingly sweet ,  kitschy clichã©s on every level ,  story-line ,  situations ,  dialog ,  music and choreography .  to put it bluntly ,  you must be a retard to enjoy it .  i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity ,  but there were times when i had to walk away from it ,  because i could not NOT_take NOT_it NOT_any NOT_more .  the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses .  <br /><br /> 
759 1 1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members . <br /><br />11 nominations and not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_title: NOT_such NOT_was NOT_the NOT_academy's NOT_disdain NOT_for NOT_one NOT_of NOT_their NOT_greatest NOT_directors; NOT_and NOT_one NOT_who NOT_had NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_another NOT_8 NOT_years NOT_before NOT_whatever NOT_prejudices NOT_had NOT_prevented NOT_them NOT_from NOT_handing NOT_him NOT_the NOT_statue NOT_before NOT_allowed NOT_them NOT_to NOT_give NOT_him NOT_7 NOT_for NOT_schindler's NOT_list ,  which is ,  arguably ,  not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_(and NOT_i'm NOT_half-polish) . <br /><br />don't get me wrong ,  schindler was a classic .  and i'm not NOT_knocking NOT_'out NOT_of NOT_africa' NOT_(which NOT_won NOT_that NOT_year) NOT_either; NOT_but NOT_it NOT_was ,  in my mind ,  a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and i'm not NOT_a NOT_big NOT_cryer . <br /><br />maybe it was the music (superb) ,  or the cinematography (sumptuous) ,  but more likely simply the acting: whoopi ,  who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; danny glover ,  who i'd never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_before; NOT_and ,  of course ,  oprah . <br /><br />the rest is history; but ,  at the time: who knew? 
760 0 i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie .  its a big joke .  good .  .  its entertaining  .  .  you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film  .  .  i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to . <br /><br />priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salman/rani who want a child but can't .  i wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life . <br /><br />rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & salman .  she cares for priety and tries pushing her husband salman to preity so they may have some romance .  when will the audience get fed up of salman's nakhras . <br /><br />though a good past-time ,  this movie is unbearable .  absurd . 
761 1 taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s ,  steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walker's "the color purple" ,  about about the desperate existence of an african-american woman in the 1930s .  watching goldberg play celie ,  it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like "sister act" .  this is the sort of movie that could easily be - no ,  make that should be - part of the curriculum in black studies and women's studies .  there's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen (you'll know it when you see it) .  i can't NOT_believe NOT_that NOT_this NOT_didn't NOT_win NOT_a NOT_single NOT_oscar; NOT_it NOT_may NOT_be NOT_spielberg's NOT_second NOT_best NOT_movie NOT_behind NOT_"schindler's NOT_list" NOT_(maybe NOT_even NOT_tied NOT_with NOT_it) .  also starring danny glover ,  adolph caesar ,  margaret avery ,  oprah winfrey ,  willard e .  pugh ,  akosua busia ,  and laurence fishburne . 
762 0 this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power ,  sentimentality and love triangle of emotions .  what really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother .  a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not NOT_a NOT_surrogate NOT_mother .  neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother .  i have seen indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently .  the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible .  i realize that most bollywood movies aren't NOT_meant NOT_to NOT_be NOT_plausible ,  but they don't NOT_pretend NOT_to NOT_be NOT_either .  this movie wants us to emote along with the characters ,  but this can't NOT_done NOT_with NOT_such NOT_a NOT_ridiculous ,  contrived conflict .  i would have expected better from abbas and mustan . 
763 1 i gave this film 10 not NOT_because NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_superbly NOT_consistent NOT_movie ,  but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience .  the story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old clichã© by now ,  but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple . <br /><br />it also showed a different side to the african-american experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people .  i find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-oscar trend . <br /><br />also the acting performances are superb - especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for . <br /><br />well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy .

765 1 one of the finest films ever made! why it only got a 7 . 6 rating is a mystery .  this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america .  should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 .  i recommend watching it with "the long walk home" as a companion piece .  if you think whoopi goldberg's work is about "homer and eddie" or "hollywood squares , " think again .  don't NOT_miss NOT_this NOT_movie ,  which should have won the oscar .  (and read the book ,  too!) 
766 0 the plot line of no NOT_one NOT_sleeps NOT_is NOT_not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_idea ,  and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest .  but ,  throughout watching this film ,  we were saying aloud ,  "these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations ,  the lighting is good ,  makeup and hair are good .  .  . why is the sound so bad?" throughout the film the sound was echoy ,  garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible . <br /><br />there is some good acting in this film ,  and i think jim thalman is really a good actor .  this story ,  with some of the same actors ,  would have been worth doing as a high-budget film . <br /><br />i just can't NOT_reiterate NOT_enough NOT_- NOT_if NOT_you NOT_have NOT_a NOT_limited NOT_budget ,  dedicate more to good sound .  sound is as much a part of a film as the image ,  and it's worth doing right .  could've earned a 6 . 
767 1 this film captured my heart from the very beginning ,  when hearing quincy jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows .  this is truly a film to cry and die for .  .  . ! the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i've seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself! whoppi goldberg ,  margaret avery ,  oprah winfrey(oh lord!) ,  danny glover ,  and the others ,  all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! goldberg is celie ,  she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character ,  and we grow with her ,  we grow strong together with her ,  throughout the movie ,  and we triumph with her .  margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery ,  even when she's at her most arrogant ,  and shows us that "sinners" ,  indeed ,  "have souls too" .  the always sympathetic ,  charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(i'd say sir)quincy jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film! the photography ,  the music ,  the director and the music makes this beautiful ,  soulful movie into an experience of life .  you don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_miss NOT_it!

769 1 the film version of alice walker's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel (written largely as letters from the central character celie to god) was a massive oscar success ,  and rightly so . <br /><br />in the role of the abused and awakened celie ,  whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles .  not NOT_far NOT_behind NOT_her NOT_was NOT_oprah NOT_winfrey NOT_as NOT_sofia ,  the fiery woman tamed by fate .  others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page - danny glover as albert ,  celie's abusive husband; margaret avery as shug ,  a force of change for the good; willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak; susan beaubian as corrine ,  the preacher's wife; and the much-missed carl anderson (otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar) as preacher samuel . <br /><br />beautifully paced and sensitively written ,  'the color purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama . 
770 0 poorly written conspiracy drama/mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government .  wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers--that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find .  despite the cinematography itself being commendable ,  the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow ,  amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey .  grade: d+ 
771 1 a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker .  the fact is ,  steven spielberg ,  probably our greatest story-teller ,  has been doing this in various movie formats for years .  the color purple ,  at the time ,  was considered risky ,  especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark .  in hindsight ,  this film should have come as no NOT_surprise ,  for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in e . t .  critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare .  it is quite an entrance .  no NOT_special NOT_effects ,  no NOT_swashbuckling ,  just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by alice walker .  one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about african-americans in the deep south .  slavery is gone ,  but in the south depicted here ,  it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves .  <br /><br />spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience .  this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations .  it is the first in a line of films people either didn't NOT_see NOT_or NOT_wouldn't NOT_see NOT_because NOT_there NOT_are NOT_no NOT_aliens .  empire of the sun ,  always ,  schindler's list ,  etc .  .  his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a) he uses mostly untrained ,  first-time actors ,  b) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen ,  and c) it is pure drama with no NOT_strings NOT_pulled NOT_where NOT_characters NOT_grow NOT_and NOT_change NOT_over NOT_the NOT_passage NOT_of NOT_roughly NOT_30 NOT_years .  it is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not NOT_garner NOT_a NOT_single NOT_academy NOT_award NOT_from NOT_11 NOT_nominations NOT_is NOT_a NOT_travesty NOT_and NOT_an NOT_insult . <br /><br />whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie ,  an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover ,  who she only knows as "mister" .  the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with "mister" .  the pg-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel .  this is not NOT_"the NOT_burning NOT_bed" NOT_in NOT_georgia NOT_by NOT_any NOT_means .  there is no NOT_blatant NOT_revenge NOT_taken NOT_as NOT_might NOT_be NOT_expected .  it happens gracefully .  goldberg perfectly plays a human being ,  someone in need of love and someone who deserves it .  the films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister ,  nettie (played by akosua busia) are separated ,  maybe forever .  (possibly foreshadowing holocaust separation of child and parent?) you may have to check for a pulse if you are not NOT_moved NOT_by NOT_this NOT_sequence . <br /><br />the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people .  there really is something to live for ,  but love triumphs over all .  spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens . <br /><br />rating: 10 of 10 
772 0 jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease .  were it not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_poignancy NOT_of NOT_the NOT_concept NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film ,  this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism . <br /><br />stefan (tom wlaschiha) journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused .  he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory ,  but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation .  simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place ,  each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini's opera 'turandot' which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera .  a police investigator louise tolliver (irit levi) and her companion cop (kalene parker) follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory .  he encounters a strange lad jeffrey (jim thalman) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs (richard conti) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects .  how this all come to an end is the play of the film ,  a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders . <br /><br />while tom wlaschiha ,  jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles (they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film!) ,  the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker: when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero .  there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit ,  but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of 'nessun dorma' as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film! good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors ,  but there is no NOT_resolution NOT_of NOT_the NOT_initial NOT_premise NOT_that NOT_started NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing .  grady harp ,  february 06 
773 1 tsui hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie .  unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung (i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this ,  it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times . <br /><br />this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department .  when i first saw this ,  my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i've never NOT_seen NOT_anything NOT_remotely NOT_like NOT_it NOT_but NOT_this NOT_is NOT_how NOT_it NOT_should NOT_be NOT_done NOT_in NOT_order NOT_to NOT_do NOT_full NOT_justice NOT_to NOT_the NOT_mythical NOT_world NOT_of NOT_chinese NOT_historical NOT_kung-fu NOT_novels! NOT_without NOT_a NOT_doubt NOT_this NOT_is NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_best-looking NOT_chinese NOT_historical NOT_kung-fu NOT_epic NOT_ever NOT_made . <br /><br />but alas ,  tsui hark hasn't improved much in the writing department ,  and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn't NOT_help NOT_either) .  to make it worse ,  this movie is very badly cast .  they decided to use the "hot" popular hong kong idols as lead characters ,  but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody .  adam cheng siu-chow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better . <br /><br />i wish that someday zhang yi-mou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of zhang .  .  .

779 1 yeah right .  sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983's "zu warrios from the magic mountain" .  now ,  2001 ,  he does it again with "zu warriors" .  but this time ,  he finally does it right .  you seldom see him in wuxia ,  more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick .  but this role simply does fit him! the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not NOT_often NOT_represented NOT_in NOT_movies NOT_(as NOT_far NOT_as NOT_i NOT_know NOT_about NOT_movies NOT_translated NOT_for NOT_the NOT_west) .  although ,  the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities .  straight said: you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie! and that makes it so great! and wow: all the colors plus the enormously deep ,  right-into-the-heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant .  the first time i watched it ,  i had to watch it again instantly ,  and i did .  ok true ,  i didn't NOT_understand NOT_all NOT_of NOT_it NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time .  but that makes it only better! you know ,  you didn't NOT_understand NOT_all NOT_of NOT_it ,  because there is so much spice in it! therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again .  and yeah ,  it grows deeper in your heart ,  the more often you watch it . <br /><br />summary: a story to love ,  characters you cry with ,  and truly: a movie you never NOT_forget!

780 0 i loved the apprentice for the first two seasons . <br /><br />but now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things are getting just plain too tiring . <br /><br />i used to like the show ,  but its become donald trumps own ego fest .  granted its his company you'll be working for ,  but come on! some of the things says "you're fired" is just insulting . <br /><br />after watching the show ,  i would not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_work NOT_for NOT_him .  not NOT_because NOT_he NOT_is NOT_arrogant ,  pompous or such .  its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm .  good entertainment? yes ,  but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring .  .  its not NOT_team NOT_work ,  its not NOT_personal ,  its just business .  watch your back jack . 
781 1 the first thing i thought when i saw this films was: it is not NOT_really NOT_a NOT_film ,  at least it is not NOT_what NOT_we NOT_imagine NOT_spontaneously NOT_when NOT_we NOT_hear NOT_the NOT_word NOT_"film" .  it is entirely symbolic ,  everything in it has a figurative meaning .  so if you are not NOT_used NOT_to NOT_express NOT_thing NOT_in NOT_a NOT_symbolic NOT_way ,  you will find it strange ,  if you are not NOT_acquainted NOT_with NOT_philosophy ,  religion ,  spiritual life ,  you will think it's just a fairy-tale .  .  .  and even a weird one ,  chaotic .  for me "the legend of zu" is perfectly transparent .  and i do like it .  it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness ,  the fight that is as old as humanity ,  and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it .  the film is obviously made by buddhists .  i am not NOT_a NOT_buddhist .  my religion and the vision of the world and human is different .  but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other .  it is a really beautiful film! and i which we had more films like this - films that have a meaning .  there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly . 
782 0 for the first couple of seasons ,  i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show .  the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job-interview was innovative ,  and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not NOT_too NOT_"out NOT_there" . <br /><br />the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all .  in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (that means lying ,  trash-talking ,  backstabbing etc . ) .  the boardroom can be entertaining to watch ,  but it's entertainment at it's low-point - sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode .  the tasks on the show are ,  at most ,  boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity .  and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life .  <br /><br />i have absolutely no NOT_respect NOT_for NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_contestants NOT_this NOT_season ,  they all seem like idiots to me .  in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity ,  now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show .  it also seems like donald trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest ,  i can't NOT_see NOT_why NOT_anyone NOT_with NOT_a NOT_common NOT_sense NOT_would NOT_want NOT_to NOT_work NOT_for NOT_him .  his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_sense NOT_at NOT_all NOT_and NOT_sometimes NOT_it NOT_seems NOT_he NOT_just NOT_like NOT_to NOT_trash NOT_people NOT_for NOT_what NOT_it's NOT_worth . <br /><br />r . i . p the apprentice .  please nbc ,  for god's sake ,  get the show off the air as soon as possible .  it's just too embarrassing to watch .  the apprentice was once a great tv-show ,  but now it's just a big fat joke . 
783 1 "zu:the warriors from magic mountain" was and is an impressive classic! you never NOT_would NOT_have NOT_guessed NOT_it NOT_was NOT_made NOT_in NOT_1983 .  tsui hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive .  (he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions . ) even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre .  "legend of zu" is connected to "zu"warriors from magic mountain"! it is not NOT_necessary NOT_to NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_of NOT_this NOT_one .  the plot is a bit hard to follow .  but to be honest it doesn't NOT_matter .  it is all about the action and adventure! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi .  now we know , he made this movie .  maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_critical NOT_about NOT_that .  there is so much happening on the screen , you simply won't NOT_believe! NOT_i NOT_think NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_big NOT_shame NOT_that NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_wasn't NOT_shown NOT_in NOT_theaters NOT_here NOT_in NOT_holland .  because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like "superman returns" or xmen 3 .  the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor! in most of tsui harks's movies he combines drama , fantasy , martial arts and humor .  somehow it is missing in this movie .  again i am not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_picky NOT_about NOT_these NOT_small NOT_matters .  "legend of zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see .  a true classic! 
784 0 besides being boring ,  the scenes were oppressive and dark .  the movie tried to portray some kind of moral ,  but fell flat with its message .  what were the redeeming qualities?? on top of that ,  i don't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_could NOT_make NOT_librarians NOT_look NOT_any NOT_more NOT_unglamorous NOT_than NOT_it NOT_did . 
785 1 the legend of zu ,  as i saw it ,  was a very interesting story .  i think many of the people who didn't NOT_like NOT_it NOT_were NOT_not NOT_seeing NOT_the NOT_underlying NOT_mythology NOT_behind NOT_the NOT_film .  they were expecting something akin to star wars ,  and it was not NOT_that .  joseph campbell ,  i believe ,  would have liked this film .  there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked .  we all have a mountain of swords within us .  we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives .  we all have to face our own insomnia someday .  granted some of the narration was a bit confusing ,  and some of the action got a little hokey at times ,  but i think other points of the film easily made up for it .  i'd watch it again .  <br /><br />i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_there's NOT_a NOT_difference NOT_between NOT_the NOT_legend NOT_of NOT_zu NOT_(which NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_in NOT_mandarin NOT_with NOT_english NOT_subtitles) NOT_and NOT_zu NOT_warriors NOT_(the NOT_dubbed NOT_usa NOT_version . ) it might have been dumbed down for american audiences ,  which really would have detracted from this film . 
786 0 for anyone craving a remake of 1989's slaves of new york .  what are there ,  seven of you? here it is .  .  .  was . <br /><br />this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (well they're club-kids ,  ya big jerk!) that are in holding patterns .  the big question seems to be ,  just how long can a young adult remain juvenile? it took three people to write this 'story'? good god ,  it was easier to come up with citizen kane .  rather than take viewers back ,  this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s . <br /><br />the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed ,  twenty-somethings could imagine it .  the odd sidebar about library work is not NOT_the NOT_sub-plot NOT_one NOT_expects NOT_from NOT_the NOT_equivalent NOT_of NOT_parker NOT_posey's NOT_breakin NOT_2: NOT_electric NOT_bugaloo .  her "i'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical .  posey's shtick is always amusing ,  but there are projects that are beneath her .  i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark . 
787 1 for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects ,  watch this movie! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen .  you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff . 
788 0 i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema .  so after watching the trailer for "water lilies , " i expected to like this film because i thought i'd stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of "beautiful thing . " <br /><br />the main characters are young french women 15 years old .  marie is slender ,  reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; floriane is outgoing ,  athletic and beautiful; and anne is loyal ,  pudgy and behaviorally immature .  the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie ,  if not NOT_at NOT_the NOT_surface ,  then just below it .  <br /><br />"water lilies , " however ,  is not NOT_about NOT_the NOT_dawning NOT_of NOT_lesbian NOT_love NOT_upon NOT_two NOT_teens; NOT_it NOT_is NOT_about NOT_sexual NOT_frustration ,  suffering ,  ennui ,  teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless ,  mechanical sex .  it also proves that screenwriters and film-makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative . <br /><br />in the extra features on the "lord of the flies" dvd ,  director peter brook says ,  "french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex , " meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism .  part of the downfall of this film is film-maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism . <br /><br />"where is the joy?" i asked myself while watching this film .  yes ,  first love can be painful and frustrating ,  but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh ,  life-affirming way .  these positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no NOT_balance . <br /><br />organically ,  this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love .  but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film .  first ,  what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema ,  as evidenced by films like "the slingshot; the rascals; the devil ,  probably; the little thief; murmur of the heart; friends; beau pere" and "europa ,  europa"; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - "see ,  audience ,  i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude . " either no NOT_nudity NOT_or NOT_evenly NOT_distributed NOT_nudity NOT_would've NOT_been NOT_an NOT_honest NOT_way NOT_to NOT_go . <br /><br />there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing .  what follows next is not NOT_just NOT_floriane NOT_cynically NOT_manipulating NOT_marie; NOT_it NOT_is NOT_film-maker NOT_sciamma NOT_cynically NOT_manipulating NOT_her NOT_audience . <br /><br />perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she's about to request something that is "not normal . " marie understandably asks ,  "who cares about being normal?" then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie ,  because floriane's request is a phony ,  derivative and substitute question - not NOT_the NOT_authentic ,  heartfelt question the movie ,  marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve .  <br /><br />here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves: 1) since when do the french - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits ,  and with a turtle to boot? 2) what teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?<br /><br />the three main actresses are promising and ,  if they find better vehicles for their talents ,  may become excellent actors .  louise blachere (anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles .  adele haenel (floriane) could become a leading lady ,  or a bombshell ,  or both .  pauline acquart (marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable .  in the future ,  she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim . <br /><br />all in all ,  "water lilies" was very disappointing .  will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! no NOT_- NOT_not NOT_necessarily NOT_for NOT_the NOT_sake NOT_of NOT_this NOT_middle-aged NOT_guy NOT_- NOT_but NOT_so NOT_young NOT_lesbian NOT_girls NOT_can NOT_have NOT_something NOT_of NOT_quality NOT_they NOT_can NOT_watch NOT_and NOT_identify NOT_with .  and yes ,  to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema . 
789 1 this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind ,  tsui hark .  it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow's shaolin soccer .  from the moment the movie started , there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were<br /><br />deplicted with superb style .  if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts "geek" ,  you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons .  there ,  comes a fine performance(as always) from ekin cheung who plays "sky king" .  he teams up with louis koo(red) who i was very impressed by his flexible "wing" which deflected incoming attacks .  the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way .  not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_the NOT_action NOT_superb NOT_but NOT_the NOT_has NOT_a NOT_somewhat NOT_complex NOT_storyline .  many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just "shoved in random bits of debrise" and even describe as "the legend of poo" .  however ,  the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie .  others who are famarialy with "wu xia" movies will have a better appoach .  in due respect .  there can be one weakness that could be foreseen .  the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made . in spite of all this ,  its a must see . 
790 0 when i ordered this from blockbuster's website i had no NOT_idea NOT_that NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be NOT_as NOT_terrible NOT_as NOT_it NOT_was .  who knows? maybe i'd forgotten to take my add meds that day .  i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon ,  donned in their late 70's-style wide collars ,  bell-bottoms and feathered hair ,  i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster . <br /><br />the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning ,  trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe ,  forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer .  from the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the "monsters" from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'the vagina monologues' . <br /><br />throughout the film ,  the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear .  the "ship" was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path .  of course if moved slower than bob barker's impacted bowels ,  but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two (with some assistance) . <br /><br />moving on .  .  .  as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue .  .  .  we found out that they're caught in a "space time warp" .  how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information? because the oldest male lead tells his son that ,  in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion ,  like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola .  was pops a scientist? nope ,  but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein's theories . <br /><br />the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality .  the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone ,  other than that ,  it was really ,  really ,  really bad .  (there's not NOT_enough NOT_'really's' NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_it ,  really) . <br /><br />i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics .  i never NOT_saw NOT_this NOT_film NOT_on NOT_its NOT_original NOT_release ,  but even back then i think i would've come to the same conclusion: bury this one quick . 
791 1 visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy ,  this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark ,  the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced .  the special effects are beautiful and imaginative .  the plot is a bit on the cerebral side ,  but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons .  if thinking is not NOT_your NOT_forte ,  however ,  this may not NOT_be NOT_your NOT_movie .  maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio's no NOT_brain NOT_club ,  but if you are looking for something more ,  he's where you will find it . 
792 0 i saw this when it was in the theater ,  it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time .  now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations ,  and other related psychological factors .  now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining .  it builds to an excellent climax then .  .  .  .  it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it ,  besides being a very poetic description .  in my experience ,  it was just not NOT_strong NOT_enough .  my wife and i were well .  .  .  how can i say this? we were upset ,  i mean we paid money ,  invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent .  "we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not NOT_raise NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_finish NOT_it NOT_correctly .  in fact my wife said it best ,  it did not NOT_end ,  it just stopped! 
793 1 legend of zu<br /><br />i remember well tsui hark's original zu warriors made 18 years earlier .  over one christmas ,  on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies ,  zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable ,  that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog .  .  . <br /><br />in fact ,  i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from .  and the memories of seeing yuen biao ,  sammo hung and others in their classic prime . <br /><br />so when i saw this remake of zu warriors ,  there was a feeling of apprehension .  could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original ,  or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies?<br /><br />well the answer is i can't NOT_say .  but that was because this isn't NOT_really NOT_a NOT_remake .  the stories (and styles) are almost completely different . <br /><br />the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky ,  a lone warrior ,  whose master ,  dawn ,  declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia .  two hundred years later ,  insomnia returns ,  dawn is reincarnated as enigma ,  and insomnia has returned to destroy zu .  meanwhile white eyebrows and red try ,  with the help of king sky ,  to stop insomnia . <br /><br />the plot isn't NOT_one NOT_full NOT_of NOT_twists NOT_and NOT_turns ,  but had enough detail in it to keep me interested .  but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate .  the film is very much about the special effects ,  with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments ,  much like the storm riders and a man called hero .  but unlike the other two ,  this film was one which didn't NOT_overdo NOT_the NOT_graphics NOT_and NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing NOT_was NOT_tasteful .  nothing appears rushed - unlike hero .  the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_overpowering NOT_the NOT_scenes . <br /><br />the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing .  it was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks' ,  but generally each character had its part in the story .  but some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion ,  and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this . <br /><br />ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film ,  but i couldn't say this film showed their best performances .  cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting ,  but it is still quite raw .  kelly lin was the new revelation for me .  despite her very short role ,  i have apologise and admit to ogling!<br /><br />overall ,  i have to say ,  did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original' .  given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark ,  the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades .  and one beauty of that is the fact that you can't NOT_really NOT_compare NOT_the NOT_two NOT_films NOT_at NOT_all ,  as much as apples are apples and pears are pears . <br /><br />ultimately ,  both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right .  and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again . <br /><br />two to watch ,  but not NOT_compare . 
794 0 okay ,  now what the hell is this supposed to be? is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg's "close encounters of the third kind"? or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as "when dinosaurs ruled the earth" and "the lost world"? perhaps it's an intellectual & philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend? yes ,  that must be it! whatever it is ,  the creators of "the day time ended" (good old john 'bud' cardos of "kingdom of the spiders" and writer david schmoeller of "tourist trap") must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres .  the story doesn't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_slightest NOT_bit NOT_of NOT_sense NOT_and NOT_the NOT_narrative NOT_structure NOT_is NOT_incoherent NOT_as NOT_hell NOT_but ,  hey ,  who cares as long as it's got papier-mã¢chã© dinosaurs ,  miniature spacecrafts ,  headache-inducing light & laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas! the voice-over introduction is practically inaudible ,  but no NOT_worries NOT_as NOT_it's NOT_all NOT_gibberish! NOT_did NOT_you NOT_know NOT_that NOT_the NOT_definition NOT_of NOT_'time' NOT_isn't NOT_what NOT_we NOT_all NOT_think NOT_it NOT_is? NOT_time NOT_doesn't NOT_necessarily NOT_pass NOT_by NOT_chronologically ,  it is one giant paradox! words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us .  i have absolutely no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_all NOT_this NOT_means ,  but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap-dancing midget aliens and well-mannered dinosaurs on screen together .  i deliberately say well-mannered dinosaurs ,  because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets .  the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar-powered house in the middle of nowhere .  grandpa is extremely annoying ,  the granddaughter even more ,  granny is a walking & talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery ,  the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is â… incredibly hot! chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy's husband on business travel .  the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable (i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about "excellent special effects" was being sarcastic) ,  but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs! just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing: <br /><br />grandpa: "you know what this is ,  don't NOT_you? NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_time-space NOT_warp!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>stevie: NOT_"i'm NOT_not NOT_quite NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_i NOT_know NOT_what NOT_that NOT_means ,  dad"<br /><br />grandpa: "well ,  i guess nobody really does" <br /><br />make up your mind ,  gramps! do you know what it is or don't NOT_you? NOT_and NOT_stop NOT_talking NOT_about NOT_"the NOT_vortex" NOT_like NOT_you're NOT_some NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_expert NOT_in NOT_the NOT_field! NOT_"the NOT_day NOT_time NOT_ended" NOT_is NOT_an NOT_incredibly NOT_childish NOT_and NOT_not-worth-bothering-for NOT_fantasy NOT_movie ,  though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects .  the ending completely comes out of nowhere ,  like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly . 
795 1 i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind ,  you can't NOT_top NOT_a NOT_person NOT_with NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_style NOT_of NOT_movie NOT_presence .  a chinese fantasy picture may not NOT_be NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_present NOT_to NOT_an NOT_audience ,  the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayed . <br /><br />the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 .  from this new millenium update ,  we could see tsui hark's vision of the zu mountains .  spectacular visual designs ,  amazing action-fantasy epic made beautifully well .  kept me glued through the entire picture .  great cast with just fine acting .  it's truly a fun movie to watch ,  but is it too weird?<br /><br />now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie .  plot may not NOT_have NOT_much NOT_relation NOT_among NOT_characters ,  but by rewatching the movie ,  you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself .  some can complain there isn't NOT_too NOT_much NOT_physical NOT_combat ,  besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes ,  spirits fighting by hand-to-hand wouldn't NOT_really NOT_make NOT_sense NOT_at NOT_all .  <br /><br />i appreciated this nice stylish picture .  it may have a thin story ,  but hey look at tsui hark's "time & tide , " we got confused by the plot as well ,  but it was truly something stylish and awesome .  tsui hark always attracts something different into h . k .  cinema .  american audiences ,  may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie ,  cause this ain't NOT_no NOT_crouching NOT_tiger ,  hidden dragon ,  this is a whole new genre .  although it may not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_masterpiece ,  but it's special effects is truly better than storm riders .  this is really worth checking out . 
796 0 c'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode .  it's just an old 60's tv show ! this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe (yeoman barrow's) ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location .  unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages . <br /><br />this use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show . <br /><br />except a few notable exceptions i . e "the city on the edge of forever"  ,  "assignment earth" and "tomorrow is yesterday" the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery .  half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average . <br /><br />this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually ,  contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on ,  he actually made a lot of rubbish! he doesn't NOT_deserve NOT_to NOT_be NOT_spoken NOT_of NOT_in NOT_the NOT_same NOT_breath NOT_as NOT_irwin NOT_allen NOT_for NOT_example . <br /><br />just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view .  they used wobbly plywood for the floor ,  cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels .  you can clearly see the folds in the paper ! every expense spared or what ! 
797 1 i'm stunt ,  i must admit i never NOT_saw NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_such NOT_good NOT_story NOT_and NOT_none NOT_stop NOT_high NOT_special NOT_effect NOT_martial NOT_art NOT_fighting NOT_scene .  if you like the fantastic genre ,  like me ,  you will certainly be more than satisfied! all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection ,  in one word ,  flawless! i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years . 
798 0 this picture started out with good intentions ,  bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility ,  and shue is cute as usual in her role .  it all falls apart after that ,  it's your typical hollywood thriller now ,  filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore ,  minus any kind of humour ,  wit or soul .  in other words ,  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_watching NOT_this .  get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead ,  also starring leonard nimoy .  now that was good ,  and hg wells is well served ,  unlike with this mess . 
799 1 this movie is very cool .  if you're a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films ,  you should love this .  this film is the asian lord of the rings: a high fantasy story ,  based in actual chinese mythology .  (i realize many critics have called this film plot-less ,  i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology . ) if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven & earth ,  this one should be right up your alley .  this film is still very difficult to find in the u . s .  ,  even though it was purchased for u . s .  distribution along with crouching tiger ,  hidden dragon and iron monkey .  well worth the search!!! this dvd is also worthy of owning . 
800 0 i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie .  it's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't NOT_suspend NOT_disbelief .  the problem starts early ,  when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle ,  overlooking the capitol building in washington ,  d . c .  that kind of life on a government salary? hah! it only gets worse .  toward the end ,  when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys ,  the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die ,  in order to cleanse the gene pool .  the special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films ,  but the screenplay and direction here are moronic .  many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven's previous ,  facially stupid movies (showgirls ,  starship troopers) ,  but this movie should stop the wondering .  he's just plain bad . 
801 1 when tsui hark experiments ,  nothing and no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_withstand NOT_him .  legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 .  one does not NOT_understand NOT_all ,  but like at "2001 a space odyssey" you also don't NOT_have NOT_to ,  but one feels the power of the film to every second ,  every picture .  an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering ,  astounding ,  rejoicing in the recent years .  vital severe masterpiece! it's absolutely perfect as it is . <br /><br />when tsui hark experiments ,  nothing and no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_withstand NOT_him .  legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 .  one does not NOT_understand NOT_all ,  but one feels the power of the film to every second ,  every picture .  an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering ,  astounding ,  rejoicing in the recent years .  vital severe masterpiece! it's absolutely perfect as it is .  10000000000000/10000000000000 
802 0 that's what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film .  first off ,  the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back .  the rest of the movie ,  though .  .  . <br /><br />none of the characters act in a realistic manner ,  especially in the aforementioned ,  despicable 3rd act (i promise i won't NOT_give NOT_it NOT_away ,  but trust me ,  it's not NOT_worth NOT_keeping NOT_a NOT_secret!) .  a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally ,  like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't NOT_work .  please ,  give the viewers more credit than that!!!<br /><br />some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting .  what would you do ,  after all ,  if you were invisible? no NOT_one NOT_could NOT_catch NOT_you!

803 1 i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu .  i thought it kicked a*s! it was so creative and unique .  it's the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama .  even if some thought there was too much special fx(yeah right!) ,  you can't NOT_complain NOT_about NOT_the NOT_cast .  zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine!!! the legend of zu .  .  .  .  . kicks a*s!!!!!!!! 
804 0 to describe this film as garbage is unfair .  at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby .  this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining . <br /><br />kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance ,  so no NOT_doubt NOT_had NOT_an NOT_irs NOT_bill NOT_to NOT_settle NOT_when NOT_he NOT_agreed NOT_to NOT_this NOT_dire NOT_screenplay .  the mad scientist story of 'hollow man' has been told before ,  been told better ,  and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects . <br /><br />most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men ,  women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies .  in the uk they were marketed as 'the transparent man (/woman/dog)' which is maybe where they got the title for this film . <br /><br />clever special effects ,  dire script ,  non-existent plot . <br /><br /> 
805 1 i have previously seen zu: warriors from the magic mountain .  in that film ,  the setting takes place in china's mountains ,  the legend of zu looks like another dimension!! thank that to tsui hark's extensive use of cgi effects .  he's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds ,  a land where beings fly freely ,  and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades ,  split swords ,  and the ultra cool moon orb . <br /><br />while there are many characters in this one ,  the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma .  the romance aspect is there ,  although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor .  cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching .  in the beginning ,  i like how she resembles the countess (from zu warriors) and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life .  oh ,  by the way ,  did i mention that cecilia's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />in truth ,  zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 .  tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema . 
806 0 another violent ,  angry fantasy from paul verhoeven .  verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously ,  with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion .  he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story ,  dialogue and performance .  kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy .  bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`the river wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material ,  however ,  bacon isn't NOT_nearly NOT_hateful NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_compel .  the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin ,  neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who ,  when forced to deliver inane dialogue ,  embarrass themselves .  the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended . 
807 1 i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero (my all time favourite) ,  storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too .  i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin cheng's acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far (way better than nicolas tse nevertheless)and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie .  without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end .  i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film .  they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that .  the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easily) . the story is not NOT_very NOT_intellectual NOT_and NOT_deep NOT_but NOT_that NOT_is NOT_not NOT_what NOT_you NOT_expect NOT_when NOT_watcing NOT_an NOT_action NOT_movie .  i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities ,  but well that's life and it never NOT_goes NOT_the NOT_way NOT_you NOT_want NOT_it NOT_to .  and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end ? that's way too funny .  legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_thing NOT_at NOT_all .  if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not NOT_get NOT_suprised NOT_as NOT_it NOT_carries NOT_all NOT_the NOT_videogames NOT_elements .  good work .  please make more fantasy movies like this 
808 0 shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role .  elizabeth shue is a commendable actress ,  why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? i must give credit where credit is due ,  though .  some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing ,  but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon's character ,  sebastian caine .  i wouldn't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_anyone ,  man or woman ,  that has any form of self-respect to account for . 
809 1 this is like "crouching tiger ,  hidden dragon" in a more surreal ,  fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame .  the plot may be hard to follow ,  but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience .  however ,  an intelligent person should be able to keep up; moreover ,  the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi . 
810 0 this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects .  there are some interesting visuals . <br /><br />aside from that ,  it's typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance .  true to the title . <br /><br />it's not NOT_worth NOT_picking NOT_apart NOT_the NOT_story .  that's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur .  there's not NOT_much NOT_there NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with .  it's nothing original and not NOT_very NOT_special .  so don't NOT_go NOT_in NOT_for NOT_the NOT_story NOT_at NOT_all .  just look at the effects . <br /><br />as has been mentioned ,  it got a little flashy at the end ,  diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man .  however if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics ,  it's a sight to behold (or not NOT_to NOT_behold) . <br /><br />all in all ,  it's a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone . 
811 1 i've been a fan of xu ke (hark tsui) for many year since school .  this film is the best fantasy movie in years .  i dont think "action" is the right genre ,  though there're lot of action and kongfu scenese .  wait ,  did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive? please ,  keep in mind that do not NOT_use NOT_hollywood NOT_formula NOT_to NOT_rate NOT_this NOT_film .  and for the guy who "poo" around ,  i don't NOT_blame NOT_you ,  'cause you still young and need to know more about "culture" . 
812 0 the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear .  sadly ,  they stopped there .  they should have continued to make the script disappear ,  then the silly set ,  and finally every visible element of this film .  because ,  there's nothing else there to show . <br /><br />gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film .  i don't NOT_really NOT_think NOT_they NOT_exist .  i think they bought this script at "scripts-r-us" ,  where you buy a standard blank "monster movie" script and just fill in the blanks .  there's a monster stalking us .  let's split up .  (they actually "let's split up" in this movie) .  hit alien/giant-bug/monster/invisible-man with crowbar .  not NOT_dead NOT_yet .  burn huge-rabbit/shark/invisible-man in unsurvivable fire .  not NOT_dead NOT_yet .  you know ,  the standard stuff .  even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (ir glasses ,  spraying with something like paint) were handled badly .  <br /><br />what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie .  they psychological issues for the subject ,  the deterioration of the mind due to the process ,  treating an invisible subject ,  and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting .  had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end ,  it would have been a much better movie .  all in all ,  it stunk . <br /><br />i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie ,  but i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_do NOT_any NOT_spoilers .  suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't NOT_think NOT_about NOT_pulling NOT_the NOT_plug NOT_on NOT_a NOT_machine NOT_rather NOT_than .  .  . 
813 1 this is one amazing movie!!!!! you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical .  there are always stories behind stories .  i myself did not NOT_understand NOT_everything NOT_but NOT_knowing NOT_chinese NOT_folklore NOT_(i NOT_studied NOT_them NOT_in NOT_school)it NOT_is NOT_very NOT_complicated .  you just have to take what it gives you .  .  .  .  . enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride .  .  .  . hooray!!!! 
814 0 i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real .  the special effects of this movie are very good .  i have seen most of this movie ,  since it's been airing on hbo for the past couple of months .  i must admit ,  i may have missed a few scenes ,  but i'm usually drawn into movies ,  and have seen some scenes more than once .  but every time i see some of "hollow man , " i feel depressed ,  almost like a "film noir . " i'm not NOT_sure NOT_why; NOT_perhaps NOT_it's NOT_that NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_want NOT_kevin NOT_bacon NOT_to NOT_be NOT_evil ,  and there's disappointment in that .  but i think it's witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes .  regardless ,  i can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly) ,  but i do not NOT_recommend NOT_for NOT_youngsters NOT_under NOT_the NOT_age NOT_of NOT_14 NOT_(perhaps NOT_12 ,  if they are mature) . 
815 1 o my gosh .  .  .  just give me a minute to breath .  this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't NOT_let NOT_you NOT_go NOT_until NOT_the NOT_very NOT_last NOT_blow NOT_in NOT_your NOT_face NOT_ending .  this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such .  legend of zu was beautifully created ,  although i didn't NOT_like NOT_a NOT_few NOT_things ,  they used alot of stand ins .  i wanted to see the real person fight but ,  oh well .  .  .  a few small let downs , and i didn't NOT_really NOT_like NOT_it NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_until NOT_i NOT_watched NOT_it NOT_again ,  when you understand it more it totally kicks a**! i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie ,  to see this movie .  i give this movie one of my highest ratings . go and see it when it comes out in america!!! 
816 0 other than some neat special effects ,  this movie has nothing to offer .  they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting ,  but with no NOT_success .  kevin bacon's acting was pretty good ,  but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot . 
817 1 i can't NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_all NOT_how NOT_much NOT_i NOT_love NOT_this NOT_movie .  i have read reviews that say that this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete" .  i say that these reviewers have no NOT_imagination! NOT_for NOT_anyone NOT_who NOT_loves NOT_fantasy NOT_fiction ,  this movie is for you .  if you ever loved playing dungeons & dragons .  .  .  this movie is for you ,  (especially if you got into the oriental adventures) i'm just sorry that i did not NOT_get NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_on NOT_the NOT_big NOT_screen .  (just more incentive to get my own big screen t . v .  :-) 
818 0 <br /><br />paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one .  he became a joke on himself .  once again we have a film which includes sex and violence ,  immorality ,  leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans . <br /><br />its all for nothing .  because their is no NOT_action NOT_at NOT_all NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  it fudges all its set pieces .  all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film .  in other words rampant over acting on almost every level .  starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited .  in this scientists are acting the same way .  sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not NOT_really NOT_made NOT_of NOT_the NOT_same NOT_mindset . <br /><br />one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens (elizabeth shue excepted) walk and talk .  why not NOT_show NOT_the NOT_extent NOT_of NOT_what NOT_the NOT_character NOT_could NOT_do NOT_in NOT_the NOT_outside NOT_world .  how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all??? think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept ,  both in terms of story and characterisation .  then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was . <br /><br />more insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius .  well one out of two isnt that bad . <br /><br />this film has nothing of note in it .  just like the title says . <br /><br />hollow!!! 
819 1 legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years .  it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art .  with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions ,  legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty .  this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life .  the acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you'd keep more to yourself . <br /><br />unlike the comments of many ,  the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency .  anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not NOT_be NOT_paying NOT_attention NOT_since NOT_or NOT_are NOT_used NOT_to NOT_such NOT_levels NOT_of NOT_sophistication NOT_as NOT_the NOT_titanic .  the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air .  legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur .  allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie . 
820 0 unfortunately ,  one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering ,  silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate ,  clichã©d screenplay .  hollow man is a rather useless film . <br /><br />practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters ,  the idea and the action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects .  however ,  it is just the same special effect done over and over again ,  and by the end of the film that has been done to death also .  i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme ,  which is hardly original in itself ,  would be the basis of something newer and more interesting .  this is not NOT_so .  it isn't NOT_long NOT_before NOT_the NOT_film NOT_turns NOT_into NOT_an NOT_overly-familiar NOT_blood NOT_bath NOT_and NOT_mass NOT_of NOT_ineffectual NOT_histrionics NOT_- NOT_the NOT_mound NOT_of NOT_clichã©s NOT_piles NOT_up NOT_so NOT_fast NOT_that NOT_it's NOT_almost NOT_impressive . <br /><br />on top of all this ,  kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best .  good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score (but no NOT_competition NOT_for NOT_his NOT_better NOT_efforts) ,  a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects .  i was tempted to give this film three out of ten ,  but the effects push hollow man's merit up one notch . <br /><br />4/10 
821 1 i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it ,  part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night .  after several awful american action adventure films (ballistic ,  daredevil ,  cradle of life) zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking .  the story is complete nonsense ,  but i found the film's sincerity ,  good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing ,  and the film looks spectacular .  sure ,  the special effects are not NOT_technically NOT_as NOT_flawless NOT_as NOT_those NOT_produced NOT_by NOT_hollywood ,  but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color ,  composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking .  in one shot ,  two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock ,  a huge moon rising before them ,  the image perfectly balanced by the three elements .  in another ,  a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile .  and the colors explode from shot to shot ,  used to express emotion rather than to represent reality . <br /><br />the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters ,  offering no NOT_great NOT_depth NOT_in NOT_themselves NOT_but NOT_referring NOT_to NOT_archtypes NOT_that NOT_resonate NOT_more NOT_deeply .  physically ,  several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful .  they play their roles straight up ,  without irony or guile ,  and so are believable . <br /><br />most strange of all ,  despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations ,  i found myself very near tears at the end ,  moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original ,  good-hearted vision of the director . <br /><br /> 
822 0 i don't NOT_normally NOT_feel NOT_much NOT_of NOT_an NOT_incentive NOT_to NOT_comment NOT_on NOT_films NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_like ,  but in a case like this one ,  i just have to say something .  this movie is terrible ,  illogical ,  and stupid .  there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don't NOT_even NOT_feel NOT_obliged NOT_to NOT_elaborate NOT_on NOT_because NOT_it's NOT_time NOT_for NOT_me NOT_to NOT_move NOT_on NOT_from NOT_this NOT_experience .  the most annoying point is ,  however ,  that at no NOT_point NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_does NOT_anyone NOT_explain NOT_whether NOT_the NOT_motivations NOT_for NOT_bacon's NOT_character's NOT_madness NOT_are NOT_due NOT_to NOT_a NOT_power NOT_trip NOT_or NOT_a NOT_physiological NOT_reaction NOT_to NOT_his NOT_condition . <br /><br />granted the special effects are impressive ,  and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff (the director's cut of robocop on dvd is great) .  however ,  this movie is stupid and generally doesn't NOT_come NOT_near NOT_to NOT_explaining NOT_the NOT_point NOT_or NOT_technical NOT_aspect NOT_of NOT_the NOT_subject NOT_matter ,  and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment . <br /><br /> in short ,  as many other reviews here say (wish i had read them before .  .  . ) - stay away from this film! 
823 1 this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is (5 . 9/10(576 votes) as of this writing) .  this movie has incredible special effects ,  a true epic storyline ,  complex great character interaction ,  and mind-blowing battles - they have to be seen to be believed! the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got (some lines were not NOT_translated NOT_- NOT_???) . <br /><br />i just don't NOT_understand NOT_when NOT_i NOT_read NOT_& NOT_hear NOT_from NOT_various NOT_sources: NOT_"it NOT_has NOT_a NOT_confusing NOT_plot .  .  .  . " ,  "i couldn't follow the story .  .  .  . " or "characters came from nowhere .  .  . " .  from the very 1st time i watched this movie ,  i understood it ,  followed it ,  knew why characters were there ,  and i absolutely loved it! i've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment .  oh ,  and this is not NOT_just NOT_my NOT_opinion ,  because i've shown this movie to many fellow americans (people who have never NOT_seen NOT_an NOT_hk NOT_film NOT_before) NOT_who NOT_feel NOT_the NOT_same NOT_way .  not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them NOT_failed NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_the NOT_storyline NOT_and NOT_each NOT_person NOT_declared NOT_their NOT_love NOT_for NOT_this NOT_movie .  oh man ,  why can't NOT_we NOT_have NOT_stuff NOT_like NOT_this NOT_coming NOT_out NOT_of NOT_hollywood?

824 0 within the realm of science fiction ,  two particular themes consistently elicit interest ,  were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era ,  and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike ,  with varying degrees of success .  the first theme ,  that of time travel ,  has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film ,  as well as the written word ,  most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h . g .  wells classic ,  `the time machine . ' the second theme ,  which also manages to hold audiences in thrall ,  is that of invisibility ,  which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities .  and this theme ,  too ,  has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h . g .  wells classic ,  `the invisible man , ' the realization of which ,  here ,  is `hollow man , ' directed by paul verhoeven ,  and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue . <br /><br />sebastian caine (bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u . s .  government ,  exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility ,  which they have ,  at last ,  achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method .  they have ,  in fact ,  progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original `visual' state of being .  it's a problem ,  however ,  that caine ,  after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab ,  has solved-- or so he thinks .  and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful ,  he decides to present the results to the board of directors ,  in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project . <br /><br />at the last minute ,  though ,  caine demurs ,  fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject .  and he takes it upon himself to become that subject ,  securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so .  but something goes wrong ,  and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late ,  it all begins to take a toll on caine's mind .  and suddenly ,  his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential ,  as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that .  now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- including himself . <br /><br />verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting ,  even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the f/x at his disposal to great effect ,  though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development .  anyone familiar with `the invisible man , ' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story ,  will know early on that caine is not NOT_destined NOT_for NOT_happier NOT_times .  still ,  verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience .  but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax ,  and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful ,  opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film .  rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine's suffering ,  and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion ,  verhoeven takes the low road ,  and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level ,  any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind ,  along with anything that would have made this a memorable film .  and it's a shame ,  because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre ,  and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower . <br /><br />kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable ,  if only on the surface ,  which seemingly serves verhoeven's purposes perfectly .  there's little depth to bacon's portrayal ,  but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities .  verhoeven simply does not NOT_allow NOT_bacon NOT_the NOT_time NOT_to NOT_develop NOT_caine NOT_to NOT_any NOT_extent; NOT_the NOT_character NOT_is NOT_mainly NOT_a NOT_vessel NOT_around NOT_which NOT_verhoeven NOT_can NOT_build NOT_his NOT_story ,  and toward that end ,  it works .  the film would have been better served ,  however ,  had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part ,  something that would have drawn them in a bit ,  rather than leaving them at the gate ,  as it were ,  as mere observers of an f/x laden extravaganza . <br /><br />elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay ,  caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment ,  but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge ,  especially to an actor of shue's caliber .  the same can be said of kim dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film ,  `things behind the sun') .  her character ,  sarah kennedy ,  does little more than support the action and f/x .  both actors are capable of so much more ,  and deserve better than what they are given to work with here . <br /><br />the supporting cast includes josh brolin (matthew) ,  greg grunberg (carter) ,  joey slotnick (frank) ,  mary randle (janice) and william devane (dr .  kramer) .  entertaining to a point ,  and even successful on a certain (low) level ,  `hollow man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been .  like an annual fireworks display ,  it will give you some momentary thrills ,  but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen ,  without anything special to set it apart .  and it's too bad ,  because given the talent and abilities of those involved here ,  it could have been so much more .  i rate this one 4/10 . <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> 
825 1 i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole .  susan sarandon is such a good actor ,  that she made an interesting ,  strong character out of mediocre writing .  the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome . 
826 0 this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression .  .  story writing is what movie making is about .  <br /><br />incredible visual effects .  .  very good acting ,  especially from shue .  everything is perfect .  .  except .  .  the story is just poor and so ,  everything fails . <br /><br />picture this ,  if you had the power to be invisible .  .  what would you do? well ,  our mad scientist here (played by kevin bacon) could think of no NOT_other NOT_thing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_but NOT_fondle NOT_and NOT_rape NOT_women .  .  this is all his supposedly "genius" mind could think of .  does he try to gain extra power? no .  he doesn't NOT_even NOT_bother NOT_research NOT_a NOT_way NOT_to NOT_get NOT_back NOT_to NOT_being NOT_visible .  the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac . <br /><br />add to that ,  the lab atmosphere ,  you have all these young guys .  .  throwing around jokes like they were in a bar .  .  if it wasn't NOT_for NOT_all NOT_the NOT_white NOT_coats NOT_and NOT_equipment ,  you would think this is a bad imitation of "cheers . " very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man's wolf . <br /><br />even as a thriller ,  the movie falls way short because most of the "thrilling" scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming "this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me . "<br /><br />if you read the actual book ,  while the scientist (cane) goes after women ,  there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character .  in the movie ,  cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it .  just sad . 
827 1 sure this movie is not NOT_historically NOT_accurate NOT_but NOT_it NOT_is NOT_great NOT_entertainment .  most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip .  the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments .  the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives .  this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured .  later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne .  the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish .  jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here . 
828 0 going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac .  so right away you're guessing who will live and who will die .  the survivors end up being exactly who you'd expect them to be ,  so no NOT_points NOT_for NOT_plot NOT_twists NOT_there . <br /><br />and if you're not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_b-movie NOT_or NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_just NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_take NOT_place NOT_in NOT_a NOT_lab NOT_with NOT_an NOT_engaging NOT_story ,  william devane plays a part: instant b-movie status . <br /><br />the movie is promising in the beginning .  at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent .  oooh ,  foreboding .  the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again .  great special effects .  same thing when they make bacon invisible . <br /><br />there are a couple of bare breasts ,  a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an r-rating that it really didn't NOT_need . <br /><br />for a thriller there weren't NOT_really NOT_any NOT_surprises ,  except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer ,  which is more of a 'whaaaa?' ok ,  there is one surprise .  that's when caine (bacon) comes back one last time in the elevator shaft .  it was a surprise but only because you're yelling at tv ,  'noooo! you're dead already! end the movie!' speaking of yelling at the tv , that's all i did for the last 25 minutes or so .  'put on your f#@%ing goggles!' instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him ,  they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers ,  sprinkler systems .  .  . ) . <br /><br />the story really lost it at the end .  but the special effects were good; that's the only reason i give it a 2/10 . 
829 1 cecil b .  demille really knew how to create a classic ,  and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy ,  engrossing ,  entertaining ,  spectacular; in no NOT_way NOT_outdated . <br /><br />as a real fan of tv's deadwood ,  i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more on-target . <br /><br />we don't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_giants NOT_in NOT_hollywood NOT_anymore .  plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade: released ,  re-issued ,  re-issued all over again .  filmmakers like today's spielberg ,  jackson ,  bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox .  none of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years . 
830 0 leave it to paul "sex on the brain" verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story .  if he'd direct a pokemon film ,  i'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts .  i don't NOT_mind NOT_sex NOT_or NOT_even NOT_sleaze NOT_(check NOT_my NOT_other NOT_reviews) NOT_on NOT_film NOT_but NOT_frankly ,  it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it .  it's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't NOT_spend NOT_so NOT_much NOT_time NOT_having NOT_an NOT_invisible NOT_kevin NOT_bacon NOT_grope NOT_women .  <br /><br />the game cast of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them ,  including william devane ,  who is totally wasted here . <br /><br />but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls ,  which ,  btw ,  is much more entertaining than this stilted & bad film . 
831 1 the master of movie spectacle cecil b .  de mille goes west .  using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never NOT_met) , gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickock , james ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane .  the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on ,  like the big indian attack . scenes like that are extremely well done . if you don't NOT_mind NOT_the NOT_somewhat NOT_over-the-top NOT_performances NOT_of NOT_the NOT_cast NOT_this NOT_is NOT_an NOT_very NOT_entertaining NOT_western . look out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big horn . this part got him at least noticed in hollywood . 
832 0 (some spoilers) - as if you wouldn't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_it'll NOT_end<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>my NOT_expectations NOT_for NOT_hollow NOT_man NOT_were NOT_high .  a very good commercial ,  a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue ,  plus a very interesting theme - invisibility .  every premise for a great movie was accomplished .  unfortunately these things didn't NOT_matter NOT_at NOT_all .  the movie was very very week ,  without suspense and awfully predictable .  <br /><br />it's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility .  after the tests on animals succeeded ,  kevin bacon decides to test it on himself .  once he's invisible ,  he changes completely ,  realizing the advantages of not NOT_being NOT_seen .  from this to murder there's a very thin line . <br /><br />hollow man is an ill movie .  it suffers of the disease that many new movies have: the special effects .  from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller ,  verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects ,  without giving a damn about the real value of the movie .  i must admit ,  the fx are awesome ,  probably the best i have seen since matrix ,  but that's not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_good .  actually that's the problem with the movies today .  just like verhoeven ,  most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more .  the exceptions are very few ,  and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot . <br /><br />after starship troopers ,  verhoeven disappoints again .  in stead of a great film ,  hm is cr*p .  there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1 .  the special effects 2 .  the joke with superman and wonder woman (i won't NOT_spoil NOT_this NOT_moment NOT_for NOT_you .  .  . )<br /><br />okay ,  so what went wrong with the movie? everything .  let's see what i can remember . <br /><br />--- it's not NOT_tensed NOT_at NOT_all .  it should've been ,  but it's not . <br /><br />--- it's too predictable  .  you know from the beginning who will die and who will live . <br /><br />--- in stead of focusing on the psychological part ,  verhoeven cares only about the effects . <br /><br />--- very many cliches .  <br /><br />--- of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying . <br /><br />--- just like in every low quality horror ,  the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible .  every time there is somebody alone in the lab ,  perfect victim for bacon . <br /><br />--- some holes in the plot .  example: at the beginning ,  bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab .  after he's invisible ,  how can he do that?<br /><br />--- the ending: absolutely horrible . <br /><br />--- after shue hits bacon in the head ,  bacon falls down to the ground .  then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly ,  without looking back .  is that normal? then bacon gets up ,  attacks them ,  they "kill" him again .  and then shue screams "i heard an explosion" (happened minutes ago) ,  and they suddenly run inside .  didn't NOT_she NOT_hear NOT_that NOT_explosion NOT_some NOT_time NOT_before?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>--- NOT_there's NOT_a NOT_scene NOT_in NOT_which NOT_you NOT_can NOT_see NOT_the NOT_microphones NOT_hanging NOT_above NOT_the NOT_actors .  come on ,  mr verhoeven  ,  i expected much more from you!<br /><br />so that's about hollow man .  what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam .  <br /><br />vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects) 
833 1 the plainsman is an entertaining western ,  no NOT_doubt NOT_a NOT_classic ,  which is actual even today .  gary cooper is wild bill hickok ,  ideal for the role ,  together with john wayne and james stewart ,  they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation .  jean arthur is great as calamity jane ,  nobody that i know played it better than her .  even if might not NOT_be NOT_historically NOT_accurate ,  the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place .  sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here .  the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill ,  the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war ,  custer and little big horn ,  the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill's wife ,  a religious woman ,  with hickok a man who had killed plenty ,  also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film .  anthony quinn has a very short appearance ,  that already shows what a great actor he was going to become .  a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time . 
834 0 i get to the cinema every week or so ,  and regularly check out this site ,  but never NOT_before NOT_have NOT_i NOT_felt NOT_compelled NOT_to NOT_comment NOT_on NOT_a NOT_film . <br /><br />to my all time list of shockingly bad films - last man standing ,  spawn ,  the bone collector - i can now add the drivel that was 'hollow man' . <br /><br />from the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal ,  and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end . <br /><br />this isn't NOT_just NOT_my NOT_opinion NOT_- NOT_it NOT_was NOT_that NOT_of NOT_my NOT_friends ,  and everyone around us .  when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller ,  its clear that the film is hopeless . <br /><br />not only that ,  it was sick too .  the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film ,  and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked b-movie .  it's difficult not NOT_to NOT_imagine NOT_the NOT_director NOT_as NOT_some NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_dirty NOT_old NOT_man ,  because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts .  perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible ,  but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved ,  it hardly makes entertaining cinema . <br /><br />[spoilers follow]<br /><br />get past the films sick exterior ,  and things are even worse .  whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man' ,  the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast .  one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man ,  "he's finally snapped" shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion .  this is par for the course ,  and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting .  they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified ,  guns poised ,  but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague .  the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her ,  and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts ,  even after he drowns the pentagon chief ,  "he drowned in his pool last night" reports the same female ,  spectacularly failing to put two and two together . <br /><br />the script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue ,  and the rest is just an a-z of film cliches ,  which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end . <br /><br />the 'eureka' moment at the computer ,  the female undressing at the window ,  the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers ,  the decision not NOT_to NOT_kill NOT_the NOT_two NOT_main NOT_stars NOT_but NOT_just NOT_put NOT_them NOT_in NOT_a NOT_place NOT_of NOT_probable NOT_impending NOT_death NOT_and NOT_leave NOT_them NOT_to NOT_their NOT_own NOT_devices ,  the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman ,  the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer ,  the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes ,  the falling lift which just stops before hitting them ,  and more than anything else ,  the immortality of the bad guy . <br /><br />the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower ,  electrocuted ,  whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors ,  and then having apparently survived the explosion ,  fireball and total destruction of the labs ,  has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches . <br /><br />that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding .  even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself ,  and not NOT_even NOT_impressive NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_come NOT_anywhere NOT_near NOT_saving NOT_this NOT_one ,  which should be avoided at all costs . 
835 1 this movie has wild bill hickok ,  calamity jane ,  buffalo bill and general custer all together .  gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him .  this was the first time cecil b .  demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time .  this movie starts out with lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an indian war .  calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home .  this movie also deals with custer's last stand and is far from accurate .  gary cooper is good as usual and i usually don't NOT_like NOT_jean NOT_arthur NOT_but NOT_i NOT_liked NOT_her NOT_here . 
836 0 one could wish that an idea as good as the "invisible man" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects ,  but this is not NOT_the NOT_case .  the story ,  the characters and ,  finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's .  there are some great moments ,  mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets .  but alas ,  soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab ,  which means that the rest of the film is not NOT_only NOT_predictable ,  but schematic . <br /><br />there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years ,  and some of them have their charms .  but it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one .  it is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough ,  and as a result ,  "hollow man" is seriously undermined with clichã©s ,  sappy characters ,  predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever . <br /><br />however ,  the one thing that actually impressed me ,  beside the special effects ,  was the swearing .  when making this kind of film ,  modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them .  therefore ,  the language (and ,  sometimes ,  the violence and sex) is very toned down .  when the whole world blows up ,  the good guys go "oh darn!" and "oh my god" .  "hollow man" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them .  i'm not NOT_saying NOT_that NOT_the NOT_most NOT_natural NOT_response NOT_to NOT_something NOT_gone NOT_wrong NOT_is NOT_to NOT_swear NOT_- NOT_but NOT_it NOT_makes NOT_it NOT_more NOT_believable NOT_if NOT_someone NOT_actually NOT_swears .  i think we can thank verhoeven for that . 
837 1 this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level . however if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcock , cody and calamity jane then look elsewhere ,  as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend . the story moves with a cracking pace ,  and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie . the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout ,  also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior ,  he actually married one of demilles daughters in real life . indeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back ,  the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american history . so please take time out to watch this classic western . 
838 0 the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933 ,  a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible .  go ahead ,  take a look at the film ,  you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 ,  it was the first true special effects movie .  come 2000 ,  computer aided special effects seem like child's play ,  audiences are not NOT_blown NOT_away NOT_by NOT_special NOT_effects ,  instead they are disappointed if they are not NOT_done NOT_right .  the special effects in hollow man ,  the update of the hg wells story ,  are ok ,  but not NOT_the NOT_biggest NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_this NOT_film NOT_directed NOT_by NOT_paul NOT_verhoeven ,  who you might remember from showgirls and total recall .  kevin bacon plays sebastian caine ,  a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah ,  i know that's not NOT_a NOT_word) NOT_but NOT_of NOT_course NOT_is NOT_battling NOT_higher NOT_ups NOT_who NOT_are NOT_threatening NOT_to NOT_take NOT_away NOT_the NOT_team's NOT_funding .  so ,  as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do ,  he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah ,  i know ,  i used that non-word again) process .  the process has dire consequences ,  no NOT_caine NOT_does NOT_not NOT_die ,  but instead becomes a horny ,  violent creature ,  aka a guy .  now that he's invisible ,  caine stalks a sexy neighbor ,  a co-worker ,  former girlfriend linda (elisabeth shue) ,  and the man who took away his funding .  then a funny thing happens ,  caine becomes a new supernatural being ,  "the thing that won't NOT_die . " laughing in the face of all things natural ,  caine faces down death and spits in it's face ,  as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die ,  dragging the ending of the movie out .  the movie is silly ,  stupid ,  and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used ,  sometimes not .  there are neat possibilities in hollow man ,  but of course ,  not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them NOT_is NOT_explored .  for a more interesting look at an invisible being ,  get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema ,  and check out the 1933 invisible man .  kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back ,  probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano . 
839 1 this cecil b .  demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance ,  as a hysterical ,  eccentric ,  incurably amoral ,  but devotedly doting calamity jane .  she really pulled it off! gary cooper is at his most taciturn ,  but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'the plains are big ,  but trails cross  .  .  .  sometimes . ' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches .  all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james .  even abraham lincoln opens the story in person (or at least ,  demille would have us believe so) .  there is no NOT_room NOT_for NOT_anything NOT_so NOT_evanescent NOT_as NOT_subtlety ,  this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses .  a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex' .  it isn't NOT_just NOT_a NOT_story NOT_about NOT_gun-runners ,  but about arming anyone for money ,  and doing so from the heart of washington .  but let's not NOT_get NOT_into NOT_politics ,  let's leave that to demille ,  who can be guaranteed to be superficial .  the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil ,  who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography ,  'bad boy of music' .  antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns ,  whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky ,  celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies .  that is why it does not NOT_sound NOT_at NOT_all NOT_unusual ,  because we have heard it a thousand times .  but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore ,  and given it a soundtrack which has never NOT_varied NOT_since NOT_then ,  corny as it may be ,  but doubtless appropriate .  it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian .  gabby hayes is in there somewhere ,  but you miss him in the crowd .  gary cooper overtops them all ,  looming large ,  - but when did he ever loom small? 
840 0 for those who'd like to see this movie? i'd say: go! without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary .  but the music ,  the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me .  following several animals ,  their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching .  but the melodramatic point of view just doesn't NOT_cut NOT_it NOT_for NOT_me ,  moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene .  i ask myself why that happens ,  if they were to show reality ,  why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd ,  cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet . 
841 1 this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock .  he ,  buffalo bill cody ,  and calamity jane ,  are the central characters . <br /><br />as the civil war closes ,  lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice ,  "go west ,  young man , " which ,  mercifully ,  the film didn't NOT_erroneously NOT_attribute NOT_to NOT_horace NOT_greeley ,  as a number of others did .  but then ,  he gets assassinated ,  and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians . <br /><br />in the meantime ,  we see wild bill hickock ,  who interacts with a small boy ,  while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi .  wild bill uses a bowie knife ,  which he eventually gives to the boy ,  calling it an "arkansas toothpick , " which in reality was a different type of knife ,  though both were used throughout the frontier . <br /><br />hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody ,  who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man .  cody has just gotten married ,  and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down . <br /><br />when they arrive at their destination ,  they run into calamity jane ,  who has a crush on hickock .  she looks at cody's wife ,  and asks buffalo bill ,  "is this your mopsy?" the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem ,  since one definition of "mopsy" was prostitute .  demille wanted the line in ,  and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter's books about peter rabbit ,  three of the rabbits were flopsy ,  mopsy ,  and cottontail .  he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of ill virtue . " it worked; the line stayed in . <br /><br />the indians were getting restless ,  in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers .  cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area ,  so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area .  cody led the troops; hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief ,  who was an old acquaintance ,  and who was leading some of the hostile indians . <br /><br />calamity jane gets captured ,  and hickock gets captured trying to save her .  they are brought to the chief ,  and although neither would talk ,  torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane's willpower ,  and she tells the route cody is using . <br /><br />the two are released ,  and hickock joins up with cody and his forces ,  in part to alert them they're walking into a trap .  with hickok's help ,  they hold off the indian attack . <br /><br />hickock decides to go after the gun runners ,  and finally takes them prisoner .  as they're waiting for authorities ,  hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards . <br /><br />there are numerous historic anomalies in the film ,  but it retains the flavor of legend .  pretty good for the 1930s . 
842 0 my title above says it all .  let me make it clearer .  if you have seen the bbc's "planet earth"  ,  which i am sure most of you have  ,  then you are not NOT_gonna NOT_like NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_too NOT_much .  and i own all the discs of "planet earth" i had seen the rating for this movie very high  ,  and read good reviews about it .  i was excited to check it out . <br /><br />alas ,  i went to the theater and the movie started  ,  i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery .  and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear ,  i recognized them from my dvds at home of "planet earth" . <br /><br />the movie continued and went on and on and on  ,  me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from "planet earth" . <br /><br />we were very very disappointed  ,  as i think 90% of the footage is from "planet earth"  .  i am saying 90%  ,  because some of the scenes i didn't NOT_recognize .  i have a feeling that i simply didn't NOT_remember NOT_them . <br /><br />so finally what this movie really is  ,  is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of "planet earth"  ,  with a narration aimed at kids .  yes ,  the narration is quite kiddish .  let me give you an example .  when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub  ,  the narrator says "the polar cubs are not NOT_like NOT_human NOT_kids .  they don't NOT_always NOT_listen NOT_to NOT_their NOT_mothers" NOT_( NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_exact NOT_words NOT_ ,  but this is how it is ) so in a nutshell .  this is condensed "planet earth" for kids ! 
843 1 after the failure of "the crusades" at the box office ,  cecil b .  demille stopped doing films about non-american history .  his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii (dr .  wassell) .  the first in order of production was this film ,  starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok ,  with jean arthur as calamity jane .  james ellison was buffalo bill ,  john miljan (not a villain as usual) was general george a .  custer ,  and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn .  the villains were led by charles bickford (selling arms to the indians) and porter hall as jack mccall (who killed wild bill hickok) . <br /><br />basically the film takes up the history of the u . s .  after the civil war .  lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered .  lincoln talks about the need to secure the west (more about this point later) .  then he announces he has to go to the theater .  that april 14th must have been very busy for abe - in "virginia city" he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same date . <br /><br />actually ,  while lincoln was concerned about the west ,  his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and it's citizens into the union as soon as possible .  it was reconstruction that occupied his attention ,  not NOT_the NOT_west NOT_(except NOT_for NOT_the NOT_problems NOT_of NOT_maximillian NOT_and NOT_his NOT_french NOT_controlled NOT_forces NOT_in NOT_mexico NOT_against NOT_juarez) .  but he had been involved in actual problems with the west .  in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope ,  the loser at second manassas ,  to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux (the subject of mckinley kantor's novel ,  "sprit lake" .  pope ,  incompetent against lee and jackson ,  turned out to be quite effective here ,  and the revolt was smashed . <br /><br />however ,  with all lincoln's actual attention to western problems ,  it is doubtful that he says (as cooper repeats at least once) ,  "the frontier should be secure .

845 1 "the plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b .  demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual .  it sets up parallel plots for no NOT_less NOT_stellar NOT_an NOT_entourage NOT_than NOT_wild NOT_bill NOT_hickok NOT_(gary NOT_cooper) ,  buffalo bill cody (james ellison) ,  calamity jane (jean arthur) ,  george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact ,  even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place .  every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth ,  but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship .  the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people ,  who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends .  truly ,  this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment ,  but a pretty campy relic by today's standards . <br /><br />transfer: considering the vintage of the film ,  this is a moderately appealing transfer ,  with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks .  there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments .  all in all ,  the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent ,  but it is never NOT_all NOT_bad NOT_or NOT_all NOT_good NOT_â– NOT_just NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_better NOT_than NOT_middle NOT_of NOT_the NOT_road .  age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not NOT_distract .  the audio is mono but nicely balanced . <br /><br />extras: forget it .  it's universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid ,  this western is compelling and fun .  just take its characters and story with a grain of salt â– in some cases â– a whole box seems more appropriate! 
846 0 i don't NOT_know NOT_why ,  but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movie .  .  .  .  . all the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs .  .  . it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day-there are great moments ,  and it is always nice to listen to darth vader .  .  .  .  .  .  . oops ,  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  james earl jones speak ,  but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie  ,  considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film .  .  .  .  .  . it has been sanitized for a child audience ,  so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube  .  .  .  . i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not NOT_it

848 0 yesterday was earth day (april 22 ,  2009) in the us and other countries ,  and i went to see the full-feature movie-version of "earth" by disneynature .  i guess ,  like the auto manufacturers ,  disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet .  maybe they really do care about the planet ,  i don't NOT_know ,  but i don't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_warrants NOT_a NOT_special NOT_unit NOT_with NOT_the NOT_word NOT_"nature" NOT_in NOT_it .  i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse ,  and who am i to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about disney? <br /><br />aside from incredible cinematography ,  it was a typical disney disappointment for me .  preceded by a half-dozen disney movie trailers ,  rife with disney clichã© ("circle of life" ,  "falling with style") ,  over-dramatic music ,  recycled footage (disney claims "40% new footage") .  i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring .  i like james earl jones ,  but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin .  i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done ,  they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it . <br /><br />and what is disney's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals? there were a half-dozen such scenes ,  complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out .  i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents .  i was also cognizant of how disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change .  are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it's still a controversial subject? <br /><br />i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix .  nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment . 
849 1 i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing .  pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because ,  unlike thoroughbred jockeys ,  men of normal height and weight can be drivers .  <br /><br />yes ,  the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie ,  but it's also a very different movie .  april love is light and easy to watch ,  a feel good movie .  (disappointing though that pat boone's religious/moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl! quite a change from today's standard fare . ) home in indiana with walter brennan (filmed in black and white with no NOT_hint NOT_that NOT_anyone NOT_will NOT_ever NOT_burst NOT_into NOT_song) NOT_captures NOT_the NOT_stress NOT_and NOT_struggle NOT_better NOT_thereby NOT_making NOT_the NOT_ultimate NOT_accomplishment NOT_more NOT_satisfying NOT_but NOT_it NOT_requires NOT_a NOT_bigger NOT_emotional NOT_investment .

851 1 i would like to comment on the movie april love .  it's one of my all time favorites because my father ,  nelson malone plays the horse trainer .  i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ,  ky ,  where we were living at the time to make april love .  my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man .  i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered ,  and lo and behold he came home w/the script .  how exciting is that! also ,  a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park .  it's very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again ,  and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio .  timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex ,  foul language and violence .  it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus .  .  . 
852 0 don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong ,  the movie is beautiful ,  the shots are stunning ,  and the material is dramatic .  however ,  it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done . <br /><br />bbc's planet earth was all of the above and more .  it was subtle .  it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death .  there was tragedy and triumph ,  loss and gain .  it was balanced . <br /><br />disney's edit of earth is none of this .  they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about .  they made it dramatic .  they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us .  they made predators evil .  they made walruses evil .  they showed every encounter as negative .  it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded ,  but at the expense of the lesson of balance .  the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive . <br /><br />i am all for preventing global warning ,  but this was over the top political and environmental junk . <br /><br />that's another thing ,  i went to see it on the big screen ,  but was disappointed in the picture quality .  it looked better on my tv at home . <br /><br />if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture ,  go out and buy ,  rent ,  or borrow the bbc's planet earth series .  it is better lessons ,  better sound ,  and (if you have blu-ray)better picture quality . 
853 1 having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon ,  i can think of no NOT_better NOT_way NOT_to NOT_spend NOT_a NOT_lazy NOT_friday NOT_evening NOT_then NOT_putting NOT_in NOT_my NOT_two NOT_cents NOT_worth .  especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it .  doesn't NOT_every NOT_movie ,  good or bad deserve more than four comments? and this movie isn't NOT_bad NOT_at NOT_all . <br /><br />the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came ,  in this case the late fifties .  films were pretty much a happy medium back then .  the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television .  i don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_many NOT_people NOT_were NOT_pried NOT_away NOT_from NOT_the NOT_boob NOT_tube NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_one ,  but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes . <br /><br />teen idol pat boone plays nick conover ,  a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta (jeanette nolan) and uncle jed (arthur o'connell) out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car .  it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (jed jr . )so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living .  aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums .  story lines like this being what they are ,  jed and nick don't NOT_really NOT_care NOT_for NOT_each NOT_other NOT_too NOT_much NOT_of NOT_course .  jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors ,  fran (dolores michaels)and liz (shirley jones)templeton .  immediately jed develops a crush on fran ,  and of course i don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_that NOT_liz NOT_develops NOT_a NOT_crush NOT_on NOT_jed .  then there's the matter of uncle jed's horse ,  a trotter who has turned wild and won't NOT_let NOT_anyone NOT_handle NOT_him NOT_since NOT_the NOT_death NOT_of NOT_jed NOT_jr .  you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own ,  seeing as how there are no NOT_real NOT_surprises .  doesn't NOT_matter NOT_though ,  you'll enjoy yourself anyway . <br /><br />once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone ,  as a supposedly bad boy ,  you'll have no NOT_trouble NOT_with NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film .  considering that ,  boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick .  certainly the role doesn't NOT_require NOT_much NOT_depth ,  but still it's a nicely done job when you would least expect it .  as jed ,  arthur o'connell is the perfect choice for the role .  in the early going ,  he is unreachable and cold ,  but as he slowly warms up to nick ,  we see that he's really a pretty good guy .  jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta ,  who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick .  shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents .  as liz ,  she's gorgeous to look at ,  great to listen to ,  and quite funny at times .  dolores michaels as fran ,  who is a bit more on the wild side ,  is equally entertaining . <br /><br />the best thing about april love ,  is that there is not NOT_a NOT_true NOT_mean NOT_conniving NOT_character NOT_of NOT_any NOT_sort NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen .  not NOT_one NOT_true NOT_villain NOT_in NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing .  everybody is so darn likable you can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_enjoy NOT_the NOT_film .  i truthfully find it quite refreshing ,  sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends .  think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers ,  a little more plot ,  and wide screen technicolor .  the songs are a mixed bag ,  with the title song april love being the best of them .  another thing i really liked is that they didn't NOT_fall NOT_back NOT_on NOT_using NOT_blue NOT_screen NOT_backdrops NOT_during NOT_the NOT_horse NOT_racing NOT_sequences ,  and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it .  as a matter of fact ,  you'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn't NOT_skimp NOT_in NOT_that NOT_department .  the chemistry between jones and boone is good .  best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect . <br /><br />this movie will never NOT_be NOT_confused NOT_with NOT_great NOT_cinema .  yet ,  sometimes instead of going to disneyland ,  one just needs a nice outing in the park ,  and that's what april love is . <br /><br />my grade: b+<br /><br />

855 1 one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen .  there isn't NOT_much NOT_to NOT_the NOT_plot ,  but the acting- incredible .  you see the characters change ever so subtly ,  undr the influence of the rented villa in italy ,  and love .  and happiness .  the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you ,  much as the villa does on all the women .  truly "enchanted" . 
856 0 wow ,  a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never NOT_set NOT_foot NOT_in NOT_nyc .  you know there's a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour .  the characters are boring ,  john cusack's accent is laughable ,  and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable .  a horrible movie . 
857 1 two women ,  sick of their controlling husbands ,  taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different women . they come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant - ivory . <br /><br />great scenery and the location isn't NOT_bad NOT_either .  seriously ,  a very good period piece 7 of 10 
858 0 i was lured to see this movie by its starpower ,  but ultimately that's all it delivers .  it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption .  it's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense .  we know who the bad guys are from the beginning ,  and just follow along as they fall like dominoes .  the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex ,  but has forgotten to substitute good ,  clean romance or excitement in any other way .  all the flavor of a good ,  flat decaffeinated diet cola .  "q&a" ,  which also takes place in new york ,  is a far better alternative ,  as is "la confidential" . 
859 1 it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism .  the only two movies i can think of is "enchanted april" (1992) and "the enchanted cottage" (1945) .  both movies used wonderful actors not NOT_stars .  in both movies ,  all the actors gave their best romantic performances . <br /><br />"enchanted april" is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation .  it is amazing "enchanted april" was made in 1992 .  it stands out as an enjoyable classic . 
860 0 wow .  this is really not NOT_that NOT_good .  <br /><br />i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good .  .  .  it is ,  but it is nothing special . <br /><br />the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies . <br /><br />*/**** 
861 1 this was a very good film .  i didn't NOT_go NOT_into NOT_it NOT_with NOT_very NOT_high NOT_expectations NOT_and NOT_was NOT_pleasantly NOT_surprised NOT_by NOT_the NOT_acting ,  the script ,  and the scenery .  miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright .  they stole the show .  but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also .  very enjoyable film . 
862 0 admittedly ,  i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure .  he was a fine actor until scent of a woman ,  where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably .  i hoped this film ,  of which i'd heard almost nothing growing up ,  would be a nice little gem .  an overlooked ,  ahead-of-its-time ,  intelligent and engaging city-political thriller .  it's not . <br /><br />city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters ,  names ,  and "realistic" citywide issues ,  that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating ,  that once you find out the truth ,  it will blow your mind .  in truth ,  however ,  these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power ,  two-faced politicians ,  mafia with police ties ,  etc .  and theoretically ,  this setup allows for some thrilling tension ,  the fear that none of the characters are safe ,  and anything could happen! but again ,  it really doesn't . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  the only things that happen are quite predictable ,  and we're left with several "confession" monologues ,  that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts ,  a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society .  but after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups ,  the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal .  i don't NOT_think NOT_we're NOT_left NOT_with NOT_that NOT_in NOT_city NOT_hall ,  and while it's a very full film ,  i don't NOT_find NOT_it NOT_altogether NOT_rich . 
863 1 it starts slowly ,  showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april ,  but don't NOT_give NOT_up NOT_on NOT_it .  nothing much happens ,  but the time passes exquisitely ,  and there are numerous sly jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm ,  which i find hilarious) .  the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word ,  the scenery is beautiful (as is polly walker) ,  and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying . <br /><br />the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book ,  the biggest being with the arbuthnot/briggs/dester business ,  but i actually preferred the movie's version of this (it may be more sentimental ,  but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story ,  and anyway i like sentiment when it's well done) . <br /><br />an excellent movie ,  especially as a date movie during lousy weather . 
864 0 this movie had the potential to be far more than it was .  but it not NOT_only NOT_fails NOT_to NOT_deliver ,  it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time . <br /><br />john cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil .  the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent ,  which he noticeably loses several times each scene . <br /><br />al pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck .  he's good as usual but hardly standout . <br /><br />supporting cast -- throw in female romantic interest which added little ,  if anything ,  to the story .  speaking of the story ,  a convoluted "who really cares" tale where cusack is the self-righteous mayor's boy who just has to search for "the right thing" to be done . <br /><br />people don't NOT_act NOT_this NOT_way .  cusack's character loses all credibility at the end ,  of which without revealing it ,  is preach and nauseous .  the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound .  it's also completely inaccurate but i won't NOT_get NOT_into NOT_law . <br /><br />this is a bad ,  by the numbers movie .  it seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy ,  proselytizing ,  self-righteous film for the last hour .  better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk . 
865 1 i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence ,  who i knew<br /><br />from whose line is it anyway? ,  the wacky british improvisational<br /><br />comedy show .  i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem .  it is uplifting ,  touching ,  and<br /><br />romantic without being sappy or sentimental .  the characters are<br /><br />all real people ,  with real foibles ,  fears and needs .  see it . ! 
866 0 this film is predictable; it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass ,  when he huts the ball for the jets .  one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film .  the politics reminds me when i was back east .  many people know when the fix is in .  i gave this four because of the acting ,  but the story is lame . 
867 1 this is one of those rare movies ,  it's lovely and compelling ,  dignified and quirky ,  a true gift .  i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy ,  or any vacation at all ,  because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience (yup ,  find the magic) .  i especially loved josie lawrence ,  as lottie wilkins ,  but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film .  further the costumes ,  if you're drawn to fashion and costumes ,  are extraordinarily well done .  i just wish they'd release it on dvd because i'm wearing my tape version out! <br /><br />absolutely well worth your time ,  just make sure to settle in to watch it ,  without any interruptions . 
868 0 already his first claim ,  that desires are always artificial ,  is totally fallacious . <br /><br />when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies â– or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own .  although far ,  far more intelligent than ,  say ,  paris hilton (i know ,  not NOT_too NOT_difficult) NOT_zizek's NOT_mouth NOT_spews NOT_just NOT_as NOT_much NOT_baloney NOT_as NOT_hers ,  just a different kind .  he combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy .  both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories ,  to rant without a beginning or end ,  and to connect concepts almost randomly ,  in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love .  example: there are three main marx brothers hence what a "great" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness ,  the id ,  the ego and the super-ego .  i'm kind of surprised he didn't NOT_play NOT_a NOT_clip NOT_from NOT_"snowhite" NOT_and NOT_make NOT_an NOT_analogy NOT_between NOT_the NOT_seven NOT_dwarfs NOT_and NOT_the NOT_seven NOT_levels NOT_of NOT_gahannah NOT_(moslem NOT_hell) .  it's like the premise of schumacher's "the number 23": play with numbers long enough ,  and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want ,  even linking ancient greeks with princess di's death . <br /><br />however ,  there is an entertainment element to tpgtc: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun .  why watch "cuckoo's nest" or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours? it's like watching an amusing train wreck .  admittedly ,  he is almost funny on one or two occasions . <br /><br />i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science .  giving idiotic movies like "birds" this much thought ,  hence this much credit ,  probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave .  the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value ,  and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't NOT_require NOT_a NOT_shrink-turned-philosopher NOT_to NOT_draw NOT_one NOT_a NOT_map NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_them NOT_â– NOT_unless NOT_one NOT_is NOT_a NOT_complete NOT_idiot .  zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies .  hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days .  .  . <br /><br />when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the "psycho" shower scene ,  i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh's blood .  or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh's vagina ,  with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation) ,  this representing some kind of "clever (zizekian) irony" .  speaking of which ,  the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script) ,  his movies wouldn't NOT_have NOT_been NOT_the NOT_illogical ,  far-fetched crap that they often are .  the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about "hidden ,  deep meanings" .  and when you add zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology ,  layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations ,  you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i . e .  the easily impressionable and the gullible . <br /><br />zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here ,  one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with "the satisfaction of work ,  of a job well done" .  don't NOT_laugh .  .  .  neither hitchcock nor the writer of "psycho" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene .  talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth ,  but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to "say" . <br /><br />i like zizek's initial thoughts on tarkovsky's terrific "solaris" ,  but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory . <br /><br />zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone .  "i just want to play with it all day!" logic has its rules ,  and is not NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_raped NOT_- NOT_at NOT_least NOT_not NOT_publicly NOT_- NOT_by NOT_the NOT_likes NOT_of NOT_him .  he seems to regard logic ,  proof ,  common-sense ,  and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided ,  twisted to fit the end-goal ,  or simply annihilated .  zizek is the lsd-tripped hippie ,  and all his favorite movies are his own personal "2001"s . <br /><br />the fact that zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often lack intelligence ,  if anything - such as hitchcock and lynch ,  only further diminishes his already low credibility .  i was surprised de palma didn't NOT_feature NOT_more NOT_prominently; NOT_that's NOT_another NOT_lame NOT_director NOT_who NOT_writes NOT_inept NOT_scripts .  zizek has a field day with lynch's incomprehensible "lost highway" .  there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it . <br /><br />zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier's laughable ,  "ground-breaking" physical set-up in "dogville" made me snicker .  <br /><br />however ,  zizek doesn't NOT_only NOT_make NOT_up NOT_stuff NOT_as NOT_he NOT_goes NOT_along ,  he also indulges heavily in the "bleedin' obvious" .  like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron) ,  he wraps his very trite "observations" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language .  after all ,  sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know ,  but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener . <br /><br />i was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit .  .  . <br /><br />slavoj zizek: soon as a stalker in a kid's park near you . <br /><br />http://rateyourmusic . com/list/fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/ 
869 1 nice character development in a pretty cool milieu .  being a male ,  i'm probably not NOT_qualified NOT_to NOT_totally NOT_understand NOT_it ,  but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start .  it isn't NOT_as NOT_bleak NOT_as NOT_it NOT_really NOT_was NOT_and NOT_the NOT_treatment NOT_of NOT_women NOT_was NOT_probably NOT_even NOT_harsher .  what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters .  each has their own "thing" that they contend with .  once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs ,  they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion .  what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't NOT_go NOT_for NOT_cheap NOT_comedy NOT_when NOT_it NOT_could NOT_have .  it didn't NOT_try NOT_to NOT_pound NOT_a NOT_lesson NOT_into NOT_us .  the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light .  i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly ,  but ,  within this world ,  it needed to happen .  good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people . 
870 0 an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies .  you get your hitchcock ,  your chaplin ,  your bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies .  to disguise that he has no NOT_clue NOT_what NOT_is NOT_going NOT_on NOT_in NOT_cinemas NOT_these NOT_days ,  he throws in the matrix . <br /><br />but it's not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_same NOT_lame NOT_film-as-art NOT_speech NOT_all NOT_over NOT_again .  this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego ,  anal phase ,  sexual insufficiency .  <br /><br />it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about .  for someone who is supposed to know much about movies ,  his own is ,  cinematographicly speaking: yeiks . <br /><br />to put it in zizek's own words - i saw 5\-\!7 on the screen ,  last night ,  or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />mr .  (zizek) ,  what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard .  at no NOT_point NOT_in NOT_your NOT_rambling ,  incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought .  everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it .  i award you (two) points (only) ,  and may god have mercy on your soul . 
871 1 two thirds of nearly 2 , 000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 ,  9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (was this a record ,  or merely a faulty vcr?) .  although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination .  but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never NOT_felt NOT_the NOT_urge NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_it .  my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnim's original book .  my wife loves reading but her sight no NOT_longer NOT_allows NOT_her NOT_to NOT_read NOT_much NOT_so NOT_she NOT_borrowed NOT_it NOT_in NOT_talking NOT_book NOT_form .  such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things ,  but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing ,  although in no NOT_way NOT_syrupy ,  and was also very well written .  i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film ,  and so decided to buy her the videotape .  i am now very glad that i did ,  and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no NOT_fireworks NOT_but NOT_with NOT_well NOT_constructed NOT_character NOT_development NOT_and NOT_a NOT_very NOT_successful NOT_pre-mussolini NOT_italian NOT_atmosphere .  the story is set in the immediate post ww1 period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together ,  away from their families ,  in a rented villa in italy .  force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds .  its theme is essentially no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_the NOT_interactions NOT_that NOT_take NOT_place NOT_as NOT_their NOT_holiday NOT_progresses ,  not NOT_only NOT_between NOT_these NOT_four NOT_very NOT_disparate NOT_mature NOT_ladies ,  but also with the occasional male visitor .  if you want action ,  thrills ,  dramatic sex scenes ,  natural or man-made disasters ,  or harlequin style romances this would not NOT_be NOT_the NOT_film NOT_for NOT_you .  but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch ,  and if you care to give it a try you may ,  as i did ,  come to rank it among your much loved films . <br /><br />it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar .  in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film ,  but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book ,  effectively unrolled before my eyes .  (perhaps italy itself has some part in this ,  the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccio's decameron on tv . ) generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal ,  but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events .  this works very well ,  although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story .  great credit is due to the director ,  mike newell ,  and all members of the cast ,  particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies . 
872 0 if you've ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says ,  "jesus is the answer .  what's the question?" ,  then perhaps you should thank god if you've never NOT_met NOT_a NOT_lacanian .  slavoj zizek ,  the most evangelical of lacanians ,  would surely exchange the word "jesus" in that statement for "lacan/hegel" . <br /><br />zizek's star burns brightly at the moment ,  no NOT_doubt NOT_because NOT_we NOT_generally NOT_view NOT_films NOT_and NOT_pop NOT_culture NOT_purely NOT_as NOT_entertainment NOT_for NOT_our NOT_consumption .  so it seems impressive when someone - anyone - comes along and says ,  "hang on ,  films may say something about ourselves . "<br /><br />the ideas zizek expounds in this film are "true" purely because he says so .  for example ,  zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego ,  superego and id (god knows what happened to zeppo ,  or gummo â… perhaps they're the sinthome .  .  . or is that movies themselves?) .  this is simply what they are .  in zizek's output ,  culture is not NOT_there NOT_to NOT_be NOT_investigated NOT_but NOT_merely NOT_to NOT_be NOT_held NOT_as NOT_an NOT_example NOT_of NOT_his NOT_ideology .  people may object that he certainly has something to say - but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god's will?<br /><br />what's wrong with taking examples ,  from films or anywhere ,  to illustrate theory? well ,  nothing at all .  as zizek seems to believe ,  they may even serve as a proof .  however ,  it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context .  without context ,  you can say and prove anything you want .  for zizek ,  lacan is the answer â– so he goes and makes an example of it .  everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out ,  to serve this ideology .  for instance ,  zizek's exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop .  but ,  in the context of the film ,  this is not NOT_a NOT_voyeur's NOT_fantasy NOT_position NOT_at NOT_all .  stewart has been deliberately led there by novak .  this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek's two hour and a half cinematic sermon . <br /><br />his analysis of the "baby wants to f---" scene in blue velvet is laughable .  touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific (to the masculine) truth of "feminine jouissance" ,  zizek says that isabella rossilini's character not NOT_only NOT_demands NOT_her NOT_degradation NOT_but NOT_is ,  unconsciously ,  in charge of the situation .  this is an example of her "jouissance" .  well  .  .  .  possibly .  but - sorry to be prosaic - where is the evidence for this? in the film ,  she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son .  zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan .  but this may be due to any number of things .  isn't NOT_that NOT_the NOT_point NOT_of NOT_so-called NOT_feminine NOT_"jouissance"? NOT_according NOT_to NOT_lacan ,  feminine jouissance ,  unlike phallic jouissance ,  cannot be articulated ,  it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language .  if this is right ,  then no NOT_example NOT_can NOT_be NOT_made NOT_of NOT_it .  it also means that the entire concept is non-sensical and entirely mystical .  it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek: "there's feminine jouissance for you! why is this feminine jouissance? because i say so . " <br /><br />what example can really be garnered from these films? only zizek's psychology .  why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films ,  even to the point that ,  when in a boat on botega bay ,  he says he wants to f--- rod steiger too? is this not NOT_the NOT_wish-fulfilment NOT_of NOT_someone NOT_who NOT_spends NOT_his NOT_life NOT_critiquing NOT_films? NOT_as NOT_the NOT_saying NOT_goes ,  freud would have a field day with the pervert's guide to the cinema - but with zizek himself ,  nobody else . <br /><br />zizek's theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it ,  but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws .  this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely - as to be almost useless - how the rest of us desire .  for ,  as any psychoanalyst knows ,  how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated - and cannot be easily universalised ,  if at all .  zizek's love of making everything an example of lacan's answer bears this out: how do we desire? like this ,  this is how i do it .  problem is ,  in zizek's desire ,  everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire .  but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don't NOT_like NOT_letting NOT_the NOT_"subject" NOT_speak NOT_for NOT_itself . <br /><br />the pervert's guide to the cinema is a summation zizek's love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political (what dogma isn't?) .  zizek has never NOT_questioned NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_his NOT_motives NOT_might NOT_be NOT_when NOT_embarking NOT_on NOT_an NOT_analysis ,  what he is trying to discover ,  because the terms of his exploration ,  and therefore his ethics in doing so ,  are never NOT_put NOT_into NOT_question . <br /><br />zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing .  he's a kind of henry ford of cultural theory: mass-production and any colour as long as it's black .  he is perfect for today's highly consumerist society: supposedly critical while giving people the same c-ap over and over and pretending that it is something different .  this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems - which capitalism always claims to provide - rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all .  which is kind of like being brain dead .  for me ,  zizek's third matrix pill is a suicide capsule . <br /><br />ps: i loved zizek's solemn remark - presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity - that music in films can greatly affect people's sympathies .  did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws?

874 0 (spoilers)<br /><br />i was very curious to see this film ,  after having heard that it was clever and witty .  i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt . <br /><br />the idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves ,  through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience .  what made me dislike the whole film were two things . <br /><br />first of all ,  the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if ,  by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis ,  it became itself ordinary and dull . <br /><br />secondly ,  the overall sloppiness of the production ,  with dialogues that were barely understandable . <br /><br />too bad . 
875 1 enchanted april is a tone poem ,  an impressionist painting ,  a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words .  it has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out .  i continue to wait ,  albeit less patiently ,  for the film to come out in dvd format .  apparently ,  i am not NOT_alone . <br /><br />if parent company amazon's listings are correct ,  there are many people who want this title in dvd format .  many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script .  many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries .  the cast is spectacular ,  the cinematography and direction impeccable .  the film is a definite keeper .  many have already asked .  please add our names to the list . 
876 0 this is an "anthology" horror film .  it's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch (who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h . p .  lovecraft ,  but is most famous for the original story "psycho") .  the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn't NOT_think NOT_very NOT_much NOT_about NOT_the NOT_film NOT_was NOT_creepy NOT_or NOT_horrific NOT_at NOT_all .  it would have been better to do it as a comedy like "comedy of terrors . " only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way ,  and it's probably the best of them (the one with ingrid pitt) .  i've seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis' "tales from the crypt . " the anthology style works well for the producers ,  because it means that they can hire a bunch of "big name" actors ,  employ them for only one week of shooting or so ,  and then bring in the next big name .  so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee .  but that's very unfortunate for the audience ,  because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing ,  christopher lee ,  and ingrid pitt actually acting together .  instead they're stuck in these vignettes by themselves .  so let's take them one at a time ,  briefly . <br /><br />the first story has denholm elliot ,  who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character .  unfortunately the actor who plays dominic ,  the source of the horror ,  tom adams ,  just looks silly which ruins any possible horror .  there's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though ,  like the scene where dominic kills elliot's psychiatrist .  it's the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching ,  so the whole audience is supposed to shout out "look out behind you!" the second story is the one with peter cushing .  god i love that man so much .  too bad so many of his films ,  like this one ,  pretty much stink .  in the story he's supposed to be pining away for a long-lost love ,  and he sees her likeness in a wax museum .  it's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere . <br /><br />then you have the bit with christopher lee ,  where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch .  again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs .  but instead we're supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil .  the actress ,  chloe franks ,  was pretty good in that type of "bad seed" role though . <br /><br />the last story is kind of amusing .  .  .  ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire .  that's about all the story has to offer .  i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt's english is ,  i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i've seen her in . <br /><br />not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists .

878 0 just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better "murder ,  she wrote" ,  it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years .  i'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do ,  or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show .  van dyke ,  who only had a decent career in the 1960s ,  never NOT_was NOT_much NOT_of NOT_an NOT_actor NOT_at NOT_all NOT_(by NOT_his NOT_own NOT_admission) NOT_and NOT_he NOT_was NOT_already NOT_far NOT_too NOT_old NOT_to NOT_play NOT_a NOT_doctor NOT_when NOT_the NOT_series NOT_began NOT_in NOT_1993 .  he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking .  his talentless real life son barry ,  a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't NOT_involve NOT_his NOT_father ,  plays his son in the series . 
879 1 the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_grow NOT_from NOT_their NOT_experiences NOT_and NOT_emerge NOT_from NOT_the NOT_experience NOT_altered NOT_in NOT_some NOT_significant NOT_way NOT_(note NOT_that NOT_this NOT_change NOT_need NOT_not NOT_be NOT_positive NOT_or NOT_beneficial) NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end . <br /><br />by that measure ,  enchanted april is a resounding success .  as a film in general ,  it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast ,  well-developed characters you come to care about ,  wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations .  in short the film is ,  well ,  enchanting .  although all the performances are first-rate ,  three must be mentioned-josie lawrence ,  jim broadbent and joan plowright .  it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast .  most highly recommended ,  particularly if you are a romantic at heart .  further deponent saith not . 
880 0 ** here be spoilers ** <br /><br />recap: mia (helin) is returning home from capital stockholm to rural rã¤ttvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday .  she is by far the youngest child ,  and has two sisters eivor (ernst) and gunilla (petrã©n) .  eivor has a family and still lives in rã¤ttvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away .  mia is still single and is focused on her career .  there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle .  as the party goes on (and alcohol consumed) ,  more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise .  .  . <br /><br />comments: to be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years .  there are really no NOT_new NOT_elements NOT_or NOT_ideas .  this movie draws upon three basic areas .  1) embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves .  2) sorrow and 3) anxiety .  this move has the focus on the last one ,  almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along .  no NOT_loss NOT_though ,  since the humor that is there is not NOT_funny .  the performances from the cast are good i guess ,  though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten .  i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences ,  but there were none .  to conclude ,  there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this . <br /><br />3/10 
881 1 my all-time favorite movie .  oscar-caliber work by everyone involved ,  both in front of and behind the camera .  the screenplay is perfect ,  and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way ,  unlike the novel .  the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes ,  and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment .  it is josie lawrence's best work by far ,  and transformed my opinion of joan plowright .  having watched this movie at least 50 times ,  i can find no NOT_fault NOT_in NOT_it .  the music ,  by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel .

NOT_just NOT_weird NOT_animal NOT_monster-looking NOT_creatures NOT_with NOT_big NOT_mouths ,  pointed teeth and bulgy eyes! the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly! the theme song is terrible and irritating! also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows .  it surprised me how this show got 7 . 5/10 votes of other imdb viewers .  television really isn't NOT_what NOT_is NOT_used NOT_to NOT_be!

883 1 this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life .  the pacing ,  the camera work ,  the emotion ,  the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see .  it isn't NOT_easily NOT_appreciated NOT_by NOT_the NOT_immature NOT_or NOT_emotionally NOT_stunted .  the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasn't NOT_captured NOT_in NOT_a NOT_more NOT_technically NOT_perfect NOT_film NOT_format .  it deserved todd-ao ,  technicolor and the very finest sound format available . (an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter . ) the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard .  as it is ,  it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film .  i can't NOT_stop NOT_myself NOT_from NOT_watching NOT_it NOT_every NOT_time NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_on NOT_satelite .  the transformations of the characters from contained ,  tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often . <br /><br />the casting is perfect ,  the mood is perfect ,  the acting is above reproach .  it is a film about middle age and the choices people make . it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness .  watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you .  if you don't NOT_get NOT_it ,  perhaps you haven't lived enough ,  or something else is wrong with you . 
884 0 this game was made by sega .  being made by sega i didn't NOT_expect NOT_much ,  but i also didn't NOT_expect NOT_this NOT_junk NOT_either .  for starters the camera angles work against you in this game .  the motorcycle is your means of getting around .  the motorcycle is the worst part in the game .  whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't NOT_move .  you never NOT_fall NOT_off NOT_the NOT_bike NOT_or NOT_wreck NOT_for NOT_that NOT_matter .  the main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him .  the graphics are horrible .  you ride through trees on your bike .  the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible .  this game wouldn't NOT_even NOT_be NOT_worth NOT_renting . 
885 1 this is what i call a growth movie .  every character is different and better at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love" .  josie lawrence ,  who is best known as a comedienne ,  really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes .  even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men .  the book stayed very true to the novel ,  which is a plus in my book ,  since i am a librarian .  the scenery breath-taking and the message of love genuine . 
886 0 overall an extremely disappointing picture .  very ,  very slow build up to the basic storyline .  the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past .  (every take seems to last foreverâ… .  there is really no NOT_rhythm NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film . ) ***spoilers*** her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis ,  by a german woman ,  played by katja riemann .  the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional ,  so stereotypical .  ***spoilers end*** the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something .  please when you do that ,  give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place .  there is never NOT_a NOT_clear NOT_indication NOT_of NOT_time NOT_â– NOT_very NOT_annoying .  worst part is ,  the end .  ***spoilers*** the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented ,  simply by a bureaucratic accident! give me a break .  that's how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse? the question of who freed the jews is never NOT_answered .  was is goebels who freed them? did lean fischer sleep with goebels? in venice the film won an acting award for k .  riemann ,  why? â– i have no NOT_idea .  must be the jewish themeâ… 
887 1 i first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released .  room with a view was also newly out .  enchanted april had so much more to offer! i found it much more real and earthy ,  the characters more believable for being 'normal' .  by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice ,  i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation ,  peace ,  liberty or love .  you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known ,  that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting .  but in the heat of the spring in april ,  everyone's lives loosen and unravel (in line with the victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction .  what a little gem of a film! how come it isn't NOT_more NOT_well NOT_known? 
888 0 (spoilers in this)<br /><br />"rosenstraãÿe" is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time .  but it is way too long ,  it is not NOT_touching NOT_and NOT_sometimes NOT_even NOT_boring! NOT_there NOT_are NOT_too NOT_many NOT_clichã©s NOT_and NOT_not NOT_enough NOT_good NOT_acting . <br /><br />the storytelling (storyline) is bad .  like in james cameronâ´s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live .  good ,  now weâ´ve got a point of view .  than there is another woman introduced who does the same .  confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people! come on! this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling .  .  . how can riemann know about the fate of the little girlâ´s mother and her interrogation for example?<br /><br />the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place .  for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian .  when did that happen? the scene looks like it is set in the twenties .  .  . <br /><br />riemannâ´s character is of course a talented pianist ,  well ,  she is even a baroness! wow .  her brother comes back from the eastern front ,  he has received a "ritterkreuz" which he is showing in some scenes .  so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience .  and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans .  he even made some photographs! and so it goes ,  clichã© after clichã© is piling up and this is why the movie does not NOT_work . <br /><br />basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie .  and in the end itâ´s all very simple .  riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and - ta da! - everyone is free .  which is not NOT_a NOT_historical NOT_fact NOT_but NOT_pure NOT_imagination NOT_despite NOT_the NOT_"true NOT_story" NOT_claim NOT_at NOT_the NOT_beginning .  like "sass" it is vaguely based on a true event . <br /><br />it is sad but true ,  this is the typical german movie these days .  it is bad! macaulay j .  connor<br /><br /> 
889 1 this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep ,  and that's meaning it as a compliment .  because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century ,  most notably adaptations of e .  m .  forster novels ,  this very merchant-ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 .  it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson ,  having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage ,  and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game .  here ,  she plays a quiet ,  serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot ,  one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins ,  embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery .  they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one caroline dester ,  played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks (and not NOT_just NOT_in NOT_the NOT_style NOT_of NOT_hair NOT_she NOT_wears) ,  and mrs .  fisher (joan plowright) .  this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming ,  dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it ,  but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be .  alfred molina and jim broadbent (then relatively new to american audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters ,  and all in all ,  mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements ,  full of quiet moments and wonder . 
890 0 one thing that astonished me about this film (and not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_good NOT_way) NOT_was NOT_that NOT_nathan NOT_stoltzfus ,  who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse ,  was one of the historians working on this film ,  considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded .  <br /><br />another reviewer said that von trotta said she never NOT_meant NOT_for NOT_lena NOT_to NOT_bed NOT_goebbels ,  but in that case ,  why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? why not NOT_show NOT_other NOT_possible NOT_reasons NOT_for NOT_the NOT_mens' NOT_release ,  such as the disaster that was stalingrad ,  or the nazis' fear that the international press ,  based in berlin ,  would find out about the protest . <br /><br />also ,  why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again? surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history! in places ,  it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common . <br /><br />overall ,  this film failed in its aim ,  which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance ,  which is a shame ,  because done better ,  it could have had a major impact . 
891 1 i first saw enchanted april about five years ago .  i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas .  it's about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april ,  leaving their humdrum lives behind them .  they are very sad women at the outset of the film ,  and you can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_root NOT_them NOT_on NOT_as NOT_they NOT_plan NOT_this NOT_get-away NOT_with NOT_two NOT_other NOT_women NOT_they NOT_invite NOT_along NOT_to NOT_share NOT_the NOT_expenses .  this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen .  it' pure and simple ,  with no NOT_car NOT_chases ,  no NOT_animosities NOT_and NOT_no NOT_deaths .  it was made with care and in very good taste .  you cannot help but smile all through it -- except when you're crying happy tears! 
892 0 this was disappointing .  it started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar ,  it fell flat .  maria schrader's acting is dreadful ,  never NOT_seeming NOT_to NOT_mean NOT_what NOT_she NOT_says ,  or even knowing what she says until she says it .  she showed no NOT_genuine NOT_emotion NOT_at NOT_all ,  not NOT_for NOT_her NOT_beloved NOT_goy ,  or her mother's story .  when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lena's story .  there never NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_real NOT_relationship NOT_between NOT_lena NOT_and NOT_her NOT_mother NOT_except NOT_her NOT_mother NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_having NOT_a NOT_good NOT_time NOT_at NOT_the NOT_wedding ,  which isn't NOT_much .  the supposed parallel between hannah's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clichã© as they come ,  and failed miserably anyway .  the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish .  the climax of the protest was uninspiring ,  and no NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_lena NOT_had NOT_or NOT_had NOT_not NOT_done NOT_to NOT_influence NOT_the NOT_outcome ,  she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time ,  a haunted look ,  an inexplicable ambivalence .  in fact ,  none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark .  it was very hard to care about any of them ,  even little ruth .  everything with luis was a distraction .  (why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? there was no NOT_context NOT_or NOT_explanation NOT_whatever NOT_for NOT_that . ) if every reference to him was removed it wouldn't NOT_be NOT_noticed .  <br /><br />a simple story made confusing by poor character development (who was whose mother ,  again??) weak acting ,  and directing that made everyone look like they were acting .  you could almost hear "quiet on the set! .  .  .  . " i started thinking this was worthy of a 7 ,  but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 ,  then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene .  this was about as cold and sterile a movie as i have seen .  a terrible waste of a good story . 
893 1 one of my all time favourite films ,  ever .  just beautiful ,  full of human emotion ,  wit ,  humour ,  intelligence .  the story grows ,  as does the lesson of life ,  just a wonderful film in so many ways . <br /><br />the cast are also fantasic .  .  .  .  .  a great selection of the finest british talent around .  i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film . <br /><br />italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this ,  - everything about this film works . <br /><br /> i love it :) 
894 0 well ,  what can you say about sitcoms .  there often quite lame ,  morale dedicative ,  and just plain .  so is this show! it got a boring cast ,  although a . bynes is okej in her perky way ,  the rest is just stereotypical crap .  .  .  . as always .  we have all seen it before ,  and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled .  cause ,  lets face it ,  its a mediocre and self righteous show .  as the most sitcoms are .  .  .  . <br /><br />well ,  in short .  if you wanna see some good entertainment ,  you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror .  do some faces and move on .  .  .  .  its more entertaining than this show! 
895 1 this is one of the best movies .  it is one of my favorites .  a movie with good acting .  the story is very sensitive and touching .  good camera work also . <br /><br />the names of the actresses and actors are not NOT_at NOT_the NOT_top NOT_of NOT_the NOT_american NOT_star NOT_list .  however ,  they give equal or better performances than the top of the list . <br /><br />it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love ,  romance ,  friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world . <br /><br />if you don't NOT_like NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_then NOT_you NOT_have NOT_no NOT_heart NOT_or NOT_feelings .  then go watch a sports movie .  there is no NOT_killing NOT_or NOT_horror NOT_here .  see the movie .  it is a must .  th 
896 0 what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written .  these women have no NOT_self-respect NOT_or NOT_dignity .  the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys .  amanda bynes' talent is completely wasted .  she was brilliant on "all that" and her own show .  why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid ,  airhead ,  desperate ,  men chasing ,  "old-maid" wannabes is beyond me . <br /><br />their plots and dialog remind me of "the simpons" ,  homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not NOT_on NOT_screen ,  "everyone should ask ,  where's poochie?" .  all the talk centers on whining about some guy ,  and then whining to some guy .  sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead .  then they get back together or break up at the end .  the 2 women are either shallow ,  stupid ,  or sex addicts .  the only word i can think of is "sucks" . 
897 1 i think this movie is absolutely beautiful .  and i'm not NOT_referring NOT_only NOT_to NOT_the NOT_breathtaking NOT_scenery .  it's about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not NOT_so NOT_happy NOT_home NOT_lives .  in the end four women total rent the place together ,  all with different personalities and different reasons for being there .  in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions ,  more so than without .  i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding .  the acting is a joy to watch in itself .  i especially love the characters of lottie (josie lawrence) and lady caroline (polly walker) . 
898 0 i'll admit i've only watched a handful of episodes ,  but each one seemed completely different from the next .  it seems after the first season ,  the producers decided to completely retool the show ,  drop characters ,  introduce new ones ,  and rewrite the entire show dynamic . <br /><br />as you have probably surmised already ,  the show is about quirky ,  unpredictable teenager holly (amanda bynes) who moves in with her high strung sister valerie (jennie garth) in new york city .  decent enough premise: odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx . <br /><br />while i miss the sitcoms of yore ,  this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly ,  and it's sad because they have some decent talent . <br /><br />on top of everything ,  they insisted on changing the show (val was living with a cast regular bf one season ,  then he was suddenly gone ,  so she opens a bakery? what?) when things change that drastically ,  you get the feeling that even the *show* knows it's bad .  i mean ,  completely new sets ,  characters written off and new show regulars!<br /><br />on a side note (this is just nitpicking) ,  i know this is a television show and not NOT_real NOT_at NOT_all ,  but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace .  .  .  in manhattan! are you serious!? 
899 1 for anyone who's judged others at first meeting ,  here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character .  the grumpy old lady has a soft ,  thoughtful heart - and needs new friends .  the flighty ,  unsure ,  'ditsy' dame who makes inappropriate ,  uncomfortable comments - sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all .  the cold ,  prim ,  proper ,  neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute - given the right setting .  the perfect beauty - rich ,  sweet ,  partying ,  pursued by throngs - wants peace ,  quiet ,  and love without possessiveness .  <br /><br />by taking the time to look beyond the surface ,  you will find treasures in everyday life ,  from the least expected sources .  all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment . 
900 0 this show is painful to watch  .  .  . <br /><br />it is obvious that the creators had no NOT_clue NOT_what NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_this NOT_show ,  from the ever changing "jobs" ,  boyfriends ,  and cast .  it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something  .  .  .  but had no NOT_idea NOT_what ,  and came up with this crappy show .  they cast her as a teen ,  surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings ,  and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy .  soon ,  they realize that she needs a "clique" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers . <br /><br />how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me .  somehow ,  abc has now decided that it is a "family" show ,  and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on abc family . 
901 1 i'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world .  unfortunately the movie was rather short ,  unusually so for a period piece ,  and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect .  however ,  the excellent story makes up for it .  the four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds .  over the course of the movie ,  they realize their problems and begin fixing them .  they believe san salvatore ,  the castle they stay in ,  has an enchanting effect on people .  "it's a tub of love , " says lottie wilkins .  you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on them . <br /><br />all their problems and their solutions are plausible .  the actresses were great .  the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale .  all in all ,  a 10/10 movie for me . 
902 0 i don't NOT_care NOT_how NOT_many NOT_nominations NOT_this NOT_junk NOT_got NOT_for NOT_best NOT_this NOT_and NOT_that ,  this movie stunk .  i didn't NOT_know NOT_whether NOT_to NOT_turn NOT_off NOT_the NOT_set ,  or file a lawsuit with o . j . 's attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health .  i have seldom been this bored; to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie-goer across the planet .  the whole story was stupid ,  the acting was uninspired ,  the 'drama' was emotionless .  i am thankful i didn't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_pay NOT_for NOT_this NOT_unfulfilling NOT_experience . 
903 1 if anyone is wondering why no NOT_one NOT_makes NOT_movies NOT_like NOT_they NOT_used NOT_to ,  with conversation ,  character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new ,  better and different ,  those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing ,  directing ,  and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england .  other days ,  other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment ,  made in 1992 with alfred molina ,  joan plowright ,  polly walker ,  josie lawrence ,  jim broadbent ,  miranda richardson ,  and michael kitchens in the major roles .  under the brush stroke direction of mike newell ,  these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye .  reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century ,  this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character ,  and the viewer ,  too .  an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us . 
904 0 i watched this movie for a project on love .  please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character ,  and then re-read the lines he's saying .  my life cannot go on .  .  .  i accidentally cut off my own hand .  .  . my brother was close by .  obviously his fault .  and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone .  no NOT_closure ,  bad script ,  and doesn't NOT_have NOT_enough NOT_extension NOT_of NOT_minor NOT_characters .  save yourself ,  unless your up for a good laugh .  costumes were done appropriately ,  and extras did a fabulous job .  i'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make ,  but keep it more genre specific ,  i can't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_anyone NOT_i NOT_know ,  because it is not NOT_an NOT_intellectual NOT_movie .  it is not NOT_a NOT_chick NOT_flick .  it is not NOT_a NOT_strict NOT_romantic .  and i can't NOT_show NOT_kids NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sex NOT_and NOT_questions NOT_to NOT_follow .  all in all ,  just not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_flick .

"<br /><br />charles baudelaire <br /><br />based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim ,  "enachanted april" can be described in one sentence â– it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women ,  four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april .  it is the correct description but it will not NOT_prepare NOT_you NOT_for NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_"enchanted NOT_april" NOT_- NOT_an NOT_ultimate NOT_"feel NOT_good" NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_perfection NOT_of NOT_its NOT_genre .  lovely and sunny ,  tender and peaceful ,  kind and magical ,  it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever .  this is the movie that actually affected my life .  i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost ,  unhappy and very lonely ,  when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself .  it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible .  i had promised to myself then that no NOT_matter NOT_what ,  i would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and i would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness .  .  . i promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not NOT_alone . <br /><br />charming ,  enchanting ,  and heartwarming ,  "enchanted april" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love .  this little film is a diamond of highest quality . 
906 0 ok ,  first the good: cher's performance and the cinematography .  although i'm no NOT_cher NOT_fan ,  she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written .  the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance . <br /><br />the rest: a thin plotline ,  nicholas cage's performance ,  and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italian-american family from new york .  firstly ,  everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed .  i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_accent NOT_he NOT_was NOT_trying NOT_use .  i honestly don't ,  it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent i've ever heard .  it was quite surreal .  and it wasn't NOT_because NOT_i'm NOT_some NOT_stickler NOT_for NOT_accuracy ,  his voice just cloyed in my ears .  and i like nicholas cage in other performances .  secondly ,  and this is purely anecdotal ,  but i have many italian relations ,  friends and acquaintances in new york city ,  and frankly i've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided .  and that would be on a boring night at the house .  what a let down . 
907 1 i always tell people that "enchanted april" is an adult movie with no NOT_cussing ,  no NOT_sex ,  and no NOT_violence .  one might think of it as "the ultimate chick flick" ,  but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too .  don't NOT_invite NOT_the NOT_kids ,  though .  this movie is very low-key . <br /><br />seeing "enchanted april" is a very healing experience .  the sound track and gorgeous scenery ,  along with the ladies' gentle manners ,  bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-raphaelite painting . <br /><br />lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie ,  i will paraphrase a line i heard once on "saturday night live" and say that my two favorite movies are "the deer hunter" and "enchanted april" . 
908 0 generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs .  problem is nicholas cage ,  there is no NOT_chemistry NOT_between NOT_he NOT_and NOT_cher NOT_and NOT_they NOT_are NOT_the NOT_central NOT_love NOT_story .  cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cage's shifting accent and out of control body language .  cage simply never NOT_settles NOT_into NOT_his NOT_role .  he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story .  cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character .  cage keeps taking these roles ,  perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't NOT_lend NOT_itself NOT_to NOT_them ,  though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts .  he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self .

910 0 even thought i'm not NOT_the NOT_biggest NOT_of NOT_cher NOT_fans ,  this movie was her crowning achievement .  granted ,  there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage ,  memory loss (and) intellectual impairment ,  upon the screening such a film .  a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one-third of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds . <br /><br />cher plays someone very un-cher in this movie ,  a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family .  they're anti-american ,  pro-italian and always at each other in someway .  she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while ,  a nice mamma's boy man ,  and he asks her to marry him .  she says yes .  i loved her mom's questions: "do you love him loretta?" ,  "no . " ,  "good .  if you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can .  but you like him then?" ,  "oh yeah ,  he's a sweet man ma" .  when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother ,  he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years . <br /><br />this victory for human rights carries even greater significance ,  as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment .  in 1938 ,  italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti ,  saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs ,  easing the job of slitting their throats .  cerletti was inspired ,  and began experimenting with electroshock on humans ,  developing the first electroshock machine .  broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern . <br /><br />this was , in so many ways ,  an anti-american movie .  it's about love ,  to be sure ,  but it's also about infidelity ,  secrets ,  lonely people ,  and strange behavior brought on by american policies .  the characters ,  from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant ,  the aunt and uncle ,  her parents and their problems ,  the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters .  it's somewhat of a chick flick ,  as it's how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp .  it's a cinderella story in many ways ,  and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan .  .  . <br /><br />assuming free and fully informed consent ,  it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses .  but we might ask ourselves whether we ,  as fans of cinema ,  though in no NOT_way NOT_sworn NOT_to NOT_any NOT_hippocratic NOT_oath ,  should be offering it .

913 1 this is a lovely ,  spirit-restoring movie .  from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting ,  every choice was perfectly right! the quiet joy of this film doesn't NOT_stale NOT_after NOT_repeated NOT_viewings .  josie lawrence ,  miranda richardson ,  polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format .

915 1 this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i can't NOT_get NOT_it NOT_out NOT_of NOT_my NOT_head .  i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done ,  and these four are excellent in their endeavors .  some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we'd never NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_do NOT_it NOT_in NOT_real NOT_life .  i always learn something from the shows .  but if you like mystery ,  drama ,  comedy ,  and a little forensic work you'll love this show .  it reminds me of quincy ,  me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other .  they screw up a lot but they get the job done ,  and that's what counts . 
916 0 what is this crap? my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title .  .  .  i decided to watch it with her so she didn't NOT_get NOT_bored ,  and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality . <br /><br />first ,  the acting was terrible .  they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards .  the delivery is sub-par and very formulaic .  scene cuts were terrible .  .  it looks like they took it straight from the story board ,  if there was one . <br /><br />secondly ,  the jokes and stereotypes weren't NOT_original NOT_or NOT_well NOT_played NOT_at NOT_all- NOT_again ,  very formulaic .  i can't NOT_count NOT_the NOT_times NOT_i NOT_was NOT_able NOT_to NOT_predict NOT_the NOT_next NOT_joke .  i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly "subtle" sexual innuendos .  the cat ,  the beaver patch ,  hung wong? .  .  c'mon! just .  .  stay away from this movie .  it's not NOT_cute ,  it's not NOT_funny ,  it's not NOT_even NOT_stupid-funny .  it's just stupid-stupid .  it's like a pg kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo ,  vulgarity ,  and violence to bump the mpaa rating .  stay away . <br /><br />"would you like to ride my yacht?"<br /><br />"is that what they're calling it now?"<br /><br />"you could ride my ding . "<br /><br />"oh! i think i got blood on my stool!"<br /><br />badly played ,  sir . 
917 1 my wife ,  kate and i absolutely loved the series and can't NOT_wait NOT_for NOT_the NOT_next NOT_one NOT_(hopefully NOT_there NOT_is NOT_a NOT_sequel!) .  i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it ,  maybe because i am "old and grey" and still interested in life:-) .  if anyone has the full lyrics please send them . <br /><br />of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually .  it's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience .  the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show . <br /><br />this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated ,  on a par with some of our other favourites ,  "spooks" and "hustle" . 
918 0 i was looking for a cute ,  simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake . <br /><br />i can't NOT_write NOT_a NOT_single NOT_good NOT_thing NOT_about NOT_it .  first ,  the script is stupid and not NOT_funny NOT_at NOT_all ,  relying on tired ,  recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs .  in my book ,  that's not NOT_funny ,  that's pathetic . <br /><br />low budget 'effects' (if i can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography .  in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no NOT_money . <br /><br />acting .  .  .  i feel sorry for the actors .  are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this? (looking at their recent filmography ,  it would appear so . ) despite the outfits ,  pamela is showing her age and as a whole ,  they don't NOT_even NOT_come NOT_across NOT_as NOT_sexy ,  let alone funny . <br /><br />this movie is not NOT_even NOT_in NOT_the NOT_so-bad-it-is-funny NOT_category .  it's just bad ,  as if everybody involved was sick of it . <br /><br />avoid . 
919 1 this is the best series of its type i've seen all year .  i can't NOT_help NOT_thinking NOT_it's NOT_just NOT_my NOT_luck NOT_- NOT_a NOT_series NOT_i NOT_love NOT_gets NOT_6 NOT_episodes NOT_(and NOT_more NOT_next NOT_year) NOT_and NOT_the NOT_constant NOT_stream NOT_of NOT_cookie-cutter NOT_cop NOT_shows NOT_get NOT_never NOT_ending NOT_episodes . <br /><br />i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many .  the scripts are good ,  and the mix of characters superb ,  the acting is top flight ,  and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat .  the stories aren't NOT_all NOT_that NOT_memorable ,  but that's not NOT_the NOT_reason NOT_i NOT_watch NOT_shows NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one .  <br /><br />the theme song is a favourite ,  and we were disappointed to find it isn't NOT_available NOT_in NOT_any NOT_published NOT_edition .  great stuff ,  bbc- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal (aside from the young constable nobody's there as eye-lolly ,  and even if he is ,  he can still act!) . 
920 0 i was required to watch the movie for my work ,  so i didn't NOT_pay NOT_for NOT_it NOT_(on NOT_the NOT_contrary ,  i got paid) ,  but i still found the movie to suck far more than average .  the jokes were lame ,  the two lead actresses .  .  .  well ,  to use the "first wives club" division of women's ages in hollywood ,  they are no NOT_longer NOT_in NOT_their NOT_"hot NOT_chick" NOT_age NOT_but NOT_more NOT_in NOT_their NOT_"district NOT_attorney" NOT_age .  what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line ,  which pretty much completely plagiarized "beavis & butthead do america" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to "do his wife" ,  not NOT_realizing NOT_they're NOT_expected NOT_to NOT_assassinate NOT_her) .  all in all ,  a bland piece of crap . 
921 1 this is a wonderful new crime series ,  bringing together three old stalwarts of british television (denis waterman ,  james bolam and alun armstrong) as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases ,  under the leadership of younger ,  career-focused amanda redman .  the three quirky ,  irritable old cops make a brilliant team ,  applying twenty-year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then - sometimes with effect ,  at other times to the horror of their senior officers .  the three are portrayed sympathetically ,  warts and all .  there are splendid comic scenes ,  and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts . <br /><br />at the end of the first six-part series (we are promised a further series next year) each of the characters had developed .  widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death .  lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather .  and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication! while amanda redman has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career .  the story lines have been interesting ,  if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dna-testing .  but it is the interplay of four of britain's finest actors which has made the series unmissable . 
922 0 warning: avoid this super duper awful movie .  .  . if you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointed . <br /><br />pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing? trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy ,  just not NOT_working NOT_at NOT_all .  pam and denise act so horribly in this movie . <br /><br />plus the script is absolutely atrocious ,  i can't NOT_believe NOT_someone NOT_can NOT_came NOT_out NOT_with NOT_such NOT_crappy NOT_ideas .  with the development of movie industry ,  movie lovers are not NOT_as NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_satisfy NOT_as NOT_the NOT_ones NOT_in NOT_the NOT_last NOT_century .  i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too . <br /><br />stay away from it .  i think watch "white chicks" from 2004 it's so much better that this .  .  . make no NOT_mistake NOT_at NOT_that NOT_time NOT_i NOT_thought NOT_that's NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_movie NOT_i NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_seen . 
923 1 being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb . <br /><br />it's your basic 'who done it?' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end .  i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard . <br /><br />to me it was worth watching more than once so i'll give it an 8 on imdb . 
924 0 this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time .  awful acting ,  awful script .  .  .  and they were the good points! one to definitely miss! the jokes ,  if you could call them that ,  were so predictable as to be pathetic .  pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! i sat willing to give it a chance ,  hoping that it was going to improve which ,  alas ,  it didn't! if it was a choice between this and a book ,  i suggest you settle down for a good read! i like denise richards ,  which is why i gave this movie a go ,  but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me! 
925 1 "the luzhin defence" is ,  in the foreground ,  a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (turturro) who becomes consumed by the game and ,  in the background via flashbacks ,  his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become .  factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest (watson) and former "mentor" (wilson) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy's lake como and the intensity of high chess play .  an excellent film for those into period dramas ,  the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film . 
926 0 blonde and blonder was unfunny . basically ,  it was a rip-off girl version of dumb and dumber ,  but less funny ,  and they used too much background noises and music . way too much background noises and music if you ask me!!!!it starts out immensely boring ,  and totally inane . it doesn't NOT_pick NOT_up NOT_pace NOT_anywhere NOT_soon ,  and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on . maybe ,  the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes . i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end ,  but that was the only part . also ,  i couldn't help but like pamela anderson and denise richard's characters a little . even though this movie didn't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_laughs NOT_from NOT_me ,  it kept my attention . i wouldn't NOT_say NOT_to NOT_completely NOT_avoid NOT_this NOT_movie ,  but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder . 
927 1 of course the plot ,  script ,  and ,  especially casting are strong in the film .  so many fine things to see .  one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--luzhini's (turturro's)--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines .  his chess opponent--an italian dandy in three piece and cane--turns out to be a real gent ,  and a truly fine chess player .  to his credit the "opponent" nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously (luzhin has taken a flyer out a window--sad ,  but so releasing to him)by way of the unstable genius' widow (emily watson . ) in death ,  then ,  because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master ,  luzhin's defence (which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity) is allowed to be played .  the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant .  talk about a dramatic "end game!" 
928 0 this movie is not NOT_in NOT_anyway NOT_funny ,  it tries to be funny with it's lame humor ,  which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture .  throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing ,  "when is this gonna end" .  one thing you have to hand to them ,  is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments ,  which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars .  it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book ,  even the ones that wasn't NOT_funny NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time .  it basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes . <br /><br />to sum it all up ,  this movie is blonde humor gone bad ,  it is not NOT_worth NOT_paying NOT_any NOT_amount NOT_of NOT_money NOT_to NOT_watch ,  it is just that bad . 
929 1 i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves ,  then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie .  now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering .  her eyes are the mirror to his soul --and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are . <br /><br />those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating .  romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded . 
930 0 when i was at the movie store the other day ,  i passed up blonde and blonder ,  but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie .  who knows? i mean ,  i'm sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it ,  blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up .  but when i started watching it: executive producer pamela anderson ,  wow ,  i knew i was in for something scary .  not NOT_only NOT_that ,  but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: pam anderson and denise richards ,  not NOT_to NOT_offend NOT_them ,  but they were not NOT_aging NOT_well NOT_at NOT_all NOT_and NOT_they're NOT_playing NOT_roles NOT_that NOT_i NOT_think NOT_were NOT_more NOT_meant NOT_for NOT_women NOT_who NOT_are NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_in NOT_their NOT_20's ,  not NOT_their NOT_40's .  the story was just plain bad and obnoxious . <br /><br />dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's ,  they really don't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_clue NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_to NOT_what NOT_is NOT_going NOT_on NOT_in NOT_the NOT_world ,  it's just really sad .  but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins ,  the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their "ignorance is bliss" attitudes .  they are set up to make a "hit" on a guy ,  and they think they're just going to "show him a good time" ,  but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls . <br /><br />denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before .  i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy ,  but it was more than stupid ,  it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary .  would i ever recommend this? not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_million NOT_years ,  the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens" ,  it's more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell . <br /><br />1/10 
931 1 marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors .  this sensitive ,  visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony .  john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance (i am usually not NOT_a NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_his); NOT_and NOT_emily NOT_watson NOT_is NOT_brilliant NOT_as NOT_well .  well worth seeing . 
932 0 how could i best express my feelings about this movie: hideous? a headache? lack of coherent writing? plain stupidity? try all of the above for this travesty .  and that just for the direction . <br /><br />story? well i guess there is a story .  two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course .  they are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' (sarcasm) and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters' .  one thinks "taking him out" means a date ,  and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of .  and of course ,  the turtle reserve for the farting turtle ,  that they build with the casino winnings . <br /><br />sounds likes all this could be funny? guess again .  they try to make it funny ,  but its not .  filming sequences aren't NOT_well NOT_done .  i've seen better filming in hong kong movies .  visuals are average for a late 80s film .  but the problem is that its a 2007 movie . <br /><br />not worth my time to ever watch this again .  it still doesn't NOT_beat NOT_danny NOT_glover's NOT_"out" NOT_movie NOT_from NOT_the NOT_early NOT_80s NOT_as NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_movie NOT_of NOT_all NOT_time ,  but then again that film is in a class of its own .  "f" 
933 1 this was an exteremely good historical drama .  john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affectations such as his strange dancing .  emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover natalia . <br /><br />the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as 'eternal innocence' (i . e .  'lolita') are evident in this film .  i think i will now go on to read the novel .  it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye .  brilliant movie! 
934 0 there are bad movies ,  terrible movies even boring movies .  .  . i can watch most and put up until the end ,  not NOT_this NOT_time .  avoid this like the plague ,  annoying music throughout ,  terrible editing ,  no NOT_comedy ,  its tackier than a novelty mug .  .  . my missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable ,  but never NOT_better NOT_than NOT_average ,  chick flick .  its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button . <br /><br />the girls ,  well ,  they were not NOT_great NOT_to NOT_start NOT_with NOT_(denise NOT_done NOT_ok NOT_in NOT_starship NOT_troopers NOT_and NOT_wild NOT_things) NOT_but NOT_you NOT_have NOT_sank NOT_to NOT_the NOT_gravel .  i feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this .  .  . pamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face . <br /><br />please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen . 
935 1 this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best .  the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant .  <br /><br />the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson .  turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought .  watson also performs brilliantly . <br /><br />the story is about a phenomenal chess player (turturro) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life .  the film is presented in a non linear time ,  with multiple flashbacks of luzhin's childhood .  through those ,  the complex character of luzhin is described .  <br /><br />i have nothing more to say ,  but to suggest this film to anyone . 
936 0 before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube ,  i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980: barbara bach's cleavage .  and since the movie received an r rating ,  i expected to see her nude .  alas ,  no NOT_dice NOT_for NOT_her NOT_or NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_gorgeous NOT_actress NOT_that NOT_appeared NOT_here: NOT_stacey NOT_nelkin NOT_who's NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_teen NOT_but NOT_was NOT_actually NOT_20 NOT_when NOT_she NOT_made NOT_this .  seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms .  bach .  they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides .  in fact ,  i don't NOT_blame NOT_ron NOT_leibman NOT_for NOT_having NOT_his NOT_name NOT_removed NOT_from NOT_the NOT_credits NOT_since NOT_his NOT_role NOT_as NOT_the NOT_tight-fisted NOT_liceman NOT_is NOT_pretty NOT_embarrassing NOT_though NOT_i NOT_did NOT_like NOT_the NOT_"seduction" NOT_scene NOT_he NOT_did NOT_with NOT_ms .  nelkin .  this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio who's the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school .  the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms .  bach ,  an arab who worships motor oil ,  and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend candy (nelkin's character) so much ,  he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy .  among the supporting cast ,  tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing .  with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr .  (whose son robert downey jr .  has a cameo early on in a soccer scene) ,  up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you're really offended at the scatological and sexual content ,  this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boy-alfred e .  newman-shouldn't be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture .  .  . p . s .  another one of the "misfits" was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago ,  ill .  he played rodney ververgaert .  he also says one of my favorite lines: "i'm trying to come .

937 1 the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice .  the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander ,  an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction .  nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted .  she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket .  a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day ,  the mother alarmed telegrams the husband .  he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ,  ala' godfather ii ,  where we see young alexander ,  a child prodigy .  he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums .  thinking alexander reached his peak ,  abandons him but becomes legend .  the old teacher returns causing harm ,  trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander .  in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality ,  the chess clock ticks ,  match time ends to conclude the next day .  that day is nastasya's wedding ,  the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown .  nastasya ,  holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves .  though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots ,  its low back cut dresses are lovely ,  alexander plays his role sublimely . the director underestimated her audience ,  we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens ,  isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws & king ,  sacrificing the castle for mate .  nastasya is a great match ,  but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity ,  but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her .  the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor ,  the complexity of his work in images is a world event not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_missed .

939 1 the story-line was rather interesting ,  but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior .  more extreme than necessary .  also ,  i think something went wrong in the casting .  john turtorro doesn't NOT_really NOT_satisfy NOT_me NOT_playing NOT_a NOT_semi-autistic NOT_chess NOT_player ,  not NOT_to NOT_speak NOT_of NOT_the NOT_italian NOT_player .  motives weren't NOT_very NOT_much NOT_outlined NOT_either . <br /><br /> 
940 0 i used to love this movie as a kid but ,  seeing it again 20+ years later ,  it actually sucks .  up the academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980 ,  but it has almost nothing to offer today! movies like caddyshack and stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile .  no NOT_t&a .  no NOT_great NOT_jokes NOT_except NOT_for NOT_the NOT_one-liners NOT_we've NOT_all NOT_heard NOT_a NOT_million NOT_times NOT_by NOT_now . <br /><br />i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being .  well ,  i was way off! the soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible .  the only thing that was interesting ,  to me ,  was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them .  yep ,  i watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten ,  sorry to say .  :( 
941 1 as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma ,  i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma ,  even a trauma .  it not NOT_only NOT_explains NOT_the NOT_enormous NOT_difficulties NOT_those NOT_people NOT_have NOT_to NOT_cope NOT_wither ,  but that even love is sometimes not NOT_enough .  but she tries! 
942 0 a stale "misfits-in-the-army" saga ,  which half-heartedly attempts to be both surreal (the foreign subtitles) and vulgar (the flatulence gags) ,  but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor ,  none of them followed very successfully .  barbara bach ,  the bond girl from "the spy who loved me" ,  has only two or three brief scenes .  what a waste! (*1/2) 
943 1 this movie stars emily watson ,  of breaking the waves fame .  this movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held .  a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman ,  played by emily watson .  she falls for this oddball of a man ,  who is obsessed with chess .  this is all at the dismay of her mother ,  who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a proper gentleman .  her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman ,  as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such .  what ensues is mostly a journey through the man's psyche .  it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present .  emily watson is amazing in this ,  as well as the actor who plays the main character .  it is definitely slow ,  but is well worth the watching .  the ending was even satisfying .  :) 
944 0 the only thing i remember about this movie are two things: first ,  as a twelve year old ,  even i thought it stunk .  second ,  it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it ,  they quit after the first page ,  and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it . <br /><br />if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period ,  try animal house .  it's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art .  another good selection would be caddyshack ,  the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming ,  with great lines like greens keeper carl spackler's "correct me if i'm wrong sandy ,  but if i kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key . " 
945 1 this movie was well done in all respects .  the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving .  it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods "white hunter , black heart" .  this movie is simply the best . <br /><br />cheers zuf 
946 0 that's what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it .  he wasn't NOT_able NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_from NOT_dozing NOT_off .  i had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally i relented and played it ,  having run out of adjectives for "boring" .  <br /><br />imagine if you will ,  the pinnacle of hack-work .  something so uninspired ,  so impossibly dreadful ,  that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not NOT_speak NOT_to NOT_anybody .  some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable .  it is not ,  not NOT_under NOT_any NOT_form NOT_of NOT_narcotic NOT_or NOT_brain NOT_damage .  i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is .  don't NOT_believe NOT_me? NOT_gather NOT_'round .  <br /><br />granted ,  as a nation ,  we in america don't NOT_always NOT_portray NOT_middle NOT_eastern NOT_peoples NOT_in NOT_a NOT_tasteful NOT_manner .  but how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam-fashion to a stack of castrol motor oil bottles? you'll find that here .  get it? the arab worships oil .  i couldn't believe what i was seeing .  having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would've been more appropriate .  who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke? it's not NOT_even NOT_close NOT_to NOT_"cleverly NOT_offensive" .  it just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face .  <br /><br />in the middle of the film ,  a five-man singing group called the "landmines" takes the stage at an officers' ball .  okay- are you ready? the joke is they sing terribly and off-key .  why did i write that in caps also? because the joke is pound ,  pound ,  pounded into your head with a marathon of horrendous sight gags .  they start off mediocre enough; glasses cracking ,  punch tumblers shattering .  .  .  then there is ,  i am 100% serious ,  a two-frame stop-motion sequence of a woman's shoes coming off .  you read that correctly- the music was so bad ,  in one frame ,  the woman's feet have shoes on .  in the very next- the shoes are off!!! get it ,  because the music was so bad ,  her shoes came off! what the f???? <br /><br />then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad .  if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell ,  i would be astonished .  this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors .  robert downey sr .  directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug-free .  badly .  other things to watch out for:<br /><br />1 .  the popular music shoehorned in wherever possible .  every time liceman appears ,  a really inappropriate iggy pop song plays .  plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason . <br /><br />2 .  barbara bach's criminally awful accent .  she sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue .  there is no NOT_nudity ,  and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage ,  like they're in a community school acting class and they've been directed to act like aroused retarded people .  <br /><br />3 .  liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom .  remember; when this movie came out throwing in "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "edgy" .  <br /><br />4 .  tom poston plays a mincing ,  boy-hungry pedophile ,  back when hollywood thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one in the same .  flat-out embarrassing .  <br /><br />5 .  watch the ending .  nothing is wrong with your vcr .  that is actually the ending .  tell me that doesn't NOT_make NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_explode NOT_everyone NOT_who's NOT_ever NOT_made NOT_any NOT_movie ,  ever .  <br /><br />watch this at your own risk .  up the academy has been known to actually make other movies ,  like the jerk or blazing saddles ,  less funny simply by placing the videotape near them . 
947 1 don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_this NOT_missed NOT_award NOT_nominations .  great film .  certainly of the calibre of "beautiful mind" great acting ,  photography ,  script and drama .  i can't NOT_imagine NOT_anyone NOT_not NOT_being NOT_entranced NOT_by NOT_this NOT_film . 
948 0 i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal ,  in fact ,  it probably is still brutal today ,  but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly "made-for-tv" movie? also ,  women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time ,  so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory ,  and still show the realism of the era â… would it make for good viewing? honestly ,  i don't NOT_know .  i have thought about this film for the past two days ,  and i still can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_muster NOT_the NOT_strength NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_horrible NOT_film ,  yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn't NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_i NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_seen .  from several hodgepodge styles of acting ,  to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character ,  to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema ,  it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland .  was it good? was it bad? that may be up for you to view and decide yourself ,  but until then ,  here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated! <br /><br />this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes .  scenes where i wasn't NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_the NOT_director NOT_was NOT_doing NOT_or NOT_which NOT_direction NOT_he NOT_was NOT_headed ,  but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole .  i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting ,  historical tale .  i do not NOT_know NOT_much NOT_about NOT_living NOT_in NOT_wyoming ,  especially during the early 1900s ,  so this film captured that image in my mind .  the thought of very cold winters ,  no NOT_neighbors NOT_for NOT_miles NOT_upon NOT_miles ,  and this polaroid-esquire view untouched by corporate america .  it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience (though the television) .  there were scenes that really stood out in my mind ,  like the cattle-branding scene ,  the pig slaughtering scene ,  and the saddening homesteader that didn't NOT_survive NOT_their NOT_journey ,  that just brought a true sense of realism to this story .  director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers ,  but i am not NOT_sure NOT_he NOT_brought NOT_decent NOT_players NOT_to NOT_accompany NOT_the NOT_view . <br /><br />while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film ,  i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side .  rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart ,  a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell's elinore randall .  the two as actors have no NOT_chemistry NOT_at NOT_all .  their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion .  the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two "veteran" actors portrayed it .  the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her ,  while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done .  this is love? was it supposed to be love? i don't NOT_know ,  i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond ,  but with torn and ferrell ,  it felt like two actors just playing their parts .  other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse "knocks" on the door for food or shelter ,  the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore's daughter (i just didn't NOT_believe NOT_it) ,  the lack of true winter struggle ,  and the entire land scene .  the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing ,  why she was doing it ,  and why clyde would build her a house if they were married! it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore ,  would have made for a stronger film . <br /><br />overall ,  i will go middle of the road with this feature .  there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper ,  such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore ,  but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation .  these panoramic scenes which ,  in the span of 100 years ,  have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers .  while there were some brilliant scenes of realism (starring cattle and pigs) ,  i just felt as if we needed more .  depth was a key element lacking in this film ,  which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story .  pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world ,  but instead left open loopholes and clichã©d western characters .  ferrell carried her own ,  but torn was completely miscast .  decent for a viewing ,  but will not NOT_be NOT_picked NOT_up NOT_again NOT_by NOT_me . <br /><br />grade: ** out of ***** 
949 1 not NOT_having NOT_read NOT_nabokov ,  and knowing nothing about chess ,  i could only view "the luzhin defence" as a movie .  <br /><br />it works really well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances . " the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in ,  say "searching for bobby fischer , " in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be ,  requiring thought ,  preparation ,  stamina and planning .  i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated . <br /><br />through the feminist director maureen gorris (of "antonia") ,  emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius . <br /><br />the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful . <br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001) 
950 0 one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen .  i wanted to vomit after watching it .  i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800's .  what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered ,  human birth ,  branding .  oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't NOT_too NOT_bad ,  but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom .  the story itself was ok .  the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy .  they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800's .  but if you have a choice ,  do not NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie . 
951 1 once again proving his amazing versatility ,  john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament ,  and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident (emily watson) at a 1920's italian hotel .  they fall in love , to the horror of her social-mountaineering mother (geraldine james) . a wonderful love story ,  whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral . but in spite of its origins in a nabakov story ,  it certainly is not NOT_ . the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down . john turturro ,  having appeared in "barton fink"  , "o brother , where art thou?" "the big lebowski" proves that he is not NOT_dependant NOT_on NOT_coen NOT_bros NOT_films NOT_to NOT_assert NOT_his NOT_stature . 
952 0 when converting a book to film ,  it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts ,  rather than ignoring the author altogether .  while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart's children ,  it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good ,  enriching ,  strengthening experiences of homesteading her land .  the book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances ,  though they lived dozens of miles apart .  the film ,  however ,  takes a standard stance for the time it was made ,  portraying this woman's experience as harsh ,  unforgiving ,  and nearly pointless .  perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie (as some film aficionados have said) ,  but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak ,  odious landscape devoid of friends or hope .  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_with NOT_this NOT_movie; NOT_read NOT_the NOT_book NOT_instead . 
953 1 a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there .  on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story .  so ,  there is more .  there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player . <br /><br />this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely .  it's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film .  the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting . <br /><br />i have no NOT_idea NOT_of NOT_the NOT_strength NOT_of NOT_the NOT_chess NOT_players NOT_as NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_play NOT_the NOT_game NOT_myself NOT_but NOT_it NOT_looks NOT_nice NOT_and NOT_believable .  all in all ,  most of the film goes down very easily .  it is also forgotten again very easily though .  so it's nice to watch but nothing more than that . <br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place 
954 0 i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay ,  warner bros .  retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract . <br /><br />she decided to take the money .  but her career suffered accordingly . <br /><br />that might explain what she was doing in "comet over broadway . " (though it doesn't NOT_explain NOT_why NOT_donald NOT_crisp NOT_and NOT_ian NOT_hunter NOT_are NOT_in NOT_it ,  too . ) "ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film ,  and that's right on target .  the murder trial .  her seedy vaudeville career .  her success in london .  her final scene with her daughter .  no NOT_part NOT_logically NOT_leads NOT_to NOT_the NOT_next NOT_part . <br /><br />also ,  the sets and costumes looked like b-movie stuff .  and her hair! turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month .  watch any other one and you'll be doing yourself a favor . 
955 1 hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 .  i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess ,  but hopefully not NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_the NOT_central NOT_character NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film . <br /><br />in this film ,  the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 .  he is famous for a game he played against steinitz ,  where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz .  instead of resigning ,  he simply walked out of the tournament hall ,  never NOT_to NOT_return . <br /><br />the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments .  chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice ,  and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life .  a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer .  although a genius ,  he was also very disturbed in many ways . <br /><br />in the film ,  a world championship match is depicted ,  as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin .  the format is a knockout ,  which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final .  but this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format ,  where the winners of each group play against each other . <br /><br />the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself .  in fact ,  i have done a youtube video about it ,  for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk . youtube . com/watch?v=xzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon 
956 0 the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff .  i've only seen perhaps eight of them ,  but comet over broadway is the worst so far .  the very best thing about it is that it's short .  oh ,  and the orry-kelly gowns (of course) are fine .  james wong howe's cinematography is not .  kay francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does .  minna gombell whom i don't NOT_know NOT_otherwise NOT_is NOT_good NOT_as NOT_a NOT_semi-tough NOT_"burlesque" NOT_dancer NOT_(it NOT_looked NOT_more NOT_like NOT_a NOT_fashion NOT_show NOT_than NOT_burlesque) .  the closing shot - kay francis and her child (when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother? did i doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous .  the whole film is so cheap ,  so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't NOT_know ,  in warner bros' cynical estimation of them ,  that what they're getting is garbage . 
957 1 i'm rather surprised that no NOT_reviewer NOT_so NOT_far NOT_has NOT_commented NOT_on NOT_the NOT_rather NOT_elementary NOT_chess NOT_blunder NOT_in NOT_luzhin's NOT_game NOT_as NOT_white NOT_against NOT_an NOT_unnamed NOT_opponent NOT_immediately NOT_before NOT_the NOT_final .  despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert ,  luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move .  in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_spot NOT_that NOT_after NOT_luzhin's NOT_combination NOT_culminating NOT_in NOT_a NOT_queen NOT_sacrifice ,  his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1 .  thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience . 
958 0 wow ,  the plot for this film is all over the place! there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! and ,  as a result ,  none of it seemed particularly believable . <br /><br />the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town .  she's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway .  when a big-time actor arrives in town ,  she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost .  but ,  her husband is worried about shenanigans--as this actor is a cad .  so ,  the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor--and the actor dies! as a result ,  he's convicted of first degree murder!!! not NOT_manslaughter ,  but murder 1! now ,  pregnant and in need of funds ,  kay goes to new york .  but broadway jobs aren't NOT_to NOT_be NOT_found ,  so she's forced to take any job--even burlesque .  unable to adequately care for her young daughter ,  she gives it to another woman to raise .  however ,  eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy .  but ,  the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play .  despondent ,  she makes her way to england and becomes a real star .  years later ,  she returns to new york to get her kid--but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother .  at the same time ,  her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $10 , 000 he can get the man out of prison .  as another reviewer wrote ,  is this to bribe people?! how can $10 , 000 get him out otherwise--maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! wow--this is enough for 2 or 3 films! and ,  all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! believe it or not ,  there's quite a bit more to it .  if you really care ,  see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds . <br /><br />this is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping ,  somehow ,  it will all work .  unfortunately ,  the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms .  francis' best efforts .  it's the sort of film no NOT_one NOT_could NOT_really NOT_have NOT_saved NOT_thanks NOT_to NOT_a NOT_2nd-rate NOT_plot .  it's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements ,  threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! overall ,  unless you are a die-hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s ,  this one is one you can easily skip .  not NOT_terrible NOT_but NOT_certainly NOT_not NOT_good . <br /><br />by the way ,  the child who plays francis' daughter upon her return to new york (sybil jason) really was terrible .  i think she was supposed to be .  .  . i think . 
959 1 emily watson's natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen .  she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt .  or ,  is she transmuted to the king? the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control ,  power ,  and victory is stunning .  just as the chess masters in the film do ,  the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once ,  but all weave into either major or minor patterns .  the period ,  the costumes ,  and imagery of early 20th century italy's lake district is captured magnificently .  not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_square NOT_of NOT_space NOT_is NOT_wasted . <br /><br />so many brilliant scenes abound ,  i cannot recount them all .  i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice ,  possibly a week apart ,  because you can't NOT_possibly NOT_capture NOT_all NOT_the NOT_poetry NOT_within NOT_a NOT_64-square NOT_yet NOT_multi-dimensional NOT_framework NOT_in NOT_one NOT_setting .  <br /><br />i did not NOT_read NOT_nabakov's NOT_book ,  but to try an analogy of my own ,  what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie ,  barry levinson's the natural .  it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american .  well ,  the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment .  the true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser ,  unless both contestants draw .  but ,  in life ,  and especially in the context of our immortal souls ,  we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit .  <br /><br />pure love ,  as personified by emily watson's natalia ,  can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously .  only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it . <br /><br />this is a magnificent movie (10/10) . 
960 0 2 stars for kay francis -- she's wonderful! and she didn't NOT_deserve NOT_this NOT_horrible NOT_tripe NOT_that NOT_warner NOT_bros .  threw her way! <br /><br />the two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme .  kay is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress .  when a big-shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities ,  kay tells her husband she's going to the movies .  the hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that kay's not NOT_being NOT_truthful ,  and he sets out looking for her .  he finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy ,  who falls over a railing ,  lands face-first in a pond (lake?) ,  and dies .  now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based: <br /><br />1) the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water ,  that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder .  (whaaaaa?????? i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most ,  not NOT_first NOT_degree NOT_murder .  give me a break! but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life .  whatever . ) <br /><br />2) the hubby's lawyer ,  after the conviction and sentencing ,  tells kay that it's all her fault .  his reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room ,  then her husband wouldn't NOT_have NOT_had NOT_to NOT_go NOT_after NOT_her NOT_and NOT_slug NOT_the NOT_guy NOT_and NOT_kill NOT_him .  he tells her that she's the guilty one ,  not NOT_her NOT_husband ,  and she nods and agrees .  what .  the .  hell?!?!?! the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place . <br /><br />i can't NOT_even NOT_go NOT_on NOT_with NOT_this NOT_review .  the movie was just all too painful .  four years earlier ,  in the pre-code days ,  you'd never NOT_have NOT_caught NOT_kay NOT_playing NOT_such NOT_a NOT_wimp! NOT_in NOT_true NOT_kay NOT_francis NOT_fashion ,  though ,  she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character .  i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role .  this character was a far cry from pre-code kay roles and real-life spitfire kay francis . <br /><br />steer way clear of this one! there are much better kay francis vehicles out there! (from personal experience ,  i can highly recommend mary stevens ,  md and jewel robbery; also good are dr .  monica and one way passage .  i'm sure there's other great kay flicks as well ,  but i'm only mentioning the ones i've seen and can recommend . ) 
961 1 the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game .  so many people have seen this film and just don't NOT_get NOT_it ,  and i don't NOT_understand NOT_why .  while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me .  i will try to explain this without any spoilers ,  but be forewarned ,  i do talk about things that happen in the movie . <br /><br />**** possible spoilers **** be forewarned!****<br /><br />his is a life of "large moves" versus "small moves" .  he chooses natalia to be his queen ,  and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy .  listen closely to that description . <br /><br />when someone asks him a question ,  he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves .  (the flashbacks are beautifully lit ,  by the way . ) the flashbacks are quite interesting as well ,  for they give not NOT_only NOT_his NOT_point NOT_of NOT_view NOT_as NOT_a NOT_child ,  but the point of view of the other character as well .  it's stunning . <br /><br />various characters become either his helpers or his enemies ,  pawns ,  bishops and knights ,  their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on .  even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on .  beautifully done . <br /><br />i will not NOT_comment NOT_more NOT_on NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_the NOT_character NOT_of NOT_luhzin ,  but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end . <br /><br />this film is constantly working on many levels ,  which is why i endorse it .  it was a treat and a joy to watch . <br /><br />if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh .  the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces . <br /><br /> 
962 0 any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't NOT_bother NOT_with NOT_an NOT_actual NOT_story ,  it's annoying .  those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first ,  and the story simply tacked on .  for this reason we often talk of the story "jumping through hoops" as it twists about ,  trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion . <br /><br />the story in "comet over broadway" doesn't NOT_just NOT_jump NOT_through NOT_hoops ,  it's a three ring circus .  it's so ludicrous ,  so ill-conceived ,  so disingenuous that ,  if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen ,  you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through . <br /><br />the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession .  since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion .  so ,  in the end there's no NOT_point NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story ,  the theme becomes irrelevant and ,  as is often the case with poor screenplays ,  the acting doesn't NOT_save NOT_a NOT_thing . 
963 1 this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great .  maybe this is because gorris' takes nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation .  the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov's one . <br /><br />the only thing in the movie which i don't NOT_like NOT_is NOT_the NOT_influence NOT_of NOT_valentinov's NOT_on NOT_luzhin's NOT_destiny .  i can't NOT_imagine NOT_nabokov NOT_creating NOT_a NOT_person NOT_like NOT_valentinov NOT_and NOT_giving NOT_him NOT_so NOT_great NOT_influence NOT_on NOT_novel's NOT_argument . 
964 0 it figures this is a french film ,  lol ,  with the emphasis on young girls with much older men .  .  . why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing? when the age difference is this great ,  it really comes off as pervy! valentina cervi is beautiful (she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey ,  of zeffirelli's '68 romeo and juliet ,  set in a similar period) ,  but she looks about 15 and the actor playing tassi ,  her painting instructor ,  looks .  .  . well ,  50 is kind . <br /><br />other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record (unusually detailed in this case) of the real artemisia ,  a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period (17th century) .  her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men" -- she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits -- and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant .  not NOT_only NOT_was NOT_she NOT_clearly NOT_assaulted ,  and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame) ,  but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child . <br /><br />the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story -- very dramatic and not NOT_in NOT_need NOT_of NOT_any NOT_"spicing NOT_up" NOT_-- NOT_because NOT_in NOT_some NOT_weird NOT_frencified NOT_way ,  it's "hotter" to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather .  that's "sexy" -- the truth is boring and seems too feminist/politically correct . <br /><br />it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film .  the fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after ,  not NOT_before NOT_the NOT_rape) ,  that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy ,  that she went on to have children .  .  . oh that's boring stuff .  after all ,  that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't NOT_"hot" NOT_like NOT_teenagers . <br /><br />i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film (or a book) about a real historical character .  you need to create dialog ,  have subplots ,  create dramatic structure .  certainly some details can be sacrificed -- it's no NOT_big NOT_deal NOT_if NOT_the NOT_dates NOT_are NOT_moved NOT_a NOT_few NOT_years ,  or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette .  .  . and a big boned one ,  not NOT_a NOT_skinny NOT_minny) ,  or something like that .  but to turn her story around on her ,  and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing .  it's even worse because the director is female .  she should be horribly ashamed of herself!<br /><br />if you like this (and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex) ,  you will probably like "dangerous beauty" with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack .  similarly based on heavily re-written history ,  with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets: bon appetit! 
965 1 this is a poem on film ,  wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry .  it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly .  (italy's lake district in the twenties . ) it's a love story with a twist .  the characters are unique and believable .  the settings are deliciously exotic .  some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images .  and rather than the mandatory happy ending ,  this story has a bitter sweet one .  if film is an art ,  this is close to a masterpiece . <br /><br /> 
966 0 i didn't NOT_think NOT_the NOT_french NOT_could NOT_make NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie ,  but i was ,  clearly ,  very wrong .  as has been said before ,  this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi .  <br /><br />the script is awful -- pretentious ,  stilted ,  and vapid -- and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting ,  rather than retelling ,  history .  along with some fairly decent set design ,  valentina cervi's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie ,  and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no NOT_time NOT_in NOT_contriving NOT_various NOT_"erotic" NOT_sequences NOT_which NOT_have NOT_far NOT_more NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_titillation NOT_than NOT_with NOT_plot NOT_or NOT_character NOT_development .  unfortunately ,  the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot ,  and does not ,  sustain this movie .  the acting is unremarkable ,  and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two .  the cinematography is ok ,  and there are some pretty colors ,  but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted-lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama .  in any event ,  the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia's body ,  and all too seldom on her paintings . <br /><br />all told ,  a near-complete failure .  it's not NOT_intelligent NOT_or NOT_tasteful NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_film ,  and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography .  so the french can fail ,  after all! 
967 1 very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years  , but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it , john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man  , nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces  , the game validates him as a person  , when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion , even the love of a woman was not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_save NOT_him NOT_from NOT_his NOT_sad NOT_existence . it makes you wonder if there other luzon's out there who obsess about the game , i am sure they are , if you are a chess enthusiast it won't NOT_hurt NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_it . its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well , it achieves its objectives , unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel . 
968 0 i was disgusted by this movie .  no NOT_it NOT_wasn't NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_graphic NOT_sex NOT_scenes ,  it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi .  this movie does not NOT_hold NOT_much NOT_truth NOT_about NOT_her NOT_and NOT_her NOT_art .  it shows one piece of art work that she did (judith beheading holofernese) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not NOT_paint NOT_her NOT_first NOT_judith NOT_for NOT_a NOT_year NOT_after NOT_the NOT_trial . <br /><br />i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_you NOT_understood NOT_this NOT_from NOT_the NOT_movie ,  probably not ,  tassi was not NOT_a NOT_noble NOT_character .  he raped artemisia .  it was not NOT_love ,  it was rape .  he did not NOT_claim NOT_to NOT_accept NOT_false NOT_charges NOT_of NOT_rape NOT_to NOT_stop NOT_her NOT_from NOT_suffering NOT_while NOT_she NOT_was NOT_tortured .  according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never NOT_carnally NOT_knew NOT_artemisia NOT_(aka NOT_had NOT_sex NOT_with) NOT_while NOT_she NOT_states NOT_over NOT_and NOT_over NOT_again NOT_"it's NOT_true" . <br /><br />i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about .  don't NOT_base NOT_all NOT_of NOT_your NOT_knowledge NOT_on NOT_this NOT_fictional NOT_movie .  i encourage you to do some research ,  artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work . <br /><br />don't see the movie ,  but find out the true story of artemisia . 
969 1 alexandr "sascha" luzhin (john turturro) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy-hosted tournament .  his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life .  natalia (emily watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother ,  vera (geraldine james) to scope out possible marriage partners .  vera leans toward a handsome count but ,  astonishingly ,  natalia is more fascinated by sascha ,  whom she met on a walk .  sascha ,  too ,  is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting .  but ,  with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and ,  with other happenings in his past still causing problems ,  will he win the heart of natalia? oh ,  and can he become the chess champion ,  also? this is a lovely film ,  based on a novel by nabokov .  the acting is amazing ,  with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy ,  awkward chess enthusiast .  james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well .  as for the look of the film ,  it could not NOT_be NOT_better .  the scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety ,  the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause .  yes ,  the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks ,  at times ,  making it a film not NOT_everyone NOT_will NOT_appreciate .  then ,  too ,  the ending is bittersweet .  however ,  if you love romance ,  period pieces ,  great acting ,  knockout scenery ,  or the fine art of motion picture creation ,  don't NOT_miss NOT_this NOT_one .  you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms . 
970 0 when i saw the preview ,  i thought: this is going to be a great movie .  and indeed it could have been .  the actress playing the main character was very credible ,  and the beauty of the filming is undeniable .  however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture .  the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 ,  and it took away most of the magic of the film .  however ,  i must congratulate the translator ,  because the english sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues ,  and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd! 
971 1 'the luzhin defence' is a good film with fine central performances ,  but too much of the novel and not NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_the NOT_filmmaker's NOT_craft NOT_shines NOT_through .  it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along .  marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin ,  rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others . <br /><br />adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task ,  especially a novel written in the early 20th century .  this film does not NOT_go NOT_deeply NOT_enough NOT_into NOT_the NOT_relationship NOT_between NOT_luzhin NOT_and NOT_natalia .  natalia's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film .  i felt that i was put through luzhin's torment and eventual tragic end ,  without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled .  however ,  this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_one . 
972 0 this flick was a blow to me .  i guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models ,  home makers or mistresses ,  since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway .  it is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated .  inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected) ,  artemisia's entire character and all that she stands for ,  had been reduced to a standard hollywood ,  female character; a pitiful ,  physically flawless ,  helpless little creature ,  displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here .  sadder yet ,  was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film ,  and reality .  to portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist ,  someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture ,  just plain pisses me off .  if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person . 
973 1 'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time .  it is a brooding ,  intense film ,  and kept my attention the entire time .  john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender ,  eccentric chess grandmaster ,  and emily watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family .  the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story .  all in all ,  this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster ,  and turturro and watson add a whole non-mainstream ,  non-cliche feel to the film .  most people will come out of the theater thinking ,  and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories . 
974 0 what did the director think? everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that tassi was guilty .  that fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her man .  why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic ,  are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happy-happy-mood won? while i would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisia's life story on its head .  very disappointing choice by the makers of this film . 
975 1 a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story ,  the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty ,  depth and character . <br /><br />	it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't NOT_give NOT_it NOT_to NOT_ralph NOT_fiennes ,  who would have murdered it . ) similarly ,  emily watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage) .  to reach the tortured chess master (turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love .  watson does not NOT_portray NOT_beauty-pageant NOT_sexuality ,  but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring . <br /><br />	in a chance meeting between natalia (watson) and luzhin ,  she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that ,  we realize later in the film ,  has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations .  later ,  as their love affair develops ,  she subtly likens dancing to chess (luzhin has learnt to dance but never NOT_with NOT_a NOT_partner); NOT_she NOT_encourages NOT_him NOT_to NOT_lead NOT_her NOT_with NOT_"bold ,  brilliant moves" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover) . <br /><br />	this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and ,  in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment ,  emotionally and intellectually (or so we are led to believe - certainly ,  within the time frame ,  natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother) . <br /><br />	the italian sets are stunning .  the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer ,  yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit ,  and most deservedly so .  chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie ,  although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed .  although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author ,  the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting . 
976 0 an awful film! it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe .  they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition .  my complaint is not NOT_that NOT_they've NOT_taken NOT_liberties NOT_with NOT_the NOT_facts; NOT_if NOT_the NOT_story NOT_were NOT_good ,  that would perfectly fine .  but it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film ,  so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? i suppose there weren't NOT_enough NOT_naked NOT_people NOT_in NOT_the NOT_factual NOT_version .  it's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity . 
977 1 part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson (2 reasons enough to watch) ,  was a period piece and involved chess .  everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected .  i shan't ,  therefore ,  give away much more .  suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric ,  obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him .  it's about love and obsession ,  rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour ,  became totally compelling .  and i defy anyone to second-guess the ending . 
978 0 the acting is good ,  the women are beautiful ,  and the men are handsome ,  so if you're looking for well-acted soft porn ,  this movie is for you .  otherwise ,  you are wasting your time .  the motivation of the main characters ,  in particular the eponymous lead ,  is often a mystery .  she could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film ,  not NOT_necessarily NOT_the NOT_historical NOT_truth NOT_- NOT_and NOT_her NOT_lover NOT_would NOT_have NOT_been NOT_spared NOT_time NOT_in NOT_jail NOT_for NOT_a NOT_rape NOT_he NOT_did NOT_not NOT_commit .  was she protecting her father ,  who went off half-cocked ,  as it were ,  when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit? was she protecting herself ,  with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter? during the trial ,  this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes .  conversely ,  her lover ,  who starts off as a narcissistic jerk ,  becomes a selfless hero during the trial .  at least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love .  naturally ,  since no NOT_good NOT_deed NOT_must NOT_go NOT_unpunished ,  we are told that she never NOT_sees NOT_him NOT_again . 
979 1 walking home after the film ,  i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to .  i've heard that before - where? ah ,  from kubrick's "eyes wide shut" (track 2) ,  'got it just as i arrived at the door .  it's "waltz no .  2 from jazz suite no .  2" composed by dimitri shostakovich ,  performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra .  yes ,  i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower's .  what a treat! the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz .  it's not NOT_often NOT_these NOT_days NOT_we NOT_get NOT_a NOT_soundtrack NOT_entirely NOT_dedicated NOT_to NOT_a NOT_comprehensive NOT_film NOT_score .  reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ,  ennio morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of "nuovo cinema paradiso") ,  georges delerue ,  and john barry .  there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings ,  celeste ,  piano ,  and harp .  <br /><br />emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance .  the love story ,  their intimate connection ,  is very much between alexandre and natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world ,  and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both .  director marleen gorris of "antonia's line" (1996 academy award's best foreign language film from the netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not NOT_without NOT_its NOT_unsettling NOT_human NOT_conflicts ,  intrigues ,  obsessions ,  family strives ,  lovingness and respect .  the front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess .  beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's .  cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss border . <br /><br />i highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_going NOT_to NOT_the NOT_movies .  alexandre desplat's lyrical film score of "the luzhin defence" is complete .

NOT_and NOT_plasters NOT_it NOT_with NOT_sex NOT_and NOT_scandal NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_film ,  well ,  interesting ,  but not NOT_remarkable . <br /><br />the story is about one of the first female painters around ,  artemesia who course ,  is fiercely independent ,  but just can't NOT_stop NOT_thinking NOT_of NOT_men ,  and their bodiesâ… for artistic purposes of course .  she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist ,  but soon tutoring becomes much more then art ,  and soon after that ,  scandal erupts! funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft-porn fantasy .  i mean ,  was artemesia that much of a man-hungry person? also ,  it's quite funny when she's insisting that she "paints for herself!" yet falls for the first person she sees . <br /><br />actually ,  the story itself is quite fascinating ,  and it ends with a trial ,  which i always love .  but i wasn't NOT_too NOT_crazy NOT_about NOT_the NOT_male NOT_lead NOT_who NOT_played NOT_her NOT_teacher ,  who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn't NOT_fall NOT_for .  i woulda gone for the young fisherman :p 
981 1 obsession comes in many flavors ,  and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder ,  but for others it may be an avenue of survival .  lack of nurturing ,  combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements ,  may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone .  and in extreme cases ,  the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession ,  driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing ,  and as we discover in `the luzhin defence , ' directed by marleen gorris ,  a high level of intelligence will not NOT_insure NOT_a NOT_satisfactory NOT_resolution NOT_to NOT_the NOT_problem ,  and in fact ,  may actually exacerbate the situation .  obsession ,  it seems ,  has no NOT_prejudice NOT_or NOT_preference; NOT_moreover ,  it gives no NOT_quarter . <br /><br />	at an italian resort in the 1920's ,  alexander luzhin (john turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament ,  the winner of which will be the world champion .  luzhin is a master of the game ,  but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather ,  it is his obsession ,  that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life ,  and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family .  so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel ,  a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands ,  and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament .  that man is valentinov (stuart wilson) ,  luzhin's former mentor ,  who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin . <br /><br />	valentinov is an unwelcomed ,  disconcerting presence to luzhin ,  and once again life threatens to overwhelm him .  not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_he NOT_about NOT_to NOT_face NOT_a NOT_formidable NOT_opponent NOT_in NOT_the NOT_tournament ,  turati (fabio sartor) ,  against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours ,  but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort ,  natalia (emily watson) .  and ,  genius though he may be ,  dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace ,  as well the curse ,  of his entire life . <br /><br />	to tell luzhin's story ,  gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess .  and as his background is established ,  it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life .  for the scenes of his childhood ,  gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into ,  and underlies ,  the present ,  more pastoral setting of the resort .  the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled ,  and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting ,  yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well .  she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov ,  concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense ,  which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film ,  making luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling . <br /><br />	the single element that makes this film so memorable ,  however ,  is the affecting performance of john turturro .  for this film to work ,  luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous ,  as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately .  it doesn't NOT_happen ,  however ,  and the film does work ,  because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life .  he captures luzhin's genius ,  as well as his inadequacies ,  and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real .  it's a performance equal to ,  if not NOT_surpassing ,  geoffrey rush's portrayal of david helfgott in `shine . ' and when you compare his work here with other characters he's created ,  from sid lidz in `unstrung heroes' to pete in `o brother where art thou?' to al fountain in `box of moonlight , ' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor ,  and what a remarkable artist he truly is . <br /><br />	as natalia ,  emily watson is excellent ,  as well ,  turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely .  though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin ,  watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective .  most importantly ,  because of the detail she brings to her performance ,  it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story .  you have but to look into watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real .  it's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor . <br /><br />	the supporting cast includes geraldine james (vera) ,  christopher thompson (stassard) ,  peter blythe (ilya) ,  orla brady (anna) ,  mark tandy (luzhin's father) ,  kelly hunter (luzhin's mother) ,  alexander hunting (young luzhin) and luigi petrucci (santucci) .  well crafted and delivered ,  `the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film ,  presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man .  we don't NOT_need NOT_a NOT_movie ,  of course ,  to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never NOT_forget ,  inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change ,  and to make a difference in the lives of those around us .  i rate this one 9/10 .  <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> 
982 0 as others have noted ,  this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life and i for one was very annoyed and offended .  .  .  by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair ,  by the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent , ' by its complete disregard for her work ,  by the way it turned her into a sex object ,  on and on ,  you get the idea .  also ,  i find it disturbing that people who aren't NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_gentileschi NOT_will NOT_see NOT_this NOT_film NOT_and NOT_walk NOT_away NOT_with NOT_that NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_impression NOT_of NOT_her . 
983 1 take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles .  this was the premise of the show ,  simple yet outrageous & funny .  leave it to fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow .  it was like a real-life version of melrose place .  the good thing about the show is that it wasn't NOT_about NOT_people NOT_conniving NOT_& NOT_manipulating NOT_each NOT_other NOT_for NOT_a NOT_cash NOT_prize .  it was about lust & temptation ,  pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship . <br /><br />people either loved the show or hated it .  it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident .  you know you shouldn't watch ,  but you can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_look .  drama aside ,  there was a lot of eye candy . 
984 0 if you're after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi ,  you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme ,  you've found you're movie . <br /><br />this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep .  (type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs .  fiction articles . ) from a purely technical point of view though ,  the film was alright: the sets ,  costumes ,  and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit . <br /><br />i wonder how the director/co-writer agnã¨s merlet defended her film at the time? perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim ,  which would've been unfortunate ,  because lets face it ,  she was . 
985 1 let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice ,  i do not NOT_consider NOT_myself NOT_a NOT_trekker NOT_or NOT_trekkie .  those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears .  i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors .  the acting was better than average ,  but the plot held no NOT_surprises .  they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation .  now as to the historical errors ,  if you call them that ,  the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april ,  then capt .  pike ,  jim kirk ,  etc .  .  according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's the reason a prime directive was created) but like i said these are no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_discredit NOT_this NOT_fine NOT_series .  i hope the plots will get deeper ,  and then special effects can take a backseat .

987 1 i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember .  when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excited . <br /><br />the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait .  it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters .  the nx-01 ,  enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love . <br /><br />scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer .  jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol .  that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleet . <br /><br />enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching ,  and i recommend that .  watch it . 
988 0 sloppily directed ,  witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" films ,  but really is no NOT_better NOT_than NOT_them ,  except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects) .  and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail ("casino royale" ,  "our man flint" are worse than almost any james bond movie) .  after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens ,  you'll be begging for some peace and quiet .  (*1/2) 
989 1 this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series .  it has a "down to earth"-kind of feel with darker and less "plaggy" scenography . <br /><br />the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential .  one thing that is fairly disappointing (with all star trek series really) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else .  (earth has stopped war ,  famine etc)<br /><br /> the female characters here are two ,  subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human .  hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a "vulcan babe" . <br /><br /> some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american (as opposed to the more international feel of the tng-crew) but creates interesting dynamics . <br /><br /> a very good pilot though for a very good series . 
990 0 this was an incredibly stupid movie .  it was possibly the worst movie i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through .  i cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
991 1 <br /><br />there is star trek canon -- lots of it .  from canon we know the history of the future .  advances in technology ,  events ,  places ,  first contacts with new beings ,  names ,  dates ,  etc . <br /><br />enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon .  an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans .  as one ,  i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there -- but no . <br /><br />the phase pistols ,  like much of the technology ,  look much more modern than found in tos .  an old style starfleet laser gun ,  a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what i expected to see .  also ,  i did not NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_hear NOT_pure NOT_beep-based NOT_sound NOT_effects NOT_similar NOT_to NOT_tng NOT_but NOT_far NOT_apart NOT_from NOT_tos NOT_sound NOT_effects .  <br /><br />in the earliest view of tos (the original pilot: the cage) ,  we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth navy .  with enterprise ,  we see a shocking disregard for rank .  there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise . <br /><br />it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe (quite unlike kirk who never NOT_lacked NOT_confidence NOT_in NOT_his NOT_application NOT_of NOT_human NOT_justice) ,  but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal .  unprofessional ,  unsure ,  more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series -- and that says a lot!<br /><br />the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel . <br /><br />enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun ,  warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic ,  bold ,  gritty ,  high-rick exploration of space . <br /><br />i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor .  still ,  i liked the actors for the most part .  linda park ,  an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college ,  is sure to develop nicely .  the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created . <br /><br />enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series .  let's hope for a good future! 
992 0 imagine you're a high-school boy ,  in the back of a dark ,  uncrowded theater with your girlfriend .  how bad would a movie have to be ,  in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended? this movie is that bad .  really .  movies often become so bad that they're good; this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness .  it is painfully bad .  horribly ,  terribly ,  crime-against-humanity bad . 
993 1 enterprise is the entertainment ,  but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow .  with gratitude and respect mr .  berman and mr .  braga .  i wish you well ,  thank you both for your service to trek . <br /><br />enterprise is what trek is about .  .  . 
994 0 this is a really dumb movie .  it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting ,  but it just isn't . <br /><br />some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween .  they come to earth to kill humans ,  but instead of killing ,  they make people their slaves and act goofy .  the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space .  .  . not NOT_really NOT_what NOT_they NOT_do .  these aren't NOT_party NOT_aliens ,  they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices .  the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses .  other than the aliens ,  the acting is terrible .  the writing is obviously meant for children ,  because every character is written like a kid . <br /><br />this is a dumb movie ,  that only children will appreciate ,  maybe . <br /><br />my rating: 1/2 out of **** .  100 mins .  pg for mild language . 
995 1 call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series .  if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series ,  you should definitely watch this one .  perhaps more compelling than that of voyager's caretaker ,  which launched the series with cpt .  janeway ,  archer's adventures are completely different ,  yet strangely familiar .  .  . the music is catchy too .  no NOT_true NOT_sci-fi NOT_fan NOT_can NOT_go NOT_without NOT_seeing NOT_at NOT_least NOT_one NOT_star NOT_trek NOT_episode--and NOT_these NOT_installments NOT_make NOT_the NOT_wait NOT_worthwhile . 
996 0 i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny .  i saw it again last week ,  and you can guess the result .  some funny parts in it ,  very few and too long .  the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me . <br /><br />if you want a total b-movie this is a good pick ,  but don't NOT_expect NOT_too NOT_much NOT_from NOT_aliens NOT_dwarf NOT_size 
997 1 this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered .  not NOT_to NOT_slight NOT_ds9 .  that was a wonderful show in it's own right ,  however it never NOT_really NOT_gave NOT_the NOT_fans NOT_more NOT_of NOT_what NOT_they NOT_wanted .  enterprise is that show .  while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways .  it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again .  and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved .  another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members .  viewers really cared deeply for the crew .  enterprise has much promise in this area as well .  the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising .  while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch ,  i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical .  i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even ,  we get some very interesting ideas and television .  also ,  we should note the performances ,  blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance .  the rest of the cast delivered good performances also .  my only gripes are as follows .  the theme .  it's good it's different ,  but a little to light hearted for my liking .  we need something a little more grand .  doesn't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_orchestral .  maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice .  and my one other complaint .  they sell too many adds .  they could fix this by selling less ads ,  or making all shows two parters .  otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager . 
998 0 the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning ,  but their 'scare' factor is very limited ,  if one exists at all .  in fact i am sure i will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer . <br /><br />the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel ,  the undisputed low of a channel full of lows .  i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is ,  but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site ,  i will at least give it a go . <br /><br />firstly the title is misleading and bears no NOT_resemblance NOT_to NOT_the NOT_action NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen .  in fact the film might as well have been called 'toothbrush' or 'wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot .  at least they used toothbrushes .  .  . at least they had wallpaper . <br /><br />there are no NOT_bloodsuckers NOT_for NOT_miles NOT_around NOT_and NOT_whats NOT_even NOT_worse NOT_there NOT_are NOT_no NOT_dances ,  not NOT_one .  i'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here . <br /><br />a more suitable title would have been ,  'horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes . ' yes that fits better . <br /><br />the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling ,  and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character .  .  .  . abysmal . <br /><br />the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene ,  two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes ,  and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off .  bonus . <br /><br />otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one .  no NOT_vampires ,  no NOT_dancing ,  no NOT_scenes NOT_of NOT_a NOT_brutal NOT_or NOT_gruesome NOT_nature NOT_and NOT_no NOT_way NOT_on NOT_gods NOT_earth NOT_i NOT_will NOT_ever ,  ever ,  ever watch this one again . <br /><br />no word of a lie ,  this film could put you off motion pictures for life . 
999 1 the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek: a dose of realistic ,  flawed personalities .  the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring ,  they were so noble as to be unbelievable .  i also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans .  its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs .  it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two ,  though i don't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_would NOT_work NOT_in NOT_the NOT_time NOT_frame NOT_of NOT_the NOT_show .  the only negatives that jumped out at me were the "quick cut off the ending at 2 hours" feel of the end ,  which is common among many of the trek shows .  the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes .  it was out of place ,  a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin .  but its not NOT_my NOT_job NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_show NOT_profitable ,  so oh well . <br /><br />lets see how the next episode does . 
1000 0 the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title ,  it's so utterly misleading .  it's not NOT_surprising NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film-makers NOT_try NOT_and NOT_mislead NOT_us NOT_though NOT_because NOT_this NOT_is NOT_one NOT_terrible NOT_movie . <br /><br />the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island . <br /><br />very little happens in this film .  and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor ,  it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists .  these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons .  it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal .  but the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script .  it's a travesty .  unintentionally funny at best ,  pathetic at worst .  the story in general is ,  to say the least ,  uneven .  the women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious . <br /><br />the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience .  it doesn't NOT_remotely NOT_deliver NOT_what NOT_it NOT_promises NOT_and NOT_even NOT_when NOT_the NOT_murders NOT_(finally) NOT_start NOT_happening ,  they all occur off screen .  all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots . <br /><br />a few people have said that this movie is a giallo .  i cannot agree less with this opinion .  anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it .  it's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle .  but it's not NOT_very NOT_erotic NOT_either . <br /><br />i can't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_to NOT_anyone .

1002 0 la sanguisuga conduce la danza ,  or the bloodsucker leads the dance as i believe is it's common english title ,  is set on 'ireland' in '1902' where the mysterious count richard marnack (giacomo rossi-stuart) invites soon-to-be out of work theatre actress evelyn (patrizia webley as patrizia de rossi) & three more of her fellow soon-to-be out of work actress friends cora (krista nell) ,  penny (lidia olizzi) & rosalind (marzia damon as caterina chiani) to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast .  at first evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand samuel (leo valeriano) goes along as well .  once there count marnack tells his guests that his father & grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife & there's a feeling of unease when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current count's wife who ran away not NOT_too NOT_long NOT_ago .  .  .  along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off .  .  . <br /><br />this italian production was written & directed by alfredo rizzo & is total ,  complete & utter crap from start to finish .  first things first lets start the criticism with the title the bloodsucker leads the dance ,  lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there aren't NOT_any NOT_vampires NOT_or NOT_any NOT_form NOT_of NOT_bloodsucking NOT_whatsoever ,  no-one 'leads' anything at anytime & there most certainly isn't NOT_any NOT_dance NOT_or NOT_dancing NOT_so NOT_don't NOT_expect NOT_any NOT_of NOT_these NOT_things .  what you should expect though is a tedious ,  dull ,  boring pointless little 'giallo' that takes over an hour before anyone is killed & any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape ,  the first hour of la sanguisuga conduce la danza is as plot less & uninteresting as anything out there .  the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft-core porn film you've ever seen ,  then cut most of the soft-core porn out & that just leaves bad actors ,  bad dubbing ,  bad dialogue ,  a tiny bit of soft-core sex & lesbianism & absolutely nothing else .  yep ,  it really is that bad .  the mystery elements are crap ,  people do illogical things for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason NOT_& NOT_the NOT_overly NOT_complicated NOT_'twist' NOT_ending NOT_is NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_it ,  the sixth sense (1999) this ain't!<br /><br />director rozzi does an ok job & la sanguisga conduce la danza actually has a nice look & feel to it despite it's obvious low budget ,  i mean there are scenes where he shows a 'storm' raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black & white! so the film jumps from bright colour to black & white whenever it cuts to the storm & back to colour again! there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid & her friend discuss her breasts & she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments ,  this scene is so funny & just so unnatural that it's priceless & easily the films best moment even if a bad 70's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue! there is minimal nudity & the sex/lesbian scenes are very tame .  forget about any blood or gore as there isn't NOT_any NOT_apart NOT_from NOT_a NOT_decapitated NOT_head . <br /><br />technically the films pretty good ,  the period setting & production design are actually quite impressive although it's not NOT_massive NOT_in NOT_scope NOT_it NOT_does NOT_the NOT_job NOT_effectively NOT_enough .  the film has a nice sense of colour & the cinematography is fine .  the film is dubbed so it's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible & the dialogue is even worse than usual . <br /><br />la sanguisuga conduce la danza is a terrible film ,  it makes no NOT_sense ,  it has virtually no NOT_story NOT_for NOT_over NOT_an NOT_hour ,  it has possibly the most misleading title ever & is really dull & boring with a confused stupid 'twist' ending .  as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time ,  as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid .  trivia note: the notorious (& banned in the uk) nazi exploitation/horror film horrifying experiments of the s . s last days (1977) aka ss hell camp & the beast in heat was directed by luigi batzella & he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la sanguisuga conduce la danza . 
1003 1 i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet ,  i say potential .  .  we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas .  .  .  but i hope not! for those that have not NOT_seen NOT_it .  . see it! without that annoying "prime directive" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool .  .  and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain ,  and the vulcan babe is hot too ,  (check out the decontamination scene)i gave this a full 10 .  .  .  it blows away all the other series openers .  .  i hope this goes longer than 7 years .  .  . 
1004 0 this movie is not NOT_only NOT_a NOT_very NOT_bad NOT_movie ,  with awful actors --or presumed actors-- ,  a bored direction and a story unattractive ,  it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent "giallio" "torso" ,  directed by sergio martino in 1973 (two years before) ,  one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world .  in "la sanguinusa conduce la danza" ,  the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl ,  with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom .  naturally ,  the scene in rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino's film .  to put another black girl ,  another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo's movie has no NOT_ideas ,  no NOT_originality ,  no NOT_taste ,  and nothing at all .  i think that such things are an offense to spectator . 
1005 1 ok ,  so ,  this is coming a few weeks late ,  but it is here .  mostly ,  this is because of statements of various negative natures .  starting with the technology .  when star trek: tos ran ,  special effect technology was extreamely low tec ,  and more than that ,  the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups .  in the 35 years seince tos premiered ,  the crew of star trek have become experts at economy . <br /><br />ultimately ,  they have decided ,  quite rightly in my mind ,  to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all .  so what if they decided not NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_transporter NOT_out NOT_of NOT_gold NOT_glitter NOT_or NOT_made NOT_the NOT_phase NOT_pistols NOT_look NOT_closer NOT_to NOT_the NOT_ones NOT_from NOT_star NOT_trek NOT_ii? NOT_as NOT_for NOT_the NOT_nits NOT_being NOT_picked NOT_about NOT_first NOT_contact NOT_with NOT_the NOT_klingon NOT_empire ,  it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200 .  nothing was firmly established . <br /><br />enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while .  this is what voyager could have been .  no NOT_series NOT_can NOT_evolve NOT_without NOT_a NOT_few NOT_inconsistancies ,  but be thankful that star trek has so few .  so ,  quit gripping and enjoy . 
1006 0 after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles ,  redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance .  i found no NOT_bloodsuckers NOT_anywhere NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie . <br /><br />the story is simple .  a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation .  after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one .  who is the killer? who knows? there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday . <br /><br />the pace is excruciating .  the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't NOT_all NOT_that NOT_terrific NOT_either . <br /><br />give this one a miss . 
1007 1 after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb .  next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek .  this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show .  the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts .  scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before .  the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season .  when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed .  in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of .  pity a film or tv movie was never NOT_considered .  so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell ,  including the onset of hostilities with the klingons .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
1008 0 a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot (if anything ,  the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot!) ,  this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo (with a strong dose of erotica) only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout â– actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful! here ,  we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a count â– since he had become enamored of the leading lady ,  a dead-ringer for his missing spouse)! the characters are pretty much stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing hero (played by giacomo rossi-stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy) ,  demure heroine ,  sluttish companion (recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot!) ,  a meek but devoted stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!) ,  a couple of lesbians ,  a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who ,  for once ,  gets in on the action ,  if you know what i mean) ,  an envious housekeeper (nominal star femi benussi though ,  for what it is worth ,  this is really an ensemble piece) ,  a religious fanatic of a butler ,  an impressionable chambermaid ,  etc .  while the film is not NOT_by NOT_any NOT_means NOT_unwatchable ,  the atrocious dubbing ,  snail's pace ,  shoddy production (with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not NOT_help NOT_matters .  besides ,  marcello giombini's score ,  though pleasant in itself ,  comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said ,  the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one (considering there is surely no NOT_shortage NOT_of NOT_suspects NOT_here) . 
1009 1 okay ,  the recent history of star trek has not NOT_been NOT_good .  the next generation faded in its last few seasons ,  ds9 boldly stayed where no NOT_one NOT_had NOT_stayed NOT_before ,  and voyager started very bad and never NOT_really NOT_lived NOT_up NOT_to NOT_its NOT_promise .  so ,  when they announced a new star trek series ,  i did not NOT_have NOT_high NOT_expectations .  and ,  the first episode ,  broken bow ,  did have some problems .  but ,  overall it was solid trek material and a good romp . <br /><br />i'll get the nits out of the way first .  the opening theme is dull and i don't NOT_look NOT_forward NOT_to NOT_sitting NOT_through NOT_it NOT_regularly ,  but that's what remotes are for .  what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room .  they need to cut that nonsense out . <br /><br />but ,  the plot was strong and moved along well .  the characters ,  though still new ,  seem to be well rounded and not NOT_always NOT_what NOT_you NOT_would NOT_expect .  the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before ,  with a slightly ominous theme .  i particularly liked the linguist ,  who is the first star trek character to not NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_stand NOT_proud NOT_in NOT_the NOT_face NOT_of NOT_death ,  but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears .  they seemed to stay true to trek lore ,  something that has been a significant problem in past series ,  though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields ,  the instant invention of technology that can fix anything ,  and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories .  anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show up?<br /><br />all in all ,  the series has enormous potential .  they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes .  we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series .  how did the klingons go from just insulting to war? how did we meet the romulans? how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge .  why is the prime directive so important? if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes ,  this will be an interesting series . <br /><br />my favorite line: zephram cochran saying "where no NOT_man NOT_has NOT_gone NOT_before" NOT_(not NOT_"no NOT_one") 
1010 0 wow-this one sucks .  i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible . â <br /><br />a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle .  a bunch of nothing happens for a long time .  some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen .  some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-the end . <br /><br />the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes ,  some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue ,  and a few brief nudie shots .  and believe me-those things are not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_redeem NOT_the NOT_90-minutes NOT_of NOT_tedium NOT_that NOT_this NOT_film NOT_is .  in fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_price NOT_of NOT_admission NOT_for NOT_this NOT_garbage .  as everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no NOT_bloodsucking ,  nor dancing of any sort in the film at all .  it may as well have been called 'the goat-raper leads the circle-jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film .  an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful .  .  . for the viewer .  honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely .  .  . ) so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious .  â i can't NOT_imagine NOT_anyone NOT_liking NOT_this NOT_wreck NOT_of NOT_a NOT_film-please NOT_take NOT_my NOT_advice NOT_and NOT_leave NOT_this NOT_one NOT_on NOT_the NOT_shelf .  2/10â  
1011 1 a very good start .  i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not NOT_quite NOT_so NOT_advanced: NOT_it NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_cruder ,  to match we saw in the original series .  the cast is interesting ,  although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human .  she needs to school on spock who ,  after all ,  is the model for this race .  too bad they couldn't have picked jeri ryan .  i like ms .  park ,  the korean(?)lady .  the doctor has possibilities .  haven't sorted out the other males ,  except for the black guy .  he's a really likeable .  bakula needs to find his niche--in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything .  he is ,  of course ,  big and strong enough for the heroics .  the heavies were ok ,  although i didn't NOT_like NOT_their NOT_make-up . 
1012 0 (aka: the bloodsucker leads the dance)<br /><br />lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in .  the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me . <br /><br />gothic lesbians get invited to a count's island castle for the weekend .  one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around . <br /><br />it's not NOT_very NOT_scary NOT_or NOT_bloody NOT_and NOT_the NOT_rooms NOT_look NOT_like NOT_they NOT_are NOT_lit NOT_with NOT_floodlights NOT_even NOT_though NOT_candles NOT_are NOT_lit .  go figure .  .  . (sic)<br /><br />dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity .  directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo ,  this is one snoozer . <br /><br />pretty boring 2 out of 10 
1013 1 a strong pilot ,  this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for "enterprise , " the "prequel" to the original "star trek" series .  it stumbles a few times into "trek" convention and clichã©--candy-colored space strippers never NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_go NOT_out NOT_of NOT_style ,  and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as "seven of vulcan"--but the ensemble looks strong ,  the characters are well-drawn ,  and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful ,  in different ways ,  than those of earlier (later?) series .  scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger ,  and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer ,  weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players .  the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in "star trek: the next generation , " "deep space 9" and "voyager": instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift ,  it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which i hope happens ,  because after about a half-dozen episodes ,  more variety will be needed . 
1014 0 in contrast to my fellow reviewers ,  i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see . yes ,  the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal ,  the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping . something must be lost in the translation of the word "bloodsucker" from the italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not NOT_afford NOT_to NOT_give NOT_up NOT_their NOT_dramatic NOT_opening NOT_sequence ,  so tacked it onto the film anyway . <br /><br />this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film!now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - italian softporn from the mid 1970s . i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli (credited most often as "krista nell") . the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s . i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list ,  it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned . i think krista nell played "cora" but underneath that massive hair style ,  costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure . <br /><br />there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no NOT_one NOT_really NOT_stands NOT_out . maybe something is lost in the dubbing process . what were the positive points?well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there . the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island . it purports to be set in "ireland" (north or the republic?)in 1902 ,  so everyone sports period piece costumes . some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!anyway an enjoyable romp . i rated it 4/10 . 
1015 1 enterprise ,  the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'broken bow' .  first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show) .  from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is ,  with some of the best character development ,  story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time . <br /><br />the opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans ,  whom some believe that the song is out of place .  what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves .  if one listens to the actual song ,  instead of the theme ,  then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together .  and eventually as the series progresses further and further ,  and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew ,  will the song actually become meaningful .  overall diane warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson . <br /><br />what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered .  enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since the next generation .  choosing scott bakula ,  as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean-luc picard .  as the captain always leads the show ,  bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins .  he simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm ,  wit ,  and compassion are overwhelming to watch .  as for the other cast members ,  a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr .  phlox .  it's also nice to see a non-human playing a role ,  and the decision to give the captain a dog ,  named 'porthos' was a well-received idea .  throughout the show character development was brilliant ,  it was fast ,  well timed and almost perfect .  i say almost because sadly travis mayweather's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season .  he does have some things to say here and there ,  but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important .  jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol .  dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer .  connor trinneer plays commander charles "trip" tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato ,  who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting .  all of these characters make up enterprise ,  and all bring a quality that star trek hasn't seen in a long time .  each person makes this show worth watching .  smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx-01 . <br /><br />the ship itself ,  the nx-01 is somewhat questionable in design .  the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk .  so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships ,  namely the akira class starship? continuity has been an issue in enterprise ,  but thankfully rick [berman] and brannon [braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them .  continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details .  if you see the show with and open mind ,  then you'll have no NOT_problems ,  but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time .  so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? according to them the nx-01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact .  when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise-e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker ,  it changed the ideas in his head .  that's a good enough explanation for me . lets move on .  of course its not NOT_as NOT_easy NOT_for NOT_some NOT_fans NOT_to NOT_accept NOT_that NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_answer ,  some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer .  come on guys grow up . when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy ,  fans couldn't do anything ,  only watch and sap it all up anyway .  and then they learned that ,  well maybe its not NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_after NOT_all .  if you can't NOT_accept NOT_a NOT_quality NOT_show NOT_for NOT_what NOT_it NOT_is ,  not NOT_what NOT_it NOT_should NOT_be NOT_in NOT_your NOT_mind ,  then go elsewhere .  or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do . <br /><br />the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine .  they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military .  perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise (aka flagship of the american fleet) like it so much .  they are striking sets ,  and represent the show perfectly . <br /><br />rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have ,  and in all the right places .  whether that be technicalities ,  visuals ,  sound ,  editing or score .  enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be ,  when in the hands of geniuses .  the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan ,  so should you .

1017 1 in 2151 ,  in broken bow ,  oklahoma ,  a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital .  the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor .  however ,  captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet .  jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr .  phlox ,  who is treating klaang ,  to complete his crew ,  and the vulcan sub-commander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise .  when the equipment of the starship is shut-down ,  klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital .  after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting ,  captain archer is informed by dr .  phlox that the alien was actually a mutant ,  altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process .  t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x .  they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier ,  bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronos . <br /><br />in spite of being a huge fan of star trek ,  i have not NOT_followed NOT_the NOT_episodes NOT_of NOT_"enterprise" NOT_on NOT_cable NOT_television .  i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me .  the adventure of the first enterprise ,  captain jonathan archer ,  the gorgeous t'pol ,  reed ,  mayweather ,  dr .  phlox ,  hoshi and trip is excellent ,  at least in this pilot .  i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts ,  but on dvd they are just one ,  therefore my review is valid for both .  i did not NOT_like NOT_the NOT_music NOT_score NOT_theme ,  which i found very annoying ,  but this was an exception in this great show .  my vote is nine . <br /><br />title (brazil): "broken bow" 
1018 0 this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany . <br /><br />i find "the wooden horse" disappointingly boring .  the subject could have been thrilling ,  suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled ,  but "the wooden horse" is told in a very plain way .  it's a collection of plain and poorly told events ,  with no NOT_suspension NOT_and NOT_thrill .  the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel ,  but the events are so plain ,  with not NOT_enough NOT_blunders NOT_and NOT_close NOT_shaves NOT_to NOT_make NOT_me NOT_on NOT_edge .  the latter half of the film is even worse ,  they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase .  and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! i am disappointed by "the wooden horse" ,  it wasted the potential to be a great film . 
1019 1 "broken bow" takes us back to where it all began .  set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk ,  spock and mccoy .  this installment of the "star trek" franchise ,  is in my opinion the first series since "tos" to recapture the feelings of wonder ,  danger and excitement of "going where no NOT_man NOT_has NOT_gone NOT_before" .  scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer ,  the first captain of the first "star ship enterprise" .  he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy .  john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr .  phlox ,  and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer t'pol .  broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks ,  and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud . 
1020 0 this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio .  the plot is simply stupid .  the dialog is written in clichã©s; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this .  the acting is ridiculously bad ,  especially that of rod cameron .  the "choreography" is silly and wholly unerotic .  one can only pity the reviewer who saw 23-year-old yvonne's dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography .  the ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous .  if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywood's turkeys ,  this is for you .  i bought the colorized version on vhs ,  making the movie even worse .  yvonne's heavy makeup ,  when colored ,  has her looking like a clown all the time .  and she's the best part of this film .  what a way to launch a career . 
1021 1 i just watched this for the first time in a long time - i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were ,  and how witty the movie is .  i had not NOT_forgotten NOT_however NOT_the NOT_opening NOT_scenes NOT_which NOT_are NOT_(with NOT_the NOT_scene NOT_at NOT_the NOT_candlelight NOT_club NOT_in NOT_waterloo NOT_bridge) NOT_among NOT_the NOT_most NOT_romantic NOT_ever NOT_filmed . <br /><br />anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's offhand references - anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunter-niven ,  and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworld . <br /><br />my favorite movie remains "odd man out" made near the same time - but this one is superb .  <br /><br /> 
1022 0 i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb .  i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at a . i . r .  as it was know as back then . thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_sit NOT_through NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing .  it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey ,  the pay was good . attention to detail was not NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_point NOT_for NOT_this NOT_one ,  but who was going to know . the funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed . a lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and time . but every one was having such a good time who cared! 
1023 1 i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv (before the days of cable and satellite) matinã©e .  i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film .  i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it .  david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around .  i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not NOT_more NOT_than NOT_sean NOT_connery NOT_or NOT_anthony NOT_hopkins .  the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy ,  marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough . 
1024 0 it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films .  i'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging ,  controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity .  if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be "stroker ace" .  this film is awful with a capital 'a' .  it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in .  .  .  .  quite a feat for for a man with "cannonball run ii" ,  "cop and a half" and "rent-a-cop" on his cv!<br /><br />the wafer-thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace (reynolds) ,  a man who loves fast cars and fast women .  he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle (ned beatty) .  the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants ,  such as dressing up as a giant chicken .  thrown into the mix are lugs (jim nabors) ,  ace's dim-witted pal ,  and pembrook feeney (loni anderson) ,  a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by ace . <br /><br />hal needham ,  the director of this low-grade garbage ,  was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases/races .  some of these films were ok ,  like "hooper" and "stunts unlimited" ,  but with "stroker ace" he reaches a career nadir .  the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them .  anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair .  the humour is weak and infantile throughout ,  and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable .  even the out-takes during the closing credits (which can be found in all the reynolds-needham collaborations) are generally unfunny ,  which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't NOT_much NOT_fun NOT_to NOT_make .  "stroker ace" is a stinker of considerable magnitude . 
1025 1 "stairway to heaven" is a outstanding invention of movie making ,  probably never NOT_duplicated .  i rank it with "the wizard of oz" and "african queen , " although it is a totally different type of movie than "african queen . " "stairway to heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that ,  to my knowledge ,  are totally unique .  <br /><br />for example ,  there is the combination of b&w and color footage - as in "oz , " but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in "oz . " in "stairway" the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful . <br /><br />another brilliant aspect of "stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here .  how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still â– literally? and then there is the stairway itself!<br /><br />if you have any imagination at all ,  you will agree with me .  "stairway to heaven" is a true gem . 
1026 0 burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions .  he'd show up ,  party with his friends on film ,  and take home a big paycheck .  it didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_matter NOT_to NOT_him NOT_that NOT_the NOT_product NOT_he NOT_was NOT_representing NOT_was NOT_pure NOT_crap . <br /><br />no film epitomized this more than "stroker ace" which makes "cannonball run" look like a classic and "cannonball run ii" look watchable .  save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here .  even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing . <br /><br />if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie .  otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't NOT_be NOT_any NOT_worse . 
1027 1 <br /><br />filmed just after the war ,  this story was made in order to highlight anglo-american relations after the war .  it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwii . <br /><br />remarkably the film tangles together the royal air force ,  sigmund freud psychology ,  the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs (special effects in its infancy) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity .  <br /><br />although sounding absurd ,  this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since .  <br /><br />be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet ,  innocent and charming love story .  roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!! <br /><br />british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years . <br /><br /> 
1028 0 this is one of the most insipid ,  lackluster ,  unoriginal ,  and pointless movies ever made! it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't NOT_even NOT_try NOT_to NOT_make NOT_an NOT_appealing NOT_movie .  this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit ,  which i think is the best film of them all .  as for this waste of film stock ,  burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie ,  jim nabors is wasted ,  the other actors aren't NOT_given NOT_very NOT_much NOT_to NOT_do ,  the car races are obviously stock footage ,  the humor is uninspired ,  and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours .  "stroker ace" is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it . 
1029 1 surely one of the best british films ever made ,  if not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_best NOT_films NOT_ever NOT_made NOT_anywhere .  script ,  cinematography ,  direction and acting in a class on their own .  this film works on so many levels .  so why is it completely unavailable on tape ,  dvd .  never NOT_shown NOT_on NOT_tv?

1030 0 oh man is this movie bad .  it flows horribly .  the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself ,  and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this ,  doesn't NOT_love NOT_himself .  he tries getting out of the contract and horrible ,  painfully unfunny gags ensue .  jim nabors seems as if he's sleepwalking ,  not NOT_acting .  you'll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker .  loni anderson's hair is downright scary ,  proving that tons of hairspray didn't NOT_go NOT_out NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sixties .  or maybe that was a wig .  speaking of ,  burt's wig wasn't NOT_bad NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  his worst "wig day" was in "smokey and the bandit 2" .  anyhow ,  this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ,  ever ,  ever ,  right up there with "cannonball run 2" .  the original "smokey" and "cannonball" (and "hooper" which ,  thankfully ,  had no NOT_sequel) NOT_are NOT_great ,  funny films .  this one isn't .  even ned beatty ,  who is a great actor ,  stinks .  you'll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate .  and mind you ,  this isn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_those NOT_fun NOT_movies NOT_to NOT_bag NOT_on .  it's lousy ,  pure and simple .  even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring ,  and worst of all ,  unfunny .  and least i forget ,  "stroker ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt's coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in "boogie nights" ,  another film that ,  like "deliverance" years earlier ,  shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so . 
1031 1 i remember the first time i saw this movie -- i was in the office working over the weekend & the tv was on for background noise .  but i gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie i'd never NOT_seen NOT_or NOT_heard NOT_of ,  until i was completely absorbed .  a matter of life & death (the british title -- stairway to heaven in the us) is delightful ,  compelling ,  whimsical ,  & moving ,  all in one superbly-written ,  well-acted ,  perfectly-directed package .  it's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca ,  it's a wonderful life ,  gone with the wind ,  citizen kane ,  & chariots of fire .  why has it never NOT_received NOT_the NOT_same NOT_public NOT_notice NOT_& NOT_video-store NOT_prominence? NOT_fortunately ,  some knowledgeable critics have put it on their "top 100 of all time" lists .  there is hope -- 1940's fantasia wasn't NOT_a NOT_hit NOT_'til NOT_the NOT_'60s ,  & the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office ,  but made a hit by tv .  buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it! you won't NOT_be NOT_disappointed! 
1032 0 ever notice how in his later movies burt reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?<br /><br />must have been hanging out with hal needham too much . <br /><br />and from the looks of "stroker ace" ,  way too much . <br /><br />can you believe this was based on a book? neither could i ,  but it was .  and probably not NOT_a NOT_best-seller ,  i'll wager .  <br /><br />burt's another good-old-boy in the nascar circuit who hitches up with beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team .  anderson provides what love interest there is and nabors does his umpteenth gomer pyle impression as faithful mechanic/best friend lugs .  <br /><br />a lot of people here are friends of burt's or hal's .  others must have needed the work .  and even real nascar drivers get in on the act ,  and look to have more talent than those with sag cards .  <br /><br />as far as laughs go ,  bubba smith (pre-"police academy") gets them as beatty's chauffeur .  and petersen ,  in full elvira mode ,  gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know lugs real well .  real well . <br /><br />it's a shame that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like "stroker ace" where it didn't NOT_matter NOT_whether NOT_he NOT_bothered NOT_to NOT_act NOT_or NOT_not .  they didn't NOT_bother NOT_to NOT_write NOT_a NOT_character NOT_for NOT_him ,  why bother to act?<br /><br />two stars .  mostly for petersen ,  and for the out-takes at the end .  now they're funny . 
1033 1 one of the few best films of all time .  the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellence . <br /><br />the plot is extremely clever ,  the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions ,  and although a war film it doesn't NOT_discriminate .  i must have seen this film more times than any other ,  and i never NOT_tire NOT_of NOT_it .  it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise . 
1034 0 "the return of chandu" is notable ,  if one can say that ,  for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain .  why he even gets the girl . <br /><br /> the story as such ,  involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji (the delectable maria alba) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji .  lugosi as chandu ,  who possesses magical powers ,  tries to thwart the villains . <br /><br /> director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage .  fans of king kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes .  the acting is for the most part ,  awful .  the actor who plays the high priest (i believe lucien prival) for example ,  uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies .  the less said about the others the better . <br /><br /> it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career ,  because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time .  maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl ,  who knows .  as his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s ,  this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception . <br /><br /> 
1035 1 pressburger and powell's greatest movie .  david niven plays the raf bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is awol and dispatches an angel to investigate .  the scene when the young soldiers ,  men and women ,  black and white ,  all killed in action ,  arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant .  watch out too for roger livesey ,  a deeply under appreciated actor ,  and kim hunter as the love interest (later ,  of course ,  zira in planet of the apes) .  incidentally ,  steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel (kathleen byron) as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later ,  an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy . 
1036 0 bela lugosi is not NOT_typecast NOT_in NOT_this NOT_fantastic NOT_twelve-part NOT_adventure NOT_serial ,  playing the lead as frank chandler/chandu the magician ,  enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black ,  while displaying vigourous fighting skill ,  successfully wooing a young egyptian princess ,  and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear ,  complete with nautical cap .  the somewhat lumpy plot engages chandler/chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee ,  princess nadji(maria alba) and others from the clutches of the idol-worshipping sect of ubasti ,  which covets nadji's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of lemuria .  director ray taylor ,  an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly ,  but repeated scenes and footage ,  a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's skull island setting from king kong ,  and the port locale from son of kong ,  reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one-half hours and ,  if viewed at one sitting ,  becomes lacking in effect to most viewers ,  unless insomniac . 
1037 1 also known as "stairway to heaven" in the us .  during wwii british peter carter's (david niven) plane is shot down in combat but he survives .  he meets and falls in love with lovely june (kim hunter) .  but it seems a mistake was made in heaven--he should have died! a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses .  he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live . <br /><br />sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film .  the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight-faced and it's beautifully directed--the scenes on earth are in breath-taking technicolor (i've never NOT_seen NOT_such NOT_beautiful NOT_blue NOT_skies) NOT_and NOT_the NOT_scenes NOT_in NOT_heaven NOT_are NOT_in NOT_black NOT_and NOT_white!

1038 0 at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films ,  the guy is usually unpopular with girls .  in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin .  but then you are not NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_engage NOT_your NOT_brain NOT_with NOT_this NOT_film NOT_or NOT_did NOT_i NOT_miss NOT_the NOT_bit NOT_about NOT_him NOT_being NOT_comatose NOT_for NOT_20 NOT_years?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>one NOT_of NOT_a NOT_series NOT_of NOT_films NOT_where NOT_40 NOT_somethings NOT_act NOT_like NOT_teenagers NOT_and NOT_women NOT_for NOT_some NOT_reason NOT_find NOT_this NOT_a NOT_sufficiently NOT_attractive NOT_quality NOT_that NOT_they NOT_want NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_relationship NOT_with NOT_them .  i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs .  they've done the gross out movies .  they've done the let's act like all americans have a mental age of 15 .  where will they go next? <br /><br />this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it . 
1039 1 i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never NOT_forgotten NOT_it .  it's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time .  it's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 ,  as the tale is still fresh today ,  and really makes one think .  i'm not NOT_very NOT_knowledgeable NOT_regarding NOT_film NOT_technique NOT_however NOT_the NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_are NOT_terrific NOT_considering NOT_when NOT_this NOT_was NOT_made .  in addition ,  the acting is superb ,  and the use of english and american actors quite astounding .  i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish .  i highly recommend anyone interested in post-war british films to watch this . 
1040 0 after we counted the use of the f word ,  oh ,  about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film ,  listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse ,  and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together ,  well ,  we turned it off .  relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie ,  the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers .  <br /><br />we did give it a second chance ,  thinking surely it would get better .  no NOT_dice .  later ,  my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved ,  still no NOT_dice . <br /><br />the main character did have a cool bike . <br /><br />i wouldn't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_to NOT_anyone NOT_except NOT_maybe NOT_really NOT_immature NOT_adolescents ,  or frat boys . 
1041 1 my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven ,  is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene .  and the trial itself ,  imo ,  is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy . <br /><br />david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers ,  but it's roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance .  french accented marius goring is a delight (he even gets in a remark about technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight .  goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish . <br /><br />seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years ,  i think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films .  the technicolor photography ,  somewhat subdued and not NOT_garish NOT_at NOT_all ,  is excellent and the way it shifts into b&w for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness . <br /><br />the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and niven's tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth ,  unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter .  truly a marvelous film from beginning to end ,  another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger . 
1042 0 wow! this film is truly awful .  i can't NOT_imagine NOT_how NOT_anyone NOT_could NOT_have NOT_read NOT_this NOT_badly NOT_written NOT_script NOT_and NOT_given NOT_it NOT_the NOT_greenlight .  the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast .  the story is disjointed ,  fragmented and incoherent .  the telling ,  leaden and predictable .  no NOT_wit ,  no NOT_charm ,  no NOT_humour .  not NOT_sexy NOT_in NOT_the NOT_least .  the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake .  there's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on .  when your lead (carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there .  despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach .  if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed . 
1043 1 this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages ,  especially for a war based (briefly) film .  basically it is a story based in two worlds ,  one obviously real ,  the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place .  anyway ,  peter carter (the great david niven) was going to crash in a plane ,  he talked to june (planet of the apes' kim hunter) before he bailed out and said he loved her .  he was meant to die from jumping without a parachute ,  but somehow he survived ,  and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh .  this other place ,  like a heaven ,  is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world ,  so they send french conductor 71 (marius goring) to persuade him to go ,  but he is obviously in love .  peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court ,  he is granted this .  obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other ,  june even offers to take his place! also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe ,  kathleen byron as an angel ,  a brief (then unknown) lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham sofaer as the judge/the surgeon .  david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actors ,  the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending ,  it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war films ,  it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british films ,  and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films .  outstanding! 
1044 0 about 15 minutes in ,  my wife was already wanting to leave .  not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_material ,  but the lack thereof .  they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could .  when this would let up (very rare) ,  we'd sit back and watch (not laughing ,  mind you) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark(s) .  after about 35 minutes ,  we both got up and left .  everything we'd read said how great this was .  the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it "intelligent" and said it wasn't NOT_a NOT_crude NOT_sex NOT_comedy .  did he go to the right movie? along with be cool ,  it's the only other movie i've ever walked out on .  .  . and i have no NOT_regrets .  i'm sick of trying to go see comedies in america . 
1045 1 a wonderful film by powell and pressburger ,  whose work i now want to explore more .  the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real ,  and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another .  beautifully shot and acted ,  although david niven doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_27 NOT_years NOT_old ,  as his character claims to be .  fun to see a very young richard attenborough .  this film made me think ,  while i was watching it ,  and afterwards . 
1046 0 it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today .  maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties ,  and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation ,  and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie ,  since so many people loved it .  i found it foul and vulgar .  i haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill .  the humor is sophomoric and crude .  i am not NOT_a NOT_politically NOT_correct NOT_person ,  and even i found the gay jokes ,  not NOT_only NOT_not NOT_funny NOT_but NOT_downright NOT_offensive NOT_( NOT_i'm NOT_not NOT_gay) .  the main character in the movie is not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_likable NOT_person ,  just pathetic .  when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see .

1048 0 "the 40 year old virgin" exists in a world i don't NOT_understand .  a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "f*** off" and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not NOT_get NOT_reprimanded .  a world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples' cars .  a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings .  a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities .  and a world without any funny jokes! i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie .  i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch - not NOT_very NOT_funny NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with ,  and stretched out beyond all rational thought .  the chest-waxing scene went on forever . <br /><br />the characters ,  aside from carell ,  were totally one-note .  and the romantic elements were completely contrived ,  particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell's apartment .  that was just lame . <br /><br />and i also found the "aquarius" sequence totally annoying and excessive .  i hated hated hated this movie! 
1049 1 i saw this movie years ago on late night television .  back then it went by the title of "stairway to heaven" .  even as a young boy ,  i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what i'm talking about) .  such imagination! a perfect blend of romance ,  drama ,  humour and fantasy ,  this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: citizen kane ,  casablanca ,  gone with the wind .  this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10 .  i was surprised it was not NOT_listed NOT_in NOT_the NOT_top NOT_250 NOT_films NOT_until NOT_i NOT_realized NOT_so NOT_few NOT_have NOT_seen/rated NOT_this NOT_movie ,  compared to those on the list .  what a pity .  i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 (north america) ,  so that 1) ,  i can purchase it ,  and 2) ,  others discover this hidden treasure . 
1050 0 i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented .  i mean ,  i hate to say bad things about an amateur production ,  but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it ,  tone it down a little .  "groundbreaking" is a little over the top .  this is a boston based college production that doesn't NOT_even NOT_achieve NOT_the NOT_level NOT_of NOT_most NOT_amateur NOT_college NOT_film .  it's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do .  a silly action film without much creativity .  it's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it .  not NOT_something NOT_you NOT_will NOT_ever NOT_see NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_are NOT_a NOT_student NOT_at NOT_emerson NOT_college . 
1051 1 just after the end of wwii powell & pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk & the usa .  at the time there was a lot of "overpaid ,  over sexed and over here" type of comments .  somehow they came up with this masterpiece . <br /><br />my favourite movie of all time .  it's got everything .  romance ,  poetry ,  emotion ,  religion ,  drama and very quirky . <br /><br />i can never NOT_explain NOT_exactly NOT_why ,  but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times (yes ,  really) i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout . <br /><br />was it the magnificent acting ,  the wonderful sets ,  the inspired script ? who knows .  but *do* watch it and you'll see what i mean . 
1052 0 almost as tedious to watch as it was to read ,  evening is a gorgeously produced failure .  .  . until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff .  vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher .  perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrã©e to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying .  <br /><br />i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas .  it gave me a headache . 
1053 1 if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form ,  you can do worse than pointing them at this movie . <br /><br />quite simply it is the perfect combination of story ,  script ,  actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid . <br /><br />the story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war ,  and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities (or is it in his head) is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot (niven) describes his plight to the ground radio operator (hunter) . <br /><br />the sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiff's photography and the incredible production designs . <br /><br />the supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic marius goring) . <br /><br />not only a highpoint in british cinema ,  but a highpoint in cinema ,  period . 
1054 0 cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less .  vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love .  .  . <br /><br />this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is .  not NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_such NOT_but NOT_with NOT_redgrave ,  toni collette ,  glenn close ,  meryl streep ,  clare danes , natasha richardson , eileen atkins ,  patrick wilson , hugh darcy and others (all giving fine performances) you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance . <br /><br />wait for cable . 
1055 1 it is no NOT_surprise NOT_that NOT_writer/director NOT_michael NOT_powell NOT_considered NOT_"a NOT_matter NOT_of NOT_life NOT_and NOT_death , " his and emeric pressburger's spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together .  released during the aftermath of world war 2 ,  this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised ,  recovering nation in need of a good uplift . <br /><br />following a string of other patriotic war films ,  'the archers' made this one their quirkiest ,  skittish and most patriotic of the lot .  quintessentially british for upholding british heritage (shakespeare ,  beer ,  fair play ,  good manners) ,  it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions ,  technical inventiveness and a fine multi-ethnic cast . <br /><br />oddly echoing another 1946 classic ,  "it's a wonderful life , " amolad opens on a grand firmament ,  with one of those jolly voice-overs preaching about the earth and the heavens ,  and what a big ,  wonderful world we live in .  <br /><br />it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit ,  badly hit ,  up in flames and with the co-pilot already dead .  it sounds misconceived ,  but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow . <br /><br />clocking in at nearly 5 minutes ,  the rapid-fire exchange between british pilot peter (david niven) and american radio contact june (kim hunter) is breathtaking in its intimacy .  resigned to dying ,  peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour ,  charm and outpouring confessions ,  and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of 'i love you . ' <br /><br />keeping with the magic of the moment ,  peter ,  by oversight of his conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'other world , ' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach .  he later encounters june riding a bicycle ,  and instantly matches the body with the voice .  <br /><br />but realising their error ,  the high court want peter sent back ,  and order the french conductor (maurice goring) down to earth to retrieve him .  but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductor's mistake ,  and wilfully guards his corner . <br /><br />peter's fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor (raymond massey) ,  whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates .  the surreal trial ,  which dissolves from b/w back into rich technicolor ,  once the verdict is announced ,  may well be a dream ,  but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome . <br /><br />the abstract ,  frame filling "stairway to heaven" (the american title of the film) is used twice: the first time in b/w ,  when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards ,  crossing giant statues of peter's potential attorneys for the trial ,  including abraham lincoln and plato .  the second time ,  the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema - peter and june frozen side-by-side ,  their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame ,  their fate sealed . <br /><br />the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never NOT_turns NOT_mushy NOT_or NOT_verbose; NOT_it's NOT_treated NOT_with NOT_nobility NOT_and NOT_the NOT_perception NOT_that NOT_the NOT_couple NOT_are NOT_already NOT_suitable NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_be NOT_married NOT_and NOT_simply NOT_need NOT_to NOT_convince NOT_people NOT_of NOT_their NOT_love ,  so it can keep them together .  <br /><br />the french conductor ,  who can freeze time and people's bodies ,  obtrudes many of their key moments together ,  lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks ,  pinching peter's 'top 100 game tricks' book and his coffee cup . <br /><br />as visually inspired as other powell/pressburger collaborations ,  this was the first time they combined colour with b/w â– the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes ,  and both are equally captivating .  <br /><br />the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design ,  with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn't NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_it NOT_was NOT_written NOT_or NOT_performed NOT_for NOT_the NOT_screen .  amusing and witty ,  powell/pressburger's writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition . <br /><br />made in 1946 ,  "a matter of life and death" is one of those films that defies it age ,  looking fresh and inventive ,  even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects ,  probably stripping them of their emotional wonder .  <br /><br />other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences .  powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame ,  giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peter's predicament .

1057 1 if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this isn't NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_should NOT_be NOT_viewed NOT_by NOT_a NOT_cynical NOT_audience NOT_and NOT_i NOT_guess NOT_a NOT_character NOT_being NOT_killed NOT_in NOT_literally NOT_the NOT_last NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_the NOT_war NOT_adds NOT_to NOT_the NOT_poignancy NOT_ .  in fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect  ,  beauty and soul of powell and pressburger's masterpiece  .  the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made  .  raf bomber command lost 58 , 000 men during the war  ,  the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far  ,  far smaller pool of active combatants  ,  there's no NOT_atheists NOT_in NOT_a NOT_fox NOT_hole NOT_and NOT_i NOT_doubt NOT_if NOT_you'd NOT_lost NOT_a NOT_relative NOT_during NOT_the NOT_conflict NOT_you'd NOT_view NOT_material NOT_atheism NOT_as NOT_being NOT_a NOT_sensible NOT_thing NOT_ .  when richar attenborough's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't NOT_survive NOT_the NOT_war NOT_ .  also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates  .  it's obvious nazis don't NOT_go NOT_to NOT_heaven NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>the NOT_plot NOT_itself NOT_where NOT_dashing NOT_young NOT_pilot NOT_peter NOT_carter NOT_arguing NOT_for NOT_his NOT_life NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_a NOT_celestial NOT_court NOT_wouldn't NOT_have NOT_had NOT_much NOT_appeal NOT_to NOT_me NOT_if NOT_it NOT_wasn't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_subtext NOT_ ,  you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it's replaced by american ambitions  .  there's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture  .  one is the ethnic mix of america  ,  even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51% of americans are " white european "  .  the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess " i am an american " as peter is judged by abraham farlan  ,  an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence  .  as for the " special relationship " between britain and america - what special relationship ? powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america  .  they obviously know their future too <br /><br />so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present  .  it's strange  ,  beautiful  ,  poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never NOT_ever NOT_work NOT_if NOT_it NOT_were NOT_made NOT_in NOT_the NOT_last NOT_40 NOT_years NOT_ .  can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq ? 
1058 0 this is ,  without a doubt ,  the most offensive "chick flick" i have seen in years ,  if not NOT_ever .  the writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody .  before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster ,  we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all of your problems ,  "performer types" are miserable messes ,  & musicians can't NOT_be NOT_good NOT_mothers NOT_unless NOT_they NOT_toss NOT_their NOT_dreams NOT_for NOT_a NOT_more NOT_conventional NOT_lifestyle .  what a waste of a talented cast & some great-looking sets & costumes .  when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life ,  she'll end up - shudder - "alone!" ,  i felt queasy .  i can't NOT_believe NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_made NOT_it NOT_to NOT_theatrical NOT_release .  it's the sort of fare one expects from those "women's" cable channels that i always pass right by when channel-surfing .  i am female and over 35 ,  so i should be part of this film's target audience ,  but boy ,  does "evening" miss its target . 
1059 1 this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced .  -- a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash ,  has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot ,  knowing that within minutes he will be dead .  for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven .  when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven ,  the man refuses and demands to have his "day in court" to argue his case .  the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life ,  that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person ,  one who deserved a chance to live on .  <br /><br />the "heavenly court" is a cinematic delight! the "announcement of the jury of peers" is a definite highlight .  the story ,  as fantastic as it seems ,  is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time .  the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "kleenex treatment" for most viewers .  this film is in my personal all-time favorite top 10 ,  it has my highest recommendation! 
1060 0 i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening ,  and i must say i was extremely disappointed .  and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role .  depending on what you think about danes ,  she was either horribly miscast ,  or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 razzie for worst actress .  i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her .  instead ,  she is completely unlikeable .  the other "great" actresses do an ok job ,  but certainly don't NOT_light NOT_up NOT_the NOT_screen .  out of all the "great" actresses in this movie ,  i'd say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson .  streep is barely in the picture ,  and only appears near the very end . <br /><br />horrible screenplay as well .  it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being "in character . " 
1061 1 the great talents of michael powell and emeric pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful "a matter of life and death" .  it was part of the recent tribute to mr .  powell that played at the walter reade in new york .  this film ,  in particular ,  shows us one of the best british films from that ,  or any other era . <br /><br />"a matter of life and death" has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff ,  a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera .  particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven ,  and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth .  this was quite a coup ,  and well ahead of its times .  the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film . <br /><br />much has been said in this forum about the film ,  so our comment will be about the great acting powell and pressberger got out of the large ,  distinguished cast ,  who responded magnificently to the directors' guidance . <br /><br />david niven ,  is peter ,  whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it .  this film marked one of the highlights in mr .  niven's career .  he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie .  kim hunter is surprisingly good as june ,  the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies .  as fate would have it ,  peter and june fall in love at first sight . <br /><br />some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence .  robert coote ,  is bob ,  the man who is admitted to heaven ,  but he is surprised his friend peter never NOT_made NOT_the NOT_trip NOT_with NOT_him .  an excellent star turn by marius goring ,  who as the conductor 71 steals the film .  mr .  goring ,  who had worked with the directors ,  is one of the best things in the movie .  also ,  roger livesey ,  as dr .  frank reeves ,  does one of the best appearances of his career ,  as well as raymond massey ,  who is seen as abraham farlan . <br /><br />"a matter of life and death" is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators . 
1062 0 with a cast list like this one ,  i expected far better .  venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed .  the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie .  the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death .  the thing is ,  she never NOT_tells NOT_her NOT_daughters NOT_anything NOT_except NOT_cryptic NOT_advice NOT_to NOT_be NOT_happy .  all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped .  i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary .  it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense ,  or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never NOT_ending NOT_romance NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story's NOT_main NOT_characters .  either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't NOT_work NOT_to NOT_create NOT_anything .  it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none .  i left wondering why good movies can't NOT_be NOT_written NOT_for NOT_women .  it really was a disappointment . 
1063 1 this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made .  i've seen this movie for the first time a week ago ,  since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleigh's the pilgrimage:<br /><br />give me my scallop-shell of quiet ,  my staff of faith to walk upon ,  my scrip of joy ,  immortal diet ,  my bottle of salvation ,  my gown of glory ,  hope's true gage; and thus i'll take my pilgrimage (â…)<br /><br />do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powell's and emeric pressuburger's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening? because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this movie . <br /><br />i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god: i beg your pardon ,  sir .  so ,  do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime? well ,  well you'll see: we've written directed and produced: i know where i'm going ,  colonel blimp ,  red shoesâ… do you think that enough sir? it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god ,  nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death .  the fact that other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not NOT_apparent NOT_to NOT_everybody ,  notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never NOT_done NOT_anything NOT_else NOT_that NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie . <br /><br />of course old-timers will be tempted to say: they don't NOT_do NOT_movies NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one NOT_any NOT_more .  they'll be partially mistaken; they didn't NOT_make NOT_movies NOT_like NOT_this NOT_in NOT_the NOT_past NOT_times NOT_either . <br /><br />i've have already quoted keats here ,  but i'll repeat his words: a thing of beauty is a joy forever .

1065 1 enchanting ,  romantic ,  innovative ,  and funny .  the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled ,  exceeding better known "death romances" such as ghost .  while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway ,  the joy is in the journey .  the moral of the tale ,  of course ,  is timeless: love conquers all .  but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur .  with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures ,  the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later ,  far into the cgi era . <br /><br />yet for all the cosmic scale ,  powell and pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level .  the wonderfully ,  determinedly romantic aspect of "stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: june's teardrop ,  preserved on a rose petal .  <br /><br />this film ,  like the story and the set itself ,  is one for the ages . 
1066 0 i knew that 'evening' was a girlie film ,  so i was expecting to be bored .  a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive . <br /><br />survive? yes .  i am still here ,  but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! i suppose that ,  for yanks ,  it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well ,  next to the beach ,  in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no NOT_apparent NOT_lawnmower .  if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film . <br /><br />there's a monty python film about a knight who just won't NOT_die .  he ends up a wriggling (why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis .  this film is also about a sort of living dead .  vanessa redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt .  she's not NOT_worried NOT_about NOT_having NOT_been NOT_a NOT_wide-eyed ,  breathless bimbo ,  but imagines herself a murderess . <br /><br />obviously ,  being a girlie film ,  there's a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy/heathcliff character .  i'm not NOT_a NOT_woofter ,  so i can't NOT_claim NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_good NOT_judge NOT_of NOT_such NOT_things ,  but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour .  he's a bloodless cypher . <br /><br />as you might gather ,  the main characters aren't NOT_much NOT_cop ,  but the minor ones manage ,  amazingly to be much worse .  there's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers .  fair enough ,  but it isn't NOT_the NOT_role NOT_of NOT_hamlet NOT_- NOT_why NOT_ham NOT_it NOT_up NOT_so NOT_badly? NOT_forgetting NOT_that NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_girlie NOT_film ,  i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't NOT_flatter NOT_him ,  but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it . <br /><br />i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it ,  see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head ,  just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage . <br /><br />apart from the obligatory wedding ,  there is only one piece of action .  you'd have thought that they'd have got it right .  sadly ,  though ,  the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there .  when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't NOT_know NOT_is NOT_nearby NOT_(but NOT_we NOT_do NOT_as NOT_the NOT_audience) .  if they don't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_clue NOT_that NOT_the NOT_person NOT_is NOT_within NOT_a NOT_couple NOT_of NOT_miles NOT_of NOT_the NOT_place ,  then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? i suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence .  .  . <br /><br />another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan .  i didn't NOT_think NOT_that NOT_the NOT_technology NOT_to NOT_do NOT_this NOT_was NOT_developed NOT_until NOT_the NOT_fifties . 
1067 1 i love this movie .  director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie ,  and it is mine as well .  powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple ,  superbly crafted story - the power of love against "the powers that be" .  however ,  its deception lies in the complexity of its "is it real or is it imaginary" premise .  basically ,  one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young ,  poetically inclined airman during wwii .  or is it? the question is never NOT_answered NOT_one NOT_way NOT_or NOT_the NOT_other .  actually ,  it is never NOT_even NOT_asked .  this continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal . <br /><br />the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers .  for instance ,  pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss' opera ,  der rosenkavalier ,  about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat .  this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 ,  dressed in all his finery ,  holds the rose (which appears silver in heaven) .  the music even has a dreamy quality . <br /><br />all of the acting is first rate - david niven is at his most charming ,  and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter .  but ,  in my opinion ,  the film's charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 .  he by far has the most interesting role ,  filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness ,  brightening the film .  it's a pity that some of conductor 71's scenes were left on the cutting room floor .  it is also a pity that goring's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film ,  except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s .  this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career .  he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven ,  and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters .  ironically ,  also in the mid -1940s ,  niven also starred against another heavenly "messenger" ,  played by cary grant ,  in the bishop's wife .  their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring ,  unenergetic ,  and disappointing .  as a note ,  according to powell ,  goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter ,  initially refusing conductor 71 .  it's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal . <br /><br />the movie ,  "commissioned" to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the u . s .  ,  overdrives its point towards the end .  but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties ,  both military and civilian ,  the need to "go on" when faced with death .  there is a conspicuous lack of wwii "enemies" in heaven ,  but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin .  powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't NOT_necessary .  the movie may not NOT_have NOT_served NOT_its NOT_diplomatic NOT_purpose NOT_as NOT_was NOT_hoped NOT_for ,  but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic . 
1068 0 this crap is like watching paint dry .  i'm so disappointed because i was so eager to see it . <br /><br />there simply is no NOT_meaning NOT_to NOT_this NOT_film .  if it were never NOT_made ,  no NOT_one NOT_would NOT_notice NOT_or NOT_care .  it's hyped up because of all the big names in it ,  but if "nobody's" were in ,  nobody would give this film any love . <br /><br />seriously ,  i was at the point where half-way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think ,  "hurry up and die already!" this is like the "joy luck club" without any of the friggin' joy .  it's the "ocean's 13" (nothing but a big-named cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic .  .  . oh until it's finally over . <br /><br />i'm sure they'll all be nominated for oscars .  .  . <br /><br />- 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk . 
1069 1 the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the archers' logo ,  the introductory disclaimer ,  the way the camera pans over the cosmos .  it's strange to think that `it's a wonderful life' came out in the same year .  no NOT_great NOT_coincidence: NOT_the NOT_1940s NOT_was NOT_awash NOT_with NOT_heaven-and-earth NOT_films; NOT_but NOT_the NOT_glowing NOT_cotton NOT_wool NOT_nebulas NOT_and NOT_cutesy NOT_angels NOT_of NOT_the NOT_competition NOT_look NOT_tattered ,  something best passed over in silence ,  when placed next to alfred junge's vision . <br /><br />it continues to look great all the way through ,  as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us .  i'm not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_mixing NOT_colour NOT_with NOT_black NOT_and NOT_white NOT_in NOT_general .  one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other .  not NOT_so NOT_here .  powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world ,  a mere change of palettes .  both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own . <br /><br />as for the story  .  .  .  this may be pressburger's best script ,  or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events .  other than that it's tight ,  yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here .  was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary? (or both? perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was ,  as it so happened ,  true . ) everyone says we're meant to neither ask nor answer this question ,  but i don't NOT_see NOT_why .  i'm sure we are meant to ask the question .  the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed ,  the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions .  the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn't NOT_mean NOT_that NOT_this NOT_shouldn't NOT_occupy NOT_us NOT_as NOT_well .  there is ,  as i've said before ,  a lot going on . <br /><br />consider the scene in which abraham farlan (heaven's prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match ,  and contemptuously says ,  `the voice of england ,  1945 . ' dr .  reeves (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment ,  and then produces one of his own: a blues song from america ,  which farlan listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth .  reeves looks smug . <br /><br />snobbery? well ,  i don't NOT_see NOT_why NOT_it's NOT_snobbish NOT_to NOT_condemn NOT_blues NOT_music NOT_- NOT_and NOT_that's NOT_not NOT_what NOT_powell NOT_and NOT_pressburger NOT_are NOT_doing ,  anyway .  as the song is being played ,  we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it: several of them nod their heads to the rhythm ,  perfectly at home .  they don't NOT_find NOT_it NOT_incomprehensible .  there's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is .  reeves probably realises as much .  all english audiences (and all australian ,  indian ,  etc .  audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast ,  too; and that while reeves understands that ,  he is unable to explain it to farlan - hence the blues broadcast ,  which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else .  it's a clever scene . <br /><br />one last thing .  i found david niven a bit cold ,  without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so ,  i don't NOT_think NOT_a NOT_film NOT_has NOT_grabbed NOT_my NOT_heart NOT_quite NOT_so NOT_quickly NOT_after NOT_the NOT_action NOT_began ,  as this one did .

NOT_i NOT_was NOT_apologizing NOT_to NOT_my NOT_boyfriend NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_movie .  <br /><br />it was so slow and awfully strange .  <br /><br />both redgraves , vanessa and natasha were unfit for this ,  especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent .  <br /><br />claire danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl that she was in my so-called life .  she has yet to push herself in any way .  girl ,  find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /><br />meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie ,  she was on screen for five minutes ,  and i swear to god ,  she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake .  <br /><br />oh! and hugh dancy ,  who gets better every time i see him .  <br /><br />glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes .  <br /><br />i mean ,  this was a well-shot movie ,  it was very pretty ,  the settings were interestingly dressed ,  providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling .  <br /><br />i don't NOT_know ,  it's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of "the greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much .  it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors ,  and the main character (ann) was a huge jerk .  i was glad she died .  but that's because i felt bad for lila ,  ann's friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy .  <br /><br />ugh .  bad job ,  evening the film .  you weren't NOT_entertaining NOT_and NOT_you NOT_weren't NOT_even NOT_thought-provoking .  i sure hope the book was better ,  so it didn't NOT_waste NOT_even NOT_more NOT_of NOT_people's NOT_time .  3/10 
1071 1 a matter of life and death ,  what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film .  powell and pressburger's visual imagination knows no NOT_bounds ,  every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions .  the switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious ,  showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is .  the final court scene is also fantastic ,  as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter (david niven)'s operation .  <br /><br />all of the performances are spot on (roger livesey being a standout) ,  and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful ,  never NOT_has NOT_there NOT_been NOT_a NOT_more NOT_romantic NOT_film NOT_than NOT_this NOT_(if NOT_there NOT_has NOT_i NOT_haven't NOT_seen NOT_it) .  a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is .  and jack cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone ,  the way he lights kim hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful ,  what a genius ,  he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting .  and the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />this is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema ,  under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences ,  but one of my all time favourites ,  which is why i give this film a 10/10 ,  in a word - beautiful . 
1072 0 the story of a woman (ann) on her death bed ,  her two daughters (nina and constance) and her thoughts about her past .  the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila .  at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life .  through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love .  her daughter constance is older ,  more "responsible , " a mother of two and has things together .  nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life . <br /><br />first of all the good .  the period detail in the movie is great .  the dresses ,  hair ,  cars ,  houses ,  etc .  really put you in another time and place .  and there is some very quality acting in the movie .  vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end .  claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer) .  hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila's brother buddy . <br /><br />now for the bad ,  which unfortunately is everything else .  things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us .  the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great .  they have fun and dance .  then .  .  .  you are supposed to believe that she doesn't NOT_really NOT_like NOT_him NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_friend NOT_and NOT_that NOT_his NOT_pining NOT_only NOT_annoys NOT_her .  and i thought the whole ,  "he might be gay" thing was out of the blue and didn't NOT_serve NOT_a NOT_purpose . <br /><br />then we have harris .  the character acts wooden and creepy .  had this been another genre ,  you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go .  it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so (but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out) . <br /><br />and the grandest problem of all .  why don't NOT_ann NOT_and NOT_harris NOT_get NOT_together?

1073 1 few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later ,  yet remain as engrossing as this one .  technological advances have not NOT_dated NOT_this NOT_classic NOT_love NOT_story .  special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie .  the acting is superb .  david niven ,  kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job .  the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie .  it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence .  it is my favorite movie of all time .  waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is ,  in itself ,  "a matter of life and death" . 
1074 0 i went to see "evening" because of the cast .  i'd gone to see "norman's room" for that reason -- that movie offering diane keaton ,  leonardo de caprio and ,  also ,  meryl streep -- and had loved every minute of it .  same for "the notebook" even though it was chick-flit lite .  and my feeling was ,  anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave ,  meryl streep ,  patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good .  instead ,  i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite ,  simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material . <br /><br />now i had no NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_the NOT_way NOT_the NOT_film NOT_was NOT_structured .  i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story .  .  . so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse .  but while vanessa's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt "was a mistake" was riveting ,  at times ,  the part actually showing what that "past mistake" was does nothing to clarify the matter .  in fact ,  it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest "girl meets boy ,  girl gets boy ,  girl loses boy" fashion ,  and in the most unbelievable ,  clichã©d ,  wrong-headed way possible . <br /><br />and from here be spoilers ,  so bear that in mind should you continue reading . <br /><br />first of all ,  claire danes was brutally miscast .  not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_she NOT_not NOT_even NOT_begin NOT_to NOT_resemble NOT_vanessa NOT_redgrave NOT_as NOT_a NOT_young NOT_woman ,  she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting .  don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong ,  she can be good in the right role -- just not NOT_this NOT_one .  and patrick wilson was miscast ,  though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off .  he'd have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played -- the rich confused wasp -- and not NOT_the NOT_object NOT_of NOT_sexual NOT_attraction NOT_to NOT_one NOT_and NOT_all; NOT_he's NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_too NOT_wasp-y NOT_for NOT_that .  hugh dancy? one note -- "i'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why . " and the "why" (i'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world ,  so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died (as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties) so ludicrous ,  wrong-headed and mishandled ,  i nearly threw my candy at the screen . <br /><br />as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister ,  her fear of commitment ,  her jealousy of her sister's "perfect life , " her sister wondering if she's made the right choices ,  her pregnancy and her too-perfect boyfriend (which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson ,  and ebon moss-bachrach might have been a more interesting harris ,  given his dreamy eyes) -- anyway ,  all this was hashed over in the 70's and 80's .  and in much greater depth .  do we really have to present it ,  again ,  and all as if it was fresh and momentous?<br /><br />and to top it off ,  meryl streep doesn't NOT_even NOT_appear NOT_until NOT_the NOT_last NOT_ten NOT_minutes NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie ,  all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions .  she's still good ,  but only because she's meryl ,  and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup . <br /><br />so to put it simply ,  this movie has every clichã© in the "really meaningful message" movie book ,  and it adds a few that really had no NOT_business NOT_being NOT_trotted NOT_out ,  again .  at two hours long and laced with "lifetime movie-of-the-week" music that is guaranteed to rub you raw ,  it's a complete failure in both the "meaningful" and "moviemaking" aspects .  i give it "3" only because of meryl and vanessa . <br /><br />now ,  if all you require from your films is twadd le ,  then please set my comments about "evening" aside and have the time of your life .  but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings ,  rent "norman's room" and find out what truly great acting is . 
1075 1 to me a matter of life and death is just that- simply the best film ever made . <br /><br />from beginning to end it oozes class .  it is stimulating ,  thought provoking ,  a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples . <br /><br />the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly .  the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy . <br /><br />no matter how many times i watch the film - and i have watched it a lot - it never NOT_fails NOT_to NOT_touch NOT_me .  it makes me smile ,  it makes me laugh ,  it makes me think ,  it makes me cry .  it is as fresh today as it was in 1946 . <br /><br />if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film . 
1076 0 wow ,  what a waste of acting talent .  my husband and i sat there ,  both thinking ,  this has to get better ,  these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap .  unattractive characters ,  hackneyed script ,  and listless pacing make for a long two hours .  i actually couldn't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping (cat litter being more appealing than this film) .  the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't NOT_get NOT_better--by NOT_the NOT_time NOT_buddy NOT_is NOT_killed ,  you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives .  it would be infinitely more entertaining .  beautiful scenery and costumes can't NOT_keep NOT_this NOT_one NOT_alive . 
1077 1 return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original .  it had black humor ,  good suspense ,  nice looking girls ,  and of course ,  a psycho killer .  what are we missing? i think nothing .  except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television .  besides being one of the best sequels ,  it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family .  recommended for everyone . 
1078 0 around the late 1970's ,  animator don bluth ,  frustrated with the output his company ,  disney was churning ,  defected from the mouse house to form his own studio .  his first production ,  the secret of nimh ,  was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day .  this was followed by an american tail and the land before time ,  both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful .  although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh ,  they still are very charming ,  enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups .  but before long ,  don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven; critics were especially harsh on this film ,  and matters weren't NOT_helped NOT_by NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_it NOT_opened NOT_alongside NOT_disney's NOT_the NOT_little NOT_mermaid . <br /><br />considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title ,  one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare .  instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling ,  deceit ,  crime ,  mistreatment ,  and murder .  that itself is not NOT_a NOT_problem NOT_for NOT_an NOT_animated NOT_feature NOT_per NOT_say ,  but it does call into question over whether the film is for children .  on the other hand ,  it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven .  in short ,  it's a movie with a major identity crisis . <br /><br />set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans ,  the movie starts out when charlie b .  barkin ,  a rough-and-tumble german shepherd ,  is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner ,  a nasty ,  cigar-puffing pitbull ,  carface .  before you know it ,  charlie finds himself in heaven ,  albeit by default .  here a whippet angel ,  annabelle ,  tells him that "all dogs go to heaven because unlike people ,  dogs are usually loyal and kind . " this line represents the confused nature of the movie ,  since the dogs in the movie ,  the whippet aside ,  are presented as anything but . <br /><br />upon realizing that he's been murdered ,  charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface .  with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy ,  charlie "rescues" carface's prize ,  annemarie ,  a human girl who can talk to animals (in order to predict who will win the rat races) .  charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family ,  but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down .  although he refuses to admit it ,  charlie does grow to love annemarie .  .  . <br /><br />the concept of the story isn't NOT_as NOT_problematic NOT_as NOT_the NOT_execution .  aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes of ken page) ,  none of the other characters emerge as likable ,  nor frankly ,  are even worth caring about .  unfortunately ,  that also applies to charlie; in trying to make him an anti-hero ,  the script (composed by more than ten writers) only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable .  as such ,  the audience feels no NOT_empathy NOT_for NOT_charlie ,  and worse ,  his redemption at the end of the movie does not NOT_come NOT_across NOT_as NOT_convincing .  (further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds . ) besides the lack of an endearing lead ,  the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story .  the slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no NOT_purpose NOT_but NOT_to NOT_pad NOT_out NOT_the NOT_movie's NOT_running NOT_time .  the aforementioned musical alligator (who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere ,  as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza .  the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter ,  impactful story . <br /><br />matters are not NOT_helped NOT_by NOT_the NOT_lackluster NOT_musical NOT_numbers NOT_by NOT_charlie NOT_strouse NOT_and NOT_t . j .  kuenster (annemarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from ken page's mellifluous vocal) or the uneven voice cast .  as mentioned ,  burt reynolds' stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end) .  dom deluise as itchy is pretty good ,  but he's had better roles ,  notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh .  ken page ,  as mentioned ,  is awesome in anything he does ,  but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best .  similarly wasted are loni anderson (as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie) ,  melba moore ,  and charles nelson reilly .  judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable ,  partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show . <br /><br />barsi aside ,  the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation .  technically ,  this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth's team (by 1980's standards ,  that is) ,  particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon .  if anything ,  the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling . <br /><br />on the whole ,  however ,  i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment .  even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion ,  the overall package is not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_same NOT_league NOT_as NOT_bluth's NOT_better NOT_efforts .  animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry ,  but by the time it's over ,  all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth . 
1079 1 the first was good and original .  i was a not NOT_bad NOT_horror/comedy NOT_movie .  so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it . <br /><br />what really makes this movie work is judd nelson's character and the sometimes clever script .  a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay .  sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look . <br /><br />great made-for-tv movie .  it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson's stanley doing what he does best . <br /><br />i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel ,  just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background . 
1080 0 all for love ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleon`s army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison  .  there`s also a storyline involving a murder  . <br /><br />i will be honest and confess that i wasn`t too taken by the movie since i`m not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_period NOT_dramas NOT_and NOT_the NOT_screenplay NOT_feels NOT_somewhat NOT_episodic NOT_but NOT_i NOT_will NOT_say NOT_that NOT_this NOT_is NOT_well NOT_acted NOT_by NOT_everyone NOT_involved NOT_and NOT_it`s NOT_got NOT_a NOT_good NOT_cast NOT_that NOT_features NOT_miranda NOT_richardson NOT_ ,  anna friel  ,  richard e grant  ,  michael gough and jason isaacs  .  the costume design as you can expect is also excellent <br /><br />i`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime  .  captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_a NOT_murder NOT_scene NOT_where NOT_blood NOT_is NOT_clearly NOT_seen NOT_ .  you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing 
1081 1 actually .  .  .  that "video camera" effect ,  is just that ,  it's an effect ,  a rather good one .  .  (u don't NOT_know NOT_much NOT_about NOT_directing NOT_a NOT_film NOT_do NOT_you?) NOT_this NOT_film NOT_is NOT_in NOT_fact NOT_better NOT_than NOT_the NOT_original ,  it's great fun to watch ,  made for tv ,  doesn't NOT_need NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_any NOT_rules .  i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl ,  its disturbing .  and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it ,  we as the viewers are on his side .  i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it .  watching this film you can understand how real movies are made ,  as this is sort of like a film within a film .  judd is one of the scariest villains ever ,  and he's more realistic ,  he doesn't NOT_just NOT_mindlessly NOT_chop NOT_people NOT_up NOT_like NOT_in NOT_other NOT_horrors . 
1082 0 i found this film to be quite an oddity .  from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie ,  and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why .  jean-marc barr ,  although i love him to bits (i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here ,  and although i can't NOT_figure NOT_for NOT_the NOT_life NOT_of NOT_me NOT_who NOT_would NOT_be NOT_better ,  i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work .  everything else is fine ,  except for the stabs at weak comedy (a meet the parents joke is not NOT_really NOT_needed ,  filmmakers!) and i really like richard e .  grant as the british major .  it just suffers from one thing .  .  jean-marc . 
1083 1 as a sequel , this is not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie . i actually liked it better than the 1st one . i found it more entertaining . it seemed like it was shot documentary style . at first this bothered me , as i thought it just looked too low budget . but it grew on me , and it made the movie seem more authentic . this movie has more dry one liners than the original , which is a good thing , in my opinion . i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters . it almost becomes a parody of itself , which may be the point . this movie at least has some suspense , which the 1st one did not NOT_have , in my view . it has some of the same great music from the original , which is great . the acting again was pretty decent for the most part , though like i said , some of it seemed over the top . i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_flow , like the rest of the movie . overall , though , i thought this was a pretty sequel . my rating for "return to cabin by the lake" is 7/10* 
1084 0 first of all there is gujarati theatre then there is bollywood .  both have their strengths and fan following .  director vipul shah should look elsewhere instead of gujarati theatre when making a bollywood production .  first he made aankhen (adapted from a gujarati play) - which had a unique plot ,  but could not NOT_hold NOT_as NOT_a NOT_hindi NOT_film .  now he's adapted another gujarati play and named it waqt - a race against time .  in sum ,  the emotions are alien .  the plot development is not NOT_for NOT_hindi NOT_films .  for example ,  the role play between father and son is best left to gujarati theatre - don't NOT_bring NOT_it NOT_in NOT_a NOT_hindi NOT_film .  even the comedy track is best left for the gujarati stage .  all performances are average - nothing to shout about - barring shefali chhaya shah who is fantastic . 
1085 1 when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie ,  i wanted to watch .  it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it .  so i had even more reason to watch .  well ,  i watched .  it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies .  i hate what happens to brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and i didn't NOT_like NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters ,  brian's one included .  but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make stanley caldwell (judd nelson) shine once more .  at the end ,  i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending .  if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood ,  i'd suggest you watch this . 
1086 0 well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast  .  . i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not NOT_know NOT_who? NOT_some NOT_pathetic NOT_songs NOT_that NOT_will NOT_be NOT_heard NOT_by NOT_who? NOT_some NOT_pathetically NOT_abrupt NOT_turnings NOT_justified NOT_by NOT_who? NOT_race NOT_against NOT_time? NOT_u NOT_mean NOT_waste NOT_against NOT_time? NOT_ok NOT_so NOT_first NOT_you NOT_spoil NOT_your NOT_kid , then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway! 
1087 1 this movie is the best horror movie ,  bar-none . i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake . i have been a fan of judd nelson's work for many years ,  and he blew me away .  its a blend of horror ,  and drama  , and romance ,  not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_comedy .  his evil ,  yet charming look captured me right then and there .  that look in his eyes ,  i will never NOT_forget .  there's something about him ,  i cant describe . 
1088 0 pros: akshay kumar's performance(is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump ab in their movies together?) .  some touching scenes in the 2nd half . <br /><br />cons: the whole 1st hour(the jokes were flat to say the least) .  every scene involving rajpal yadav .  major stupidity in ab's decision making .  let me get this straight ,  he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way(that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth?? wtf? he considers akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer ,  but thinks insulting him will make him stronger? am i the only one who doesn't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_logic NOT_here? NOT_easily NOT_the NOT_movie's NOT_biggest NOT_flaw . <br /><br />- akshay becoming a stunt man .  lmao!! we're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in mba .  but when the time arrives to support himself ,  and his pregnant wife ,  he becomes a stunt man .  lol!! how abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field? or heck ,  anywhere else where ur life isn't NOT_in NOT_danger? NOT_this NOT_is NOT_some NOT_incredibly NOT_dumb NOT_writing . <br /><br />- the ending .  i hate this sort of melodramatic crap .  everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for ab's character ,  which i couldn't .  the entire thing reminded me a little too much of srk in khnh(which i hate) .  this "please feel sorry for the guy with the illness" crap has run its course .  i felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man .  couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd .  the whole thing . <br /><br />bottomline: waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie .  its obvious director vipul shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense .  give 'em some decent song picturizations ,  fancy outfits ,  plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap-up crap like this . 
1089 1 i loved this movie .  it was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake) ,  only instead of just killing women ,  he kills men also .  and the scenes are much more interesting ,  2 of my favorite scenes are firstly ,  when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly's last moments before she is thrown to the water ,  and secondly ,  when stanley is visiting allison in his basement ,  right before they head down to the set ,  when she kisses him .  those scenes ,  for me ,  were very intense and riveting .  i gave the movie a rating of 8/10 ,  not NOT_because NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_bad ,  but because the filming was bad ,  i mean ,  there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong ,  like its being shot the way a film is usually shot ,  you wouldn't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_"live" NOT_camera NOT_shooting ,  but then ,  very little ,  you would notice the filming mistakes .  what went wrong?? 
1090 0 this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema ,  as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry ,  however it also the worst . <br /><br />how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage .  take a look at russia ,  iran ,  china and latin america ,  look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna!!<br /><br />get real people ,  no NOT_wonder NOT_the NOT_international NOT_community NOT_in NOT_general NOT_laughs NOT_at NOT_indian NOT_cinema . 
1091 1 sequels hardly ever live up to the original .  this definitely proves true in this case .  however ,  if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch .  although the camera work is lacking ,  brian krause's character is annoying ,  and the plot is clique ,  it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it .  <br /><br />don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film .  quite frankly it's a bit different .  rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays ,  stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project ,  cabin by the lake .  this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action . <br /><br />i'm giving it a 6 out of 10 . 
1092 0 those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar .  i know bollywood films do not NOT_really NOT_strive NOT_to NOT_be NOT_realistic NOT_but NOT_please NOT_a NOT_walt NOT_disney NOT_production NOT_is NOT_more NOT_realistic NOT_than NOT_this NOT_plot .  the father is dying and does what any good parent does .  .  . kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife .  a few things that were too hard to swallow- 1 .  priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2 .  akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man ,  gets bitten by rabified dogs ,  to then just walk off .  this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it ,  we left the cinema with a frown ,  please do not NOT_subject NOT_yourself NOT_to NOT_this NOT_mess NOT_to NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_take NOT_my NOT_advice NOT_and NOT_do NOT_not NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_'waqt' . 
1093 1 i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while .  sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die ,  stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant .  it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died .  my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird .  judd nelson is cute ,  at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell .  brilliant movie . 
1094 0 this movie's full title is "waqt: race against time" .  that's a race no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_ever NOT_win ,  but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not NOT_wasting NOT_any NOT_of NOT_your NOT_precious NOT_"waqt" NOT_on NOT_this NOT_bakvaas .  this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest .  it strained my credulity too far .  it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline ,  and deserves to be mocked for it . <br /><br />it's not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_awful NOT_as NOT_baghban NOT_or NOT_black ,  but this movie has nothing to recommend it .  stupid ,  pointless ,  with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji .  the central "plot" is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many "family" bw films .  if my father ,  who raised me ,  and who i love dearly ,  treated me like big b did akshay ,  i'd shoot him myself .  to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness . 
1095 1 i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_i'm NOT_just NOT_weird ,  but i thoroughly enjoyed this film .  <br /><br />return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake .  in fact ,  i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one .  i also thought that the cast in this movie was great ,  judd nelson is always the best! i also enjoyed the plot as a whole .  i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley's screenplay cabin by the lake- it wasn't NOT_a NOT_completely NOT_redundant NOT_film NOT_of NOT_stanley NOT_grabbing NOT_other NOT_girls NOT_and NOT_drowning NOT_them .  - if you're looking for some deep meaning ,  then this film is probably not NOT_the NOT_one NOT_for NOT_you .  however ,  if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours ,  then go ahead and watch it .  i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film .  :) 
1096 0 i saw the 7 . 5 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented .  she said she had seen it before .  "it's funny and sad! i cried the first time i saw it , " she gushed .  maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 7 . 5 out of 10 ,  but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime ,  this deserves no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_3 .  any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no NOT_good NOT_for NOT_me .  the characters are unbelievable ,  how the act is not NOT_realistic NOT_at NOT_all NOT_and NOT_their NOT_motives NOT_are NOT_contrived .  it is over dramatic and the songs aren't NOT_all NOT_that NOT_great .  my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety .  all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_realistic .  any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song .  i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song .  the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not NOT_funny NOT_or NOT_necessary NOT_(we NOT_get NOT_it ,  laxman isn't NOT_the NOT_sharpest NOT_tool NOT_in NOT_the NOT_shed) .  if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn't NOT_meaningful ,  just a bit embarrassing . <br /><br />*****spoiler*****<br /><br />generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told .  too many plot holes to count .  at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who don't NOT_watch NOT_them NOT_that NOT_avidly NOT_but NOT_it NOT_just NOT_got NOT_tedious .  it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not NOT_having NOT_all NOT_the NOT_amusing NOT_parts NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_half NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_all NOT_the NOT_heartwrenching NOT_parts NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end . <br /><br />*****spoiler over***** perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen ,  but not NOT_much NOT_at NOT_all .  i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny .  i didn't NOT_shed NOT_a NOT_single NOT_tear NOT_nor NOT_did NOT_i NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_it ,  rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending .  i don't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_if NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_something NOT_good ,  i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad . 
1097 1 this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur ,  and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river .  this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along .  it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder .  he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge .  stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back .  as the movie goes along it's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur .  it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska .  this is one of stewart's better westerns . 
1098 0 i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such third-rate dross as waqt .  for starters ,  the storyline is totally implausible â– spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self-sufficiency .  so what does he do? he promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (i honestly am not NOT_joking NOT_here) .  in the meantime ,  his dad is dying of lung cancer ,  but keeps it a secret from the son ,  but he survives long enough to see his son become famous ,  to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands . <br /><br />the acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess â– no NOT_effort NOT_was NOT_made NOT_to NOT_try NOT_and NOT_act NOT_in NOT_any NOT_convincing NOT_manner NOT_by NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_main NOT_players NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  as usual for indian films ,  the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world . <br /><br />to be honest ,  the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film .  the actors ,  such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar ,  will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood . 
1099 1 the year is 1896 . jeff webster (james stewart) doesn't NOT_like NOT_people . there's only one friend he's got and he's ben tatum (walter brennan) ,  an old sympathetic man . they're driving a cattle herd with them . that would be their key to richness . in skagway they run into trouble when sheriff gannon (john mcintire) takes the cattle . now jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the u . s .  canadian border to dawson . now they have a group of other people with them ,  like the ladies ronda castle (ruth roman) and renee vallon (corinne calvet) . there the two men get into the gold business . anthony mann's and james stewart's fourth collaboration ,  the far country (1954) is a fine western ,  indeed . the acting work is superb . walter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewart . ruth roman is brilliant and corinne calvet's delightful . jay c .  flippen is very good as dawson marshal rube morris . the great jack elam and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller roles . it's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way . there's just the man and his rifle . but also he's vulnerable .

1101 1 this is such a fantastic movie ,  a western about a self-concerned man (jimmy stewart) going up to the klondike for gold .  on the way ,  he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska (john mcintire ,  giving a wonderfully evil performance) ,  whom he hassles back .  mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town ,  which is ,  unfortunately ,  the only way back to the states .  the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire's town .  ruth roman ,  for instance ,  who has come with stewart and his two companions (jay c .  flippen and walter brennen ,  who plays stewart's best friend) ,  builds a saloon (a hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business .  she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up ,  too .  in 1953 ,  jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre ,  the naked spur .  the far country is just the tiniest bit less ,  and it contains 99 . 9% of what made that film so special without ,  of course ,  feeling like a cheap copy .  like the naked spur ,  the far country boasts beautiful ,  on-location cinematography .  the landscape is gorgeous .  stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 ,  rear window) .  i suppose it could be considered cliche ,  as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end .  still ,  stewart plays it so damn well ,  he makes this character very human .  and the supporting performances are universally fantastic .  in addition to those i've mentioned ,  the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good .  and i ought to single out walter brennen ,  as well .  he seems to have specialized in playing best friends .  his relationship with stewart is very touching ,  since he is ,  at first ,  the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man .  the screenplay is very well written ,  and mann's direction is impeccable .  a masterpiece .  10/10 . 
1102 0 i've been going through the afi's list of the top 100 comedies ,  and i must say that this is truly one of the worst .  not NOT_just NOT_of NOT_the NOT_90 NOT_movies NOT_on NOT_the NOT_list NOT_i've NOT_seen ,  but of any movie i've ever seen .  drunks are funny sometimes ,  dudley isn't .  liza almost made it worthwhile ,  but alas .  .  .  just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good .  seriously ,  dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afi's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this .  if you want to see a funnier "drunk" ,  try the thin man .  funnier movie in general ,  any marx brothers movie will kill (especially if you're as drunk as arthur) . 
1103 1 the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart ,  this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska ,  via seattle .  he hooks up in seattle with his partners ben tatum (walter brennan) and rube morris (jay c .  flippen) that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip ,  north . <br /><br />but first ,  he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands ,  cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy ,  manipulative ronda castle (ruth roman) who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future .  that's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand . <br /><br />jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon (john mcintire) who runs the town of skagway ,  alaska .  gannon locks jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town .  he fines jeff the ownership of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being .  <br /><br />in the meantime ,  jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies .  but this is just a ruse so jeff ,  ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back .  of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of gannon's reach . <br /><br />after avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other skagway men ,  they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder ,  which just happens to be ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson .  jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold .  <br /><br />but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there ,  and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with skagway and wants to try his luck up in the klondike ,  himself .  that involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims .  jeff and ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good ,  leaving rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against gannon and his gang . <br /><br />they look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by gannon's men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth .  ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't NOT_save NOT_judge NOT_gannon NOT_from NOT_his NOT_just NOT_due .  the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that .  first jeff kills two of gannon's best gunman (jack elam and robert wilkie) .  then as ronda comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him ,  gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in jeff's arms .  then jeff kills gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk .  revenge has spoken . <br /><br />this is another rip-roaring western that's right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie .  why the universal dvd uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses ,  is beyond me .  you'll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels .  so if you like well-written 50s westerns ,  then this one's an a-list keeper .  <br /><br />8 out of 10 
1104 0 i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore .  it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already ,  and then it hit me .  .  .  .  . there's nothing new here! i've heard that joke on seinfeld ,  i saw someone fall like that on friends ,  an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ,  ect .  none of the actors are interesting here either! some were good on other shows (not here) ,  and others are new to a profession they should have never NOT_entered .  avoid this stinker! 
1105 1 now ,  admittedly ,  i'm no NOT_ardent NOT_student NOT_of NOT_the NOT_genre .  as a matter of fact ,  i've tended always to shy away from westerns because ,  in spite of all their critical cachet as america's primal stories (or whatever) ,  they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either "shoot up the injuns , " "the big gunfight , " or "hey ,  let's form a posse!" in other words ,  it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention ,  that it left precious little room for surprise or originality .  (and yes ,  i have seen at least some of the so-called "greats" ,  and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment - including stagecoach ,  rio bravo ,  my darling clementine ,  and of course the infamous [but profoundly dull] clint eastwood-sergio leone teamups in the '60s . )<br /><br />but when i saw this movie on tv - as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death - i finally got it: i understood ,  at least in theory ,  what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation (aside from just action and thrills) .  it is the push-pull between lawlessness and order; the american west represented freedom ,  but also the prospect of the wild ,  the untamed .  respectable folk could get hurt out there .  which ,  of course ,  meant that perhaps - just perhaps - it wasn't NOT_meant NOT_for NOT_respectable NOT_folk ,  and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty ,  those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers ,  and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land .  in such an environment ,  of course ,  the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free-spirited enough to be out there in the first place (and so reject "society , " at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard) ,  and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not NOT_right .  catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is ,  i believe (after seeing this movie) ,  the highest and truest goal of any western .  sadly ,  it is so often not NOT_the NOT_case ,  as the white hats are completely white ,  the black ones completely black (and let's not NOT_even NOT_get NOT_started NOT_talking NOT_about NOT_the NOT_indians ,  ok) and there is precious little shades of gray in between . <br /><br />not in this one .  jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold .  he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy ,  played by walter brennan (perhaps the western clichã© character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here ,  as always) - and no NOT_one NOT_else .  pointedly ,  they are out for themselves ,  and while stewart displays his patented charm (come on ,  we could never NOT_really NOT_dislike NOT_the NOT_guy ,  now could we?) ,  we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self-centered ,  self-interested character: none of his "gosh" or "oh golly gee" humanism is allowed to come through .  or ,  rather ,  it has to be earned ,  by the end of the picture ,  in the way i described above .  he must confront the lawlessness in himself ,  and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners' starting point on their gold dust trail .  this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff ,  mr .  gannon ,  played by john mcintire in one of the best "bad guy" performances i've ever seen .  he comes on with so much charm and humor ,  and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart ,  that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he *is* the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in ,  it does so with double force .  further ,  by establishing a type of breezy (if necessarily guarded) camaraderie between mcintire and stewart ,  the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are - and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the film . <br /><br />i won't NOT_go NOT_through NOT_all NOT_the NOT_twists NOT_and NOT_turns NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_takes NOT_- NOT_see NOT_those NOT_for NOT_yourself NOT_(as NOT_well NOT_as NOT_the NOT_rugged NOT_and NOT_gorgeous NOT_alaskan NOT_scenery NOT_- NOT_filmed NOT_on NOT_location ,  mind you ,  not NOT_cheap NOT_painted NOT_stills NOT_that NOT_the NOT_studio NOT_made NOT_up) .  what's key here is how much this story focuses upon character ,  with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time - although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static (read: "talky") .  definitely one of the greatest performances i've seen from stewart ,  showing he could play the renegade ,  the "man's man" just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door .  if anything ,  in fact ,  his "everyman" qualities lend greater strength to his characterization ,  making him seem less mythic or overblown - -like ,  say ,  eastwood or john wayne - and more a three-dimensional personage .  his relationship with brennan is well-played: understated ,  but nevertheless touching (with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from "of mice and men" - an altogether different type of "western") . <br /><br />i certainly have more westerns to see ,  but this is for now my favorite ,  and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others .  it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is . 
1106 0 after eagerly waiting to the end ,  i have to say i wish i wouldn't NOT_have NOT_joined NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_series NOT_at NOT_the NOT_first NOT_place .  the final episode was everything against the previous seven years .  it has ruined everything .  the journey was 23 years ,  but captain janeway has the power to reduce it .  .  .  let say ,  seven years only .  why seven? why not NOT_just NOT_one? NOT_or NOT_nothing? NOT_why NOT_not NOT_avoid NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_adventure?

1107 1 after losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman ,  a trail boss winds up in the yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states .  while there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling .  good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup . 
1108 0 this film is awful .  the screenplay is bad ,  the is script mediocre ,  and even the sex scenes are worthless .  the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking .  this movie was shot in a dark ,  shadowy and monochromatic style (a la "war of the worlds") ,  which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film .  greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film .  the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic .  the only highlight is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell ,  faithfully continued in this sequel ,  but it isn't NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_the NOT_other NOT_shortcomings .  the only circumstance under which a "basic instinct 3" should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast . 
1109 1 (contains slight spoilers)<br /><br />it's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here .  stewart is ,  of course ,  remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra's "it's a wonderful life" ,  so it's easy to find parallels between the two films .  in "it's a wonderful life" ,  bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never NOT_been NOT_born .  in "the far country" ,  stewart's jeff webster ,  by not NOT_getting NOT_involved NOT_to NOT_help NOT_anyone NOT_else NOT_(except NOT_himself) ,  gets to see essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) doesn't NOT_exist . <br /><br />by not NOT_getting NOT_involved NOT_(and NOT_by NOT_attempting NOT_not NOT_to NOT_care NOT_about NOT_anyone) ,  webster is forced to see those for whom he can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_care NOT_get NOT_hurt ,  pushed around ,  and even killed while he stands by and does nothing .  this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not NOT_to NOT_get NOT_involved NOT_by NOT_not NOT_ever NOT_having NOT_been NOT_born .  <br /><br />both movies end with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell .  stewart ,  by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement ,  has ,  it would seem ,  earned his "wings" . 
1110 0 the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous .  the plot is awful .  .  . but on the plus side the acting is pretty good ,  with a few good shouts and rants .  sharon stone is ok this time .  .  . not NOT_even NOT_half NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_the NOT_original NOT_mind NOT_you .  the murders aren't NOT_as NOT_gory NOT_as NOT_the NOT_first NOT_one NOT_either ,  which is a shame .  its not NOT_the NOT_unpredictable NOT_mess NOT_everyone NOT_say NOT_it NOT_is NOT_though .  the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake (they are fully clothed) .  the script is weak most of the time ,  but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr . glass and washburn are highlights .  the plot twists a few times ,  but the ending is awful .  the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'oh my god!' .  the chase sequences are brilliantly directed ,  and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise ,  rush-felt film .  sharon stone is a bit old for this too .  the bits where we see her breasts were ,  in the first one ,  delights .  this time around ,  they are too horrid to describe .  the films its self is rather average ,  but it is worth a go .  mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz .  .  . with the opening sequence being a highlight .  not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_critical ,  but if you liked the first one - leave this one .  don't NOT_ruin NOT_the NOT_run .  you'll be glad you left this stone unturned . 
1111 1 my comment would have been added to the release date section ,  but i couldn't find a place for it .  i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u . s .  in feb .  ,  1955 .  i saw it in a "first run" theater in washington ,  d . c .  in march ,  1958 .  wonder if it was re-released ,  or some problem? in my opinion ,  this movie is very light entertainment ,  but has some classic characters .  john mcintyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief .  walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier .  and ,  in my opinion ,  james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did .  i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more ,  and never NOT_tire NOT_of NOT_seeing NOT_parts NOT_of NOT_it NOT_again .  the photography and scenery are splendid ,  and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes . 
1112 0 in my book "basic instinct" was a perfect film .  it had outstanding acting on the parts of stone ,  douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role .  it had marvelous photography ,  music and the noirest noir script ever .  all of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get!<br /><br />this sequel is the exact opposite ,  it cannot possibly get worse ,  bad acting and a lame script ,  combined with totally inept direction ,  this is really bad ,  boring ,  annoying .  the only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original .  these copies are so bad they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself ,  because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument .  the only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the jerry goldsmith score of bi1 .  michael caton-jones and the half-wit responsible for the script even included the "there is no NOT_smoking NOT_in NOT_this NOT_room" NOT_dialog NOT_in NOT_the NOT_interrogation NOT_scene NOT_and NOT_yes NOT_she NOT_sends NOT_her NOT_attorney NOT_(who NOT_is NOT_now NOT_a NOT_solicitor) NOT_away! NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i NOT_am NOT_sorry NOT_i NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_this NOT_awful NOT_film NOT_that NOT_should NOT_have NOT_never NOT_been NOT_made! NOT_it NOT_does NOT_damage NOT_to NOT_the NOT_original ,  so bad is it .  the only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and i am sure ms stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not NOT_restore NOT_the NOT_perfection NOT_of NOT_the NOT_original .  and what concerns the human body applies to film-making ,  too .  there should be a law: don't NOT_ever NOT_make NOT_a NOT_sequel NOT_to NOT_a NOT_perfect NOT_film! 
1113 1 cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim .  once there ,  they have to contend with seductive ,  shifty businesswoman ruth roman and ice-cold ,  happy-go-lucky villain james mcintire . <br /><br />john wayne may get talked about more ,  but his good pal stewart made some excellent ,  hard-edged westerns too ,  some with the great director anthony mann .  frankly ,  i'd take this ,  with it's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama ,  over north to alaska any day!<br /><br />the far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen . <br /><br />also ,  there's some strong support by the always reliable brennan ,  roman (who's great) ,  the incredibly cute corrine calvet ,  and james mcintire ,  who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy ,  the kind that doesn't NOT_take NOT_himself NOT_too NOT_seriously . <br /><br />this would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended mann/stewart northwest-set western ,  bend of the river . 
1114 0 it's hard to believe ,  after waiting 14 years ,  we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage .  the original was a high impact ,  dark thriller that achieved "cult" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven .  this film adds nothing ,  delivers nothing ,  and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels . <br /><br />the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast .  unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of catherine tramell .  .  .  or is it sharon stone .  possibly a copulation of both . <br /><br />if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in "b . s . 1" ,  forget it .  you wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them .  it's interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies ,  via the 1966 georgy girl ,  when ms .  stone was only 8 years old .  a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here . <br /><br />if you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system .  if not ,  you might as well wait for the dvd release in the "rated" version ,  "unrated" version ,  "collectors" edition ,  or "ultimate" version ,  and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of "basic instinct 3" at which point ms .  stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care . 
1115 1 as i drove from skagway ,  alaska to dawson city , yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery ,  i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location .  jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place ,  but still not NOT_the NOT_real NOT_place NOT_where NOT_the NOT_film NOT_takes NOT_place .  when the story moves to dawson ,  that is when i feel anthony mann ,  who used the outdoor locations so well ,  could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place .  james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself ,  one side of him does not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_get NOT_involved NOT_and NOT_help NOT_people NOT_who NOT_stand NOT_in NOT_the NOT_way NOT_of NOT_him NOT_making NOT_money ,  and the other side just is not NOT_able NOT_to NOT_look NOT_away NOT_from NOT_people NOT_being NOT_murdered .  ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not NOT_care NOT_on NOT_whom NOT_she NOT_steps ,  corinne calvet is the nice girl .  mann is excellent directing the shootouts ,  but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes .  he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery ,  the predominating white ,  like it was with the greens in "the naked spur" and the browns in "the man from laramie" .  like all of the mann-stewarts ,  this is a traditional western ,  with a difference in the elaboration of stewart's character which is more complex . 
1116 0 it's been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg-crossing that twisted many people's minds .  and now ,  god knows why ,  she's in the game again .  "basic instinct 2" is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica "basic instinct" featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas .  however ,  fans of the original might not NOT_even NOT_get NOT_close NOT_to NOT_this NOT_one ,  since "instinct 2" is painful film-making ,  as the mediocre director michael caton-jones assassinates the legacy of the first film . <br /><br />the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning .  catherine tramell (sharon stone ,  trying to look forcefully sexy) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder .  a psychiatrist (a horrible david morrisey) is appointed to examine her ,  but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction . <br /><br />and there it is ,  without no NOT_further NOT_explanations ,  the basic force that moves this "instinct" .  nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy ,  c-class erotic film .  sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn-off .  part of it because of the amateurish writing ,  the careless direction ,  and terrifyingly low chemistry .  the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldn't NOT_be NOT_rated NOT_nc-17) NOT_than NOT_the NOT_first NOT_entrance NOT_in NOT_the NOT_series .  "instinct" is a compelling torture . <br /><br />to top it off ,  everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not NOT_found NOT_anywhere NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film .  the acting here is really bad .  sharon stone has some highlights ,  but here ,  she gets extremely obnoxious .  david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life ,  and seems to never NOT_make NOT_more NOT_than NOT_two NOT_expressions NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie- NOT_confused NOT_and NOT_aroused .  "instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series ,  that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well .  paul verhoeven ,  how i miss you .  .  .  . <br /><br />"basic instinct 2" never NOT_sounded NOT_like NOT_a NOT_good NOT_movie ,  and ,  indeed ,  it isn't .  some films should never NOT_get NOT_out NOT_of NOT_paper ,  and that is the feeling you get after watching this .  now ,  it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out ,  and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this .  .  .  .  .  . -----3/10

1118 0 i saw this film at the london premiere ,  and i have to say - i didn't NOT_expect NOT_much ,  but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining . <br /><br />the original "basic instinct" was no NOT_great NOT_film NOT_and NOT_is NOT_still NOT_something NOT_of NOT_a NOT_"smut NOT_classic" NOT_but NOT_it NOT_was NOT_entertaining .  i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it . <br /><br />however ,  this lame-brain ,  waaay-belated sequel has nothing .  is sharon stone still gorgeous? well ,  let's put it this way -- for a 47-year-old ,  she's pretty hot .  is she as beautiful as she was in the original? no .  she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face ,  and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing .  she doesn't NOT_look NOT_as NOT_soft NOT_or NOT_genuine NOT_or NOT_innocent NOT_as NOT_she NOT_did NOT_in NOT_the NOT_original NOT_-- NOT_which NOT_is NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_point NOT_of NOT_being NOT_an NOT_evil NOT_seductress ,  and whatnot . <br /><br />the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible -- and michael caton-jones (a typically safe director -- one who doesn't NOT_always NOT_do NOT_great NOT_work NOT_but NOT_manages NOT_to NOT_make NOT_worthwhile NOT_movies) NOT_has NOT_officially NOT_delivered NOT_his NOT_first NOT_true NOT_turkey; NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_so NOT_bad NOT_people NOT_were NOT_laughing NOT_at NOT_certain NOT_moments NOT_that NOT_were NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_be NOT_serious . <br /><br />i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions ,  and it's very clear from the start .  nothing makes much sense .  the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending -- oh my! talk about stupid and unbelievable .  (still predictable ,  though . ) i saw "gigli , " i saw "son of the mask" -- and although i'm not NOT_looking NOT_to NOT_"smear" NOT_this NOT_film ,  i can say with my own authority (which you don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_agree NOT_with NOT_at NOT_all ,  mind you) that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure . <br /><br />by the way ,  stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub . <br /><br />"basic instinct 2" -- basically ,  it stinks ,  too . 
1119 1 a good film with--for its time--an intense ,  sprawling ,  rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford's "the searchers" though not NOT_so NOT_brutal .  the story starts fast and doesn't NOT_let NOT_up ,  with several scenes of really good dialog between (stewart's) jeff webster ,  ronda castle and sheriff gannon .  this film is in some ways reminiscent of "bend of the river" (1952) ,  also a mann-stewart work ,  but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting .  there are a few caveats: a too-quickly wrapped up (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old corrine calvert is not NOT_very NOT_convincing NOT_as NOT_a NOT_naive NOT_french NOT_teenager ,  and of course the film takes place in the mythic west ,  a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't NOT_apply .  but these are trivial concerns .  james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark ,  disengaged man who thinks he cares for no NOT_one NOT_but NOT_himself ,  and the mountain scenery can't NOT_be NOT_beat .  a fine western costume drama . 
1120 0 it's not NOT_like NOT_i NOT_have NOT_overwhelmingly NOT_fond NOT_memories NOT_of NOT_verhoeven's NOT_original NOT_pants-down NOT_shocker NOT_- NOT_it NOT_always NOT_struck NOT_me NOT_as NOT_a NOT_glossy ,  well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie .  thrilling ,  sexy trash ,  but trash nonetheless .  it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist .  after a decade of anti-sex aids-induced hysteria ,  a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff .  basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy ,  so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked .  all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable .  that it resoundingly fails on so many levels ,  and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved ,  is really quite extraordinary to watch .  let's state the obvious for starters - sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell .  what was so photogenic thru verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire michael caton-jones ,  who's flat ,  drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot .  i like sharon stone a lot ,  but if the first film launched her career ,  bi2 could kill it .  she has no NOT_chemistry NOT_with NOT_stuffed-shirt NOT_david NOT_morrissey NOT_- NOT_their NOT_only NOT_sex NOT_scene NOT_is NOT_embarrassing NOT_too NOT_watch .  his dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering ,  orange-skin machismo of michael douglas .  supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clichã©-heavy posturing .  and what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? poorly-lit ,  fleetingly-glimpsed ,  as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives - the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed .  don't NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_film NOT_for NOT_carnal NOT_thrills NOT_- NOT_there NOT_are NOT_none NOT_and NOT_what NOT_there NOT_is NOT_is NOT_tragic .  the film is ,  as a whole ,  convoluted to the point of utter confusion ,  boring and laughable .  the last 40 minutes in particular ,  where you come to the realisation that the film is ,  in fact ,  not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_go NOT_anywhere NOT_of NOT_interest NOT_at NOT_all ,  are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure .  as a failed sequel ,  basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic ,  beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2 .  as a vanity project ,  it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception .  as a multi-million dollar piece of hollywood film-making ,  it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst . 
1121 1 another very good mann flick thanks to the father/son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart .  brennan (ben tatum) is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne (red river/ rio bravo) .  he's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend .  "you're wrong mr .  dunston" .  jeff webster(stewart) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan .  john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it .  another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people .  the loner can do neither and suffers for it . <br /><br />the caption above plays on tatum's assertion that he can't NOT_live NOT_without NOT_his NOT_coffee .  this nicotine addiction proves fatal .  probably the first and last time on the screen . <br /><br />i recommend this film and now own the dvd . 
1122 0 well ,  i saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think .  first of all the plot is idiotic ,  it has no NOT_sense NOT_at NOT_all .  the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues .  the audience was laughing many times .  and the suspense is very low .  actors play so-so ,  with an exception of sharon stone ,  who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments .  the saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "i want to *beep* you " and it looks like ,  let's say it gently ,  a very very mature woman acting rude and not NOT_sexy NOT_at NOT_all .  that erotic tension from bi1 is totally gone .  from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to dvd ,  but on a far lower lever than the original movie .  for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly .  the director of basic instinct 2 is no NOT_paul NOT_verhoeven NOT_and NOT_it NOT_shows .  the new composer is no NOT_jerry NOT_goldsmith NOT_and NOT_its NOT_shows .  the script is done by people who are no NOT_match NOT_for NOT_joe NOT_eszterhas .  there's no NOT_substitute NOT_for NOT_michael NOT_douglas NOT_in NOT_it .  the film looks cheap and badly edited at times .  i'm sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was: "why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this .  the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema .  it was provoking ,  sexy and controversial .  it had the best sharon stone's performance in her career .  it had this specific paul verhoeven's style .  unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie ,  badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many categories .  it's a pity that they made this film . 
1123 1 anthony mann's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre .  he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart - in mann's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience .  in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance .  here it is a "i trust only myself" attitude ,  which leads to one complication after another .  even before the film properly begins he (as jeff webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute (we never NOT_are NOT_clear NOT_about NOT_it NOT_- NOT_either NOT_they NOT_wanted NOT_to NOT_leave NOT_the NOT_cattle NOT_drive ,  or they tried to steal the cattle) .  <br /><br />he meets his match in skagway ,  the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson .  skagway's boss is a so-called law man named gannon (john mcintyre) who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the "gold rush" jefferson "soapy" smith and judge roy bean .  the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money .  stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for gannon's profit) .  <br /><br />stewart is partner with ben (walter brennan - who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean) .  they are also joined by rube morris (jay c .  flippen) and also meet two women ,  the sophisticated rhonda castle (ruth roman) and the friendly and helpful renee vallon (corinne calvert) .  rhonda works closely with gannon ,  but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle .  however ,  she has a similar "i only trust myself" attitude to jeff .  she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson .  he ,  ben ,  and rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle .  renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following .  jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border ,  although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang him . <br /><br />the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson ,  jeff opting for a longer and safer route .  after he is proved right ,  they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields .  the herd is sold to rhonda ,  and jeff ,  ben ,  rube ,  and renee start prospecting .  there is soon two groups in the town of dawson .  one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town .  but the mounties won't NOT_be NOT_setting NOT_up NOT_a NOT_station NOT_in NOT_dawson NOT_for NOT_months .  the other ,  centering around the "dancehall" run by rhonda ,  are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (robert j .  wilke - really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c .  flippen ,  jack elam ,  and harry morgan) .  jeff wishes to steer clear of both ,  and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah .  but will they get there? and will jeff remain neutral?<br /><br />the performances are dandy here ,  including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers ,  but would otherwise be peaceful enough .  brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers ,  whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results .  flippen is a drunk at first ,  but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart's own words against him .  mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond ,  but his work in mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester '73) .  he is ,  as is said elsewhere on this thread ,  really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor .  roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being ,  whose fate is determined by her better feelings .  and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier "gigi" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman . <br /><br />best of all is the canadian rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford .  mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film ,  and the viewer will appreciate the results . 
1124 0 i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one .  **mild spoilers** starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? the poor of london coming out to sing? fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset? not NOT_exactly NOT_faithful NOT_to NOT_the NOT_novel .  as i recall ,  dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison .  **end of spoilers**<br /><br />oliver reed is very weak as sykes ,  doing little more than growling to indicate his evil .  worst however ,  is mark lester as oliver ,  who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character .  his portrayal is in no NOT_way NOT_helped NOT_by NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_the NOT_best NOT_they NOT_could NOT_do NOT_when NOT_he NOT_sings NOT_is NOT_dub NOT_in NOT_the NOT_voice NOT_of NOT_a NOT_girl .  guess they didn't NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_boy NOT_trebles NOT_can NOT_be NOT_found NOT_in NOT_almost NOT_every NOT_church NOT_in NOT_england . <br /><br />self-respecting dickens fans: stick to david lean's amazing 1948 film or the bbc 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80's .  avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical . 
1125 1 this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster(jimmy stewart) and ronda castle(ruth roman) .  she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway ,  and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder .  they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction .  neither trusts a member of the opposite sex ,  apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them .  gradually ,  they learn to trust each other ,  as they journey from skagway to dawson .  but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway .  she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff .  meanwhile ,  rene ,  a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff ,  but only gets insulting brush offs in return .  yet ,  she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson .  along with ronda ,  she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim .  walter brennan ,  as ben ,  serves as jeff's long time sidekick .  he doesn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_meaty NOT_role ,  but serves to soften jeff's hard edges .  his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff . <br /><br />john mcintire(as sheriff gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film ,  oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying .  evidently ,  he sees something of himself in jeff ,  repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him .  he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith ,  who spent his last years in skagway ,  as one of the premier con men of his times . <br /><br />jeff is the quintessential antihero ,  a loner(except for companion ben) ,  who doesn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_stick NOT_his NOT_neck NOT_out NOT_for NOT_others ,  even when he knows he is the one right man for the job .  in this respect ,  he closely resemble's burt lancaster's character in "vera cruz" ,  for example .  thus ,  jeff not NOT_only NOT_turns NOT_down NOT_the NOT_job NOT_of NOT_marshall NOT_of NOT_dawson ,  he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims ,  while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson .  even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive .  then ,  jeff has a sudden change of heart ,  apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself .  he changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon's gang from dawson .  in this respect ,  he differs from lancaster's character ,  who never NOT_reforms(but NOT_is NOT_jeff NOT_truly NOT_changed ,  or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)<br /><br />the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women .  clearly ,  ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff .  although she is clearly characterized as a "bad" girl ,  jeff has a checkered recent past himself ,  having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon ,  and having stolen his cattle back from gannon .  ironically ,  soon after jeff changes from anti-hero to hero ,  rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon's impending ambush .  she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didn't NOT_just NOT_look NOT_out NOT_for NOT_herself(his NOT_supposedly NOT_just NOT_abandoned NOT_creed!) . <br /><br />it's clear that corine calvert ,  as renee ,  just doesn't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_credible NOT_substitute NOT_for NOT_the NOT_dead NOT_ronda ,  in jeff's mind .  yet ,  the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together ,  even though jeff never NOT_visibly NOT_gives NOT_her NOT_a NOT_kiss NOT_or NOT_hug .  her image as a good ,  if naive ,  young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust ,  pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later .  i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris ,  a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her . (he's not NOT_her NOT_father) . <br /><br />another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon's gang .  if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol ,  he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk ,  before jeff did the same to him .  and how did jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims .  they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow .  and why weren't NOT_most NOT_of NOT_ronda's NOT_pack NOT_horses NOT_and NOT_mules NOT_also NOT_buried NOT_by NOT_the NOT_avalanche?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>you NOT_will NOT_see NOT_a NOT_host NOT_of NOT_probably NOT_nameless NOT_but NOT_familiar NOT_faces NOT_among NOT_the NOT_miners NOT_and NOT_gannon's NOT_gang .  the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action .  all-in-all ,  a very entertaining western ,  with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end .  no NOT_doubt ,  this film takes some great liberties with history and geography ,  especially ,  the part taking place in the canadian yukon ,  which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway . 
1126 0 must every good story be "improved" with added corny broadway music? apparently those who can't NOT_come NOT_up NOT_with NOT_their NOT_own NOT_plots NOT_think NOT_that NOT_classic NOT_literature NOT_is NOT_just NOT_there NOT_for NOT_the NOT_plundering .  i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not NOT_my NOT_favorites ,  as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out ,  and this was a great example of just that .  .  .  so of course ,  take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? argh .  fetch me a basin . <br /><br />the four stars in my rating come from casting ,  which i could liken to that of my fair lady .  each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of ,  but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above) .  unlike my fair lady ,  those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed (pardon if i'm mistaken ,  it's been a while) . <br /><br />my biggest complaint i've stated .  why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? seldom has this been done to good effect .  generally it ruins the story .  it did with this one .  jury's still out on whether this story is worth saving ,  but with all that gadding about ,  it's impossible to tell . 
1127 1 the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart (excluding the few days mann worked on night passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances) ,  the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption ,  fighting it every step of the way .  this time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintire's larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order .  stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border ,  he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims .  .  . <br /><br />while it's no NOT_great NOT_surprise NOT_which NOT_way NOT_stewart NOT_turns NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end ,  he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way ,  even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not NOT_warning NOT_a NOT_group NOT_of NOT_prospectors NOT_of NOT_an NOT_impending NOT_avalanche NOT_when NOT_he NOT_has NOT_the NOT_chance NOT_because NOT_it's NOT_not NOT_his NOT_problem .  for most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and mcintire ,  something the judge recognises immediately ,  revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him .  in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature ,  there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is . <br /><br />as usual with mann there's an exceptional use of high country locations ,  though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground ,  and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan ,  harry morgan and ruth roman (though corinne calvert's young romantic interest veers to the irritating) .  sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer ,  with only the theatrical trailer as an extra . 
1128 0 the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester ,  who couldn't act or sing ,  in the title role .  aside from his very bad "acting" ,  all of lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl .  i don't NOT_know NOT_why NOT_they NOT_cast NOT_him NOT_at NOT_all ,  since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well .  shani wallis was far too old to play nancy ,  who was only supposed to be 16 .  the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way .  ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was .  it was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968 . 
1129 1 colorful western . <br /><br />wyoming cowboy james stewart moseys on up to the yukon territory to dig for gold ,  sell his steers ,  and try to get a date with pretty saloon-owner ruth roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff john mcintire who wants stewart's cattle .  beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by william fritzsche and bill daniels .  good technicolor adventure from universal-international ,  directed by anthony mann . <br /><br />also starring corinne calvet ,  connie gilchrist ,  and walter brennan as stewart's sidekick . 
1130 0 the same difficulty i have with the musical version of "les miserables" applies equally to "oliver . " instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings ,  they merely wrote broadway-type melodies ,  which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed . <br /><br />too ,  the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not NOT_mix NOT_well NOT_with NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sunny NOT_ditties NOT_which NOT_permeate NOT_the NOT_score .  it's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste . <br /><br />the casting of the boy oliver doesn't NOT_help NOT_matters: NOT_tentative NOT_of NOT_timbre NOT_and NOT_vexingly NOT_precious ,  there's something less than solid here .  fagin performs his traditional routine adequately ,  though the tunes he's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner . <br /><br />"as long as he needs me" is given a strident rendition ,  throaty and strained .  the two big production numbers ,  "who will buy" and "consider yourself" seem over-produced ,  with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in .  it's one thing to go all out ,  yet another to cross over the line into excess .  <br /><br />the gloom ,  despair and depravity of much of the novel does not NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_lend NOT_itself NOT_to NOT_such NOT_ditties NOT_and NOT_choreography .  while the novel is considered a classic ,  i must confess i have trouble with mr .  dickens' consciousness ,  in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration .  this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life ,  which was full of disappointment and regret .  <br /><br />not all the combined talent of this production ,  either on- or behind camera ,  can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material .  all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me . <br /><br /> 
1131 1 this first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement ,  romance ,  and james stewart to the screen .  "the far country" is the only one out of all five stewart-mann westerns that is often overlooked .  stewart ,  yet again ,  puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five stewart-mann westerns .  jeff webster (stewart) is uncaring ,  always looking out for himself ,  which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him .  ironically ,  he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not NOT_ride NOT_without .  this displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick ,  ben tatum ,  played by walter brennan ,  since tatum is the one that gave it to him .  mann ,  yet again ,  puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart-mann westerns .  he displays violence ,  excitement ,  plot twists ,  romance ,  and corruption .  the story is that jeff and ben ,  through a series of events ,  wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson ,  along with gold partners calvet and flippen ,  and no-good but beautiful roman and her hired men .  they are unable to leave ,  because crooked sheriff mr .  gannon (mcintire) and his "deputies" will hang them ,  since the only way out is through skagway ,  which is gannon's town .  but ,  eventually ,  mcintire comes to them ,  but not NOT_to NOT_collect NOT_stewart NOT_and/or NOT_his NOT_fine NOT_that NOT_he NOT_supposedly NOT_owes NOT_to NOT_the NOT_government .  what is mcintire there for? he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money .  people are killed .  a sheriff for dawson is considered needed ,  and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun .  stewart ,  however ,  refuses the job ,  because he plans to get all the gold he can ,  and then pull out .  he also refuses it because he does not NOT_like NOT_to NOT_help NOT_people ,  since law and order always gets somebody killed .  so ,  flippen is elected instead .  a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon's men ,  a purely evil ,  mustachioed fancy gunman named madden ,  who carries two guns ,  played by wilke .  flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done ,  but he cannot stand up to him ,  so he becomes the town drunk .  a man named yukon replaces flippen .  stewart and tatum start to pull out ,  but are ambushed by gannon's men .  tatum is killed ,  and stewart is wounded .  stewart finally realizes that he must do something ,  or gannon will take over dawson ,  set up his own rules ,  and it will become his town ,  just like skagway .  the audience also realizes what stewart must do .  another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon .  if stewart leaves ,  gannon would take over the town .  if stewart stays and keeps on not NOT_doing NOT_anything NOT_about NOT_it ,  the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly .  this is where a great scene occurs .  stewart walks into his cabin .  he has a sling on his arm .  for a few seconds ,  his gun ,  in the gunbelt ,  is hanging on a post beside his bed ,  the gun is close up ,  stewart is in the background ,  just inside the door .  he stares at it for a few seconds .  he tosses the sling away .  the sling lands on the back of a chair ,  and falls to the floor .  this is symbolic ,  because he is throwing away his old life ,  which consisted of not NOT_caring NOT_about NOT_anybody NOT_but NOT_himself .  he comes into his new life ,  of helping people when they need help .  what ends the film is a guns-blazing ,  furious show of good against evil ,  and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright .

1133 1 cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre .  much like other anthony mann pictures ,  the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery .  both of which play out amongst some of mann's peccadilloes like honour ,  integrity ,  betrayal and of course ,  death! the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster {james stewart} and ben tatum {walter brennan} travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle .  aware of the blossoming gold-boom ,  they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town .  arriving in skagway they find self-appointed judge mr .  gannon {john mcintire} ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law ,  all be it with honest cause ,  along the way .  in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them ,  but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson-with gannon and his men in hot pursuit .  here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved . <br /><br />interesting from start to finish ,  the far country benefits greatly from james stewart's bubbling {anti} hero in waiting portrayal and mann's slick direction of the tight borden chase script .  the cinematography from william h .  daniels is superlative ,  tho not NOT_done NOT_any NOT_favours NOT_by NOT_current NOT_dvd NOT_prints ,  and the film has a few surprises and a "will he wont he?" core reeling the viewers in .  paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans ,  it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful ,  yet dark ,  western world of anthony mann and james stewart .  8/10 
1134 0 this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made . how can jon bon jovi play in a movie? he is a singer not NOT_an NOT_actor ,  what?is he killing vampires with his guitar? and what about the dreadful plot? o my god this movie really sucks .  in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover (blade) surrounded by an army of vampires ,  but when the "fantastic" slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left!! what happened with the other 10-15 vampires? they run out in the sun??? and what about the "grand finally" when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun??? that's really a "not"  .  in "buffy the vampire slayer" in 100 episodes not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_vampire NOT_is NOT_killed NOT_with NOT_a NOT_shotgun??? NOT_this NOT_really NOT_is NOT_a NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_originality! 
1135 1 jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best . <br /><br />the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story .  some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film . <br /><br />in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast .  no NOT_exception NOT_here ,  right down to parts that might only have a few lines ,  the characters are firmly etched with those lines . <br /><br />stewart is a cynical hard-bitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan .  it's brennan's death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process . <br /><br />john mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range .  he could play delightful old codgers ,  authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain .  <br /><br />one of the best westerns ever .

1138 0 thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey ,  john carpenter and tommy lee wallace .  this movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic .  the first vampires was fun ,  but this low budget retread makes me yawn . <br /><br />jon bon jovi (the poor man's kevin bacon) drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderas's guitar case in desperado .  he picks up some lame "hunters" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire) ,  and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no NOT_backstory NOT_and NOT_so NOT_we NOT_could NOT_care NOT_less NOT_about NOT_her NOT_or NOT_her NOT_quest NOT_(to NOT_walk NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sunlight NOT_by NOT_stealing NOT_the NOT_black NOT_cross NOT_and NOT_performing NOT_a NOT_ritual NOT_to NOT_allow NOT_her NOT_to NOT_do NOT_so) .  if you've seen the first vampires ,  you've already seen this ,  and done much better . <br /><br />john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately .  frankly ,  i think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic .  the only decent film he's done since they live (1987) is vampires .  everything else is complete crap ,  right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars .  .  .  and now this waste of celluloid .  where are more greats like assault on precinct 13 ,  halloween (1) ,  escape from new york and the thing?<br /><br />carpenter crony wallace proves he can't NOT_write NOT_his NOT_way NOT_out NOT_of NOT_a NOT_paper NOT_bag NOT_with NOT_his NOT_paper-thin NOT_script NOT_packed NOT_with NOT_yawns ,  groans and recycled gags from the original .  did i mention i hated every character in the movie? there was not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_memorable NOT_character NOT_in NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_film .  how does that happen? this film has nothing to recommend it .  not NOT_even NOT_the NOT_dvd NOT_presentation NOT_is NOT_good; NOT_the NOT_menu NOT_looks NOT_awful . <br /><br />by comparison ,  jason x: "friday the 13th in space" was a masterpiece .  now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise ,  ladies and germs ,  as well as create an exciting dvd menu . 
1139 1 a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers ,  norman and paul ,  (brad pitt and craig sheffer) whose reverend father (tom skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing ,  - and ,  for him and his sons ,  there is a fine line between the two .  this story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths .  it is a touching movie narrated by the director ,  robert redford ,  playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead . <br /><br />certain themes recur in the movie ,  such as memory ,  death ,  eternity ,  and dreams .  most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul .  he is a capable ,  charming ,  and brave man ,  but has his fatal flaws . <br /><br />the closing lines sum up the "point" of the movie: "then in the arctic half-light of the canyon ,  all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise .  eventually ,  all things merge into one ,  and a river runs through it .  the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time .  on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops .  under the rocks are the words ,  and some of the words are theirs .  i am haunted by waters . " 
1140 0 john carpenter's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication .  his excuse is that he only produced it .  jon bon jovi looks like a girl .  in fact ,  bon jovi and the two vampire girls ,  natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes .  in short ,  it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way .  bon jovi has the most charisma .  at least he looks happy when he is smiling .  the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints .  at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss ,  but stop .  amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires .  at one point ,  arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act .  it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof ,  and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not NOT_happening .  as far as gore is concerned ,  a few heads are ripped off ,  and the blood spurts profusely .  these scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny ,  and there is no NOT_"horror" NOT_pay-off NOT_from NOT_the NOT_scene .  all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of "wow ,  that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls .  i wonder who has to clean it up . " throughout the movie ,  these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover (the top vampire in the world??) keep reaching out to her .  at one point ,  bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow (and has done so on other occasions) ,  he says "i am not NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_hurt NOT_you .  i just want to talk to you .  i want to get to know you . " huh?? of course ,  the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device .  "why can't NOT_we NOT_be NOT_friends" NOT_the NOT_1970s NOT_hit NOT_song NOT_by NOT_war NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_the NOT_theme NOT_song NOT_for NOT_this NOT_movie .  aside from all of the other silly moments ,  there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed ,  and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion .  i guess blood type is not NOT_important? NOT_anyhow ,  all her vampire blood is removed .  bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him ,  he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also .  of course ,  as the vampire blood is transfused into him ,  none of his healthy blood is removed .  so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body .  and just like the first vampires ,  this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect . 
1141 1 embarrassingly ,  i just watched this movie for the first time ,  13 years after its release .  it's a story that any father or brother can relate to .  .  .  one brother is a bit 'wild , ' the other brother is the typical older child .  craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother ,  but pitt is amazing ,  and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father .  the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking .  .  .  i had no NOT_idea NOT_that NOT_fly NOT_fishing NOT_could NOT_be NOT_so NOT_attractive .  the movie closely follows the book ,  with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format .  unlike most book to movie stories ,  this one measures up .  it's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie . 
1142 0 i only rented this because i loved the first movie .  however ,  calling it john carpenters vampires: los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it .  he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (jeepers creepers anyone?)<br /><br />a tragic storyline ,  terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time .  it's not NOT_even NOT_comically NOT_bad . <br /><br />what we end up with is a dull ,  uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichã©d acting .  it just reeks of low budget . <br /><br />avoid like the bubonic plague . 
1143 1 in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie .  i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible .  after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice .  i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so .  it is amazing .  i can not NOT_think NOT_of NOT_anyone NOT_else NOT_that NOT_could NOT_play NOT_the NOT_role NOT_better NOT_than NOT_brad NOT_pitt .  do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era .  strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming ,  do not NOT_try NOT_to NOT_learn NOT_how NOT_to NOT_fly NOT_fish NOT_from NOT_the NOT_scenes NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_although NOT_it NOT_looks NOT_great NOT_on NOT_the NOT_film NOT_you NOT_have NOT_no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_much NOT_practice NOT_and NOT_skill NOT_fishing NOT_like NOT_that NOT_actually NOT_takes .  thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie . 
1144 0 ugh ,  what can i say other than ,  ugh .  i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires .  this movie could not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_any NOT_lamer .  lacking not NOT_only NOT_in NOT_plot ,  but the acting is atrocious .  combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch .  many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark .  here's a sampling of the lamer aspects .  .  . <br /><br />***spoilers***<br /><br />professional "slayer" insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night .  he wakes up to a woman crying ,  sitting no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_3 NOT_feet NOT_from NOT_him NOT_in NOT_the NOT_middle NOT_of NOT_nowhere .  he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance .  she goes from crying to seducing him ,  and he lets it happen with obvious results .  .  . <br /><br />one of the main characters is zoe ,  was bitten by a vampire ,  but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in mexico city ,  she's fine ,  although her body temperature is below room temperature .  .  . <br /><br />guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires ,  hero leaves the next day .  he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left .  .  . <br /><br /> .  .  . avoid this movie . 
1145 1 in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no NOT_purpose NOT_to NOT_the NOT_role NOT_of NOT_jess's NOT_brother NOT_here NOT_is NOT_my NOT_response:<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>the NOT_role NOT_of NOT_jess's NOT_brother NOT_is NOT_to NOT_provide NOT_a NOT_form NOT_of NOT_dramatic NOT_irony NOT_in NOT_the NOT_story .  craig sheffer/norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jess's brother turned out .  there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel ,  for example ,  when jess's brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later .  the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death ,  knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film . 
1146 0 the last reviewer was very generous .  i quiet like the first movie ,  but can't NOT_say NOT_i NOT_enjoy NOT_this NOT_one NOT_very NOT_much .  the beginning is bearable ,  but it goes downhill pretty quickly .  i just don't NOT_see NOT_jon NOT_bon NOT_jovi NOT_as NOT_a NOT_"bad-ass NOT_vampire NOT_hunter" NOT_and NOT_the NOT_vampire NOT_princess NOT_is NOT_neither NOT_sexy NOT_nor NOT_scary .  a lot of the scenes just do not NOT_make NOT_sense .  i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you ,  let alone an experienced hunter .  why una is able to communicate with jovi? nothing was ever explain in this movie ,  you wouldn't NOT_mind NOT_if NOT_it NOT_was NOT_entertaining ,  but that was too much to ask .  this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen . 
1147 1 i've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is .  life sometimes has boring patches ,  no NOT_real NOT_plot ,  and not NOT_necessarily NOT_a NOT_happy NOT_ending .  "a river runs through it" is the perfect name for this film (and norman maclean's novel) .  life ebbs and flows like a river ,  and it has it's rough spots ,  but it is a wonderful trip . <br /><br />robert redford brings a lot to the film .  his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly .  as a director ,  he is restrained and calm ,  and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes .  as for the acting ,  craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers .  i don't NOT_know NOT_quite NOT_how NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_tom NOT_skerritt NOT_and NOT_brenda NOT_blethyn's NOT_performances ,  except that they truly feel real .  "a river runs through it" is a wonderful film . <br /><br />8 . 6 out of 10

1149 1 academy award winner robert redford (best director .  ordinary people 1980) captures the majesty of the montana wilderness and the strength of the american family in this acclaimed adaptation of norman macleans classic memoir . <br /><br />craig sheffer stars as the young norman ,  and brad pitt stars as his brother paul ,  an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world . <br /><br />growing up ,  both boys rebel against their stern minister father (tom skerritt) . <br /><br />while norman channels his rebellion into writing ,  paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction . <br /><br />also starring emily lloyd as wild-hearted jessie burns . <br /><br />the film won an academy award for best cinematopghaphy in 1993 .

1151 1 great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt's character interviewing the president , or pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us . scenes like those would have kept the audience awake . cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those . the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watching . also , big fans of fising , early 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
1152 0 hi folks<br /><br />forget about that movie .  john c .  should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits .  bon jovi has never NOT_been NOT_and NOT_will NOT_never NOT_be NOT_an NOT_actor NOT_and NOT_the NOT_fx NOT_are NOT_a NOT_joke . <br /><br />the first vampires was good  .  .  .  and it was the only vampires .  this thing here just wears the same name . <br /><br />just a waste of time thinks  .  .  . <br /><br />jake scorpio 
1153 1 this film was just brilliant , casting , location scenery , story , direction , everyone's really suited the part they played , and you could just imagine being there , robert redford's is an amazing actor and now the same being director , norman's father came from the same scottish island as myself , so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film , the witty remarks throughout the film were great , it was just brilliant , so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch , and the fly-fishing was amazing , really cried at the end it was so sad , and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good , and this definitely was ,  also congratulations to the two little boy's that played the part's of norman and paul they were just brilliant , children are often left out of the praising list i think ,  because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film , but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done ,  don't NOT_you NOT_think?

1155 1 this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen .  the footage is extraordinary ,  mesmerizing at times .  it also received an oscar for best photography ,  and deservedly so .  i have many movies in my film collection and several more i've seen besides them ,  and not NOT_many NOT_of NOT_them NOT_are NOT_more NOT_beautifully NOT_or NOT_even NOT_equally NOT_as NOT_beautifully NOT_shot NOT_as NOT_this NOT_one . <br /><br />it's unique and an overall great movie .  the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters .  we follow their destinies with devotion ,  and get very emotionally attached to them .  along the way ,  we also learn things about ourselves and our lives .  i think much of this film for what it represent ,  and how it present it .  i warmly recommend it

1157 1 there is not NOT_much NOT_more NOT_i NOT_can NOT_say NOT_about NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_than NOT_all NOT_of NOT_the NOT_commentaries NOT_on NOT_page NOT_one ,  except - as jesse says - "it's the berries" .  all of page one's commentators wrote eloquently - as almost so as the dialog is in this movie .  this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about ,  but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines: a beautiful script .  maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie ,  so that the beauty of the story would not NOT_get NOT_lost . <br /><br />i ,  too ,  attended church when i was very young and into my late teens .  the church's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev .  maclean did in his church .  that ,  in itself ,  is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches - no NOT_holy-rollering NOT_in NOT_my NOT_church .  it was a big church ,  with many different programs to keep its congregation busy - the most inspiring perhaps was the music-department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems .  too ,  the sunday evening-congregation was almost entirely younger people .  are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night? how i wish it still was ! watching "a river runs through it" is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life .  as has already been so beautifully written ,  the sermon for this movie is the open-space beauties of montana - yet ,  aren't NOT_there NOT_also NOT_missile-silos NOT_there ,  too? fly-fishing or any other activity which draws family-members closer together for a happy life - and deep understanding of one another - becomes a blessing .  although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then ,  too ,  the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart ,  if you let it .  speakeasies and prostitutes are counter-balanced by the simple gatherings of old-fashioned ,  community picnics as this movie contains - in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it "a day together" .  there is noting wrong with that ,  but as "river" demonstrates ,  some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer .  this is the third film i've seen in which tom skeritt (?) plays a father ,  all different styles and brilliantly acted . <br /><br />brad pitt ,  mostly an undiscovered talent except for "thelma and louise" and "meet joe black" ,  and all of the cast-members deserved many awards .  little stories superbly told will get 10-of-10 from me over any movie with violence ,  foul language ,  ugliness and "action" .  i am thinking particularly of "crash" and most of "arnold's" movies .  what a savior for peace this movie is . 
1158 0 listening to the director's commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie .  the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that "i could write a book/screenplay/award winning sitcom" phase .  there's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because its a sequel to some-one else's movie) ,  but it is totally buried under an underwritten ,  badly executed and laughably un-thought-out script . <br /><br />the lines are dire ,  and the performances are un-engaging ,  though again ,  i'm inclined to blame the director .  he does not NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_have NOT_consulted NOT_the NOT_actors NOT_at NOT_all NOT_about NOT_what NOT_is NOT_required ,  rather plonked the script in their hands ,  pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it .  who knows ,  with a little coaching ,  these actors could have acquitted themselves better (say what you like about musicians in movies ,  jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading man) . <br /><br />as it stands ,  the cast have no NOT_chemistry NOT_whatsoever .  a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when ,  in order to infect bon jovi's character with vampire blood from his ailing co-hunter ,  he is given a transfusion .  she should have bitten him .  mind you ,  they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too .  the only real moment of sexual tension ,  between the two female leads ,  is by the directors own admittance accidental .  he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition - so ,  i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse .  but not NOT_a NOT_lot . <br /><br />frankly ,  as movies go ,  this is badly plotted ,  silly and forgettable .  even as trashy movies go it's not NOT_sexy NOT_enough NOT_or NOT_gory NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_be NOT_entertaining .  it could have been a fun and bloody little romp ,  but the director has left with more of a comedy ,  for all the wrong reasons . 
1159 1 in my humble opinion ,  this movie did not NOT_receive NOT_the NOT_recognition NOT_it NOT_deserved .  robert redford lives near me here in provo ,  utah ,  at sundance .  i enjoy most of his work ,  and this was my favorite .  i'm sorry that more people didn't NOT_appreciate NOT_it .  my grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen .  she gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together .  the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart ,  and i was weepy for several days after seeing the movie .  sometimes love isn't NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_our NOT_loved NOT_ones NOT_from NOT_hurting NOT_themselves .  we see this in our own family relationships ,  yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time .  the cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- i was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book ,  norman maclean ,  "but when i am alone in the half light of the canyon ,  all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul ,  and memories .  and the sounds of the big black foot river ,  and a four count rhythm ,  and the hope that a fish will rise .  eventually ,  all things merge into one ,  and a river runs through it .  the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time .  on some of the rocks are timeless raindrops .  under the rocks are the words ,  and some of the words are theirs .  i am haunted by waters . " these words ,  taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie (by robert redford who is narrating as norman maclean) ,  are basically scripture ,  in my opinion .  any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography .  it was beautiful! 
1160 0 really bad movie ,  the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement . <br /><br />this vampire's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far ,  derek bliss (jon bon jovi) ,  travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers! ,  he use some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to blade) ,  and is part of some van helsig vampire's hunters net? ,  ok ,  but he work alone .  he's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight (is almost a sequel of vampires (1998) directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods) ,  derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: sancho (diego luna ,  really bad acting also) a teenager without experience ,  father rodrigo (cristian de la fuente) a catholic priest ,  zoey (natasha wagner) a particular vampire and ray collins (darius mccrary) another expert vampire hunter .  so obviously in this adventure he isn't NOT_alone . <br /><br />you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor (jon bon jovi); is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods ,  and then ,  if you watch the film (i don't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_part) ,  you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories ,  totally predictable ,  with terrible acting performances ,  really bad special effects and incoherent events! . <br /><br />i deeply recommend not NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_film! ,  rent another movie ,  see another channel ,  go out with your friends ,  etc . <br /><br />3/10 
1161 1 when i first saw this movie i was with my dad .  he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites .  after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites .  <br /><br />a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life .  norman maclean (craig sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education .  paul maclean (brad pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles .  the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path . <br /><br />there is no NOT_downside NOT_to NOT_this NOT_movie .  you will be entertained the whole way through .  the acting ,  directing ,  and script is all perfect .  the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score .  both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you .  <br /><br />this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic .  it sure is in my book .  if you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever . 
1162 0 before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan .  in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place .  i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much . <br /><br />but this isn't NOT_half NOT_as NOT_good .  not NOT_even NOT_jon NOT_could NOT_save NOT_this NOT_film NOT_for NOT_me .  my main problem would be that it simply isn't NOT_scary .  apart from jon's character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not ,  especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman .  the female vampire simply isn't NOT_scary NOT_or NOT_sexy .  rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl ,  no NOT_wonder NOT_she NOT_is NOT_so NOT_desperate NOT_for NOT_blood NOT_then .  another huge problem is that everything is just "too bright" .  there is no NOT_atmosphere NOT_or NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_dread .  i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasn't NOT_exactly NOT_the NOT_twilight NOT_zone NOT_in NOT_terms NOT_of NOT_creepiness NOT_but NOT_yet NOT_it NOT_still NOT_managed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_dark NOT_and NOT_foreboding NOT_when NOT_it NOT_needed NOT_to NOT_be .  this film has no NOT_tension NOT_like NOT_that . <br /><br />the story is basically the same as before .  vampire wants berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight .  however the story has less cool bits this time .  there is no NOT_wow NOT_factor NOT_in NOT_knowing NOT_this NOT_is NOT_the NOT_master NOT_of NOT_all NOT_master NOT_- NOT_the NOT_original NOT_vampire ,  as in the first film .  you really don't NOT_care NOT_who NOT_or NOT_what NOT_this NOT_one NOT_is .  there is no NOT_army NOT_of NOT_masters .  instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy temple . <br /><br />so there you have it really .  lack of scares ,  lack of atmosphere ,  lack of interesting story .  a real let down for me personally . 
1163 1 a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated .  the acting is wonderful and understated ,  with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning .  brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father .  the movie moves like a river ,  you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows ,  but it is well worth it in the end . 
1164 0 brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature ,  particularly the nature of addiction ,  which still resonate strongly today . <br /><br />as for the movie .  .  .  eh .  nothing special .  the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything ,  making the viewer quite nauseous .  why the director didn't NOT_put NOT_a NOT_stop NOT_to NOT_this NOT_is NOT_beyond NOT_me--but NOT_maybe NOT_he NOT_was NOT_too NOT_busy NOT_trying ,  and somehow failing ,  to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors .  all in all ,  a weak adaptation .  your three hours would be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book . 
1165 1 as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie .  especially one that i'd want to comment on .  and it's not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_a NOT_point-counterpoint NOT_sorta NOT_deal; NOT_i NOT_just NOT_like NOT_to NOT_see NOT_what NOT_people NOT_say NOT_on NOT_the NOT_flipside . <br /><br />however ,  i do want to address one thing .  many people that hated it called it ,  to paraphrase ,  'beautiful ,  but shallow , ' some even going so far as to say that norm's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot ,  at best . <br /><br />i'd like to disagree . <br /><br />as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction ,  i can relate .  daily ,  you see them abuse themselves ,  knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction .  and it's not NOT_about NOT_the NOT_specifics NOT_of NOT_what NOT_they NOT_did NOT_when; NOT_how NOT_or NOT_why NOT_paul NOT_decided NOT_to NOT_take NOT_up NOT_gambling NOT_and NOT_associating NOT_with NOT_questionable NOT_folks; NOT_it's NOT_really NOT_more NOT_how NOT_they NOT_are NOT_wired .  on one hand ,  they are veritable geniuses ,  and on the other ,  painfully self-destructive (it's a lot like people like howard hughes â— the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart) and all the while you see this ,  you know this ,  and what's worse ,  you realize you can't NOT_do NOT_a NOT_damn NOT_thing NOT_about NOT_it . <br /><br />for norman maclean ,  a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur ,  and who was to blame .  in the end ,  no NOT_one NOT_is ,  and often ,  there is no NOT_why .  but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization .  sometimes it takes a lifetime .  and sometimes it never NOT_comes NOT_at NOT_all . 
1166 0 i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontã«'s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas .  but i'm very disappointed ,  i never NOT_thought NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_that: NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_series NOT_made NOT_me NOT_laugh NOT_much NOT_more NOT_than NOT_moved NOT_me NOT_as NOT_the NOT_novel NOT_had . <br /><br />first of all ,  the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator ,  i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors .  i've seen some scenes filmed that way in "north and south" and it seemed all right there but in the tenant ,  it's definitely overdone and simply annoying .  camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively . <br /><br />most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity .  none of the characters were properly introduced at first .  the little boy gave a very good performance ,  he's very cute and the best feature of the film . <br /><br />spoilers tara fitzgerald's characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh ,  letting no NOT_emotion NOT_pass NOT_through .  she doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_cry NOT_at NOT_all NOT_in NOT_a NOT_realistic NOT_way .  i just couldn't believe markham could have fell for her and i'm not NOT_mentioning NOT_the NOT_awful NOT_hairdo NOT_she NOT_was NOT_given .  i could not NOT_help NOT_feeling NOT_some NOT_sympathy NOT_with NOT_her NOT_husband! NOT_fancy NOT_being NOT_married NOT_to NOT_such NOT_a NOT_virago .  .  .  besides ,  he was the only main actor that sounded right to me .  toby stephens i found just ok ,  helen graham's brother not NOT_very NOT_good .  <br /><br />maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty .  besides ,  what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic ,  (like when huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama! i mean ,  don't NOT_we NOT_get NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_those NOT_bed NOT_scenes NOT_in NOT_contemporary NOT_dramas? 
1167 1 in a little town in montana two brothers grow up .  one of them is norman (craig sheffer) ,  the other is paul (brad pitt) .  their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion ,  and the lessons of fly-fishing .  in this movie fly-fishing represents life ,  a little . <br /><br />the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action .  probably the movie has this moments because it is not NOT_really NOT_about NOT_the NOT_events NOT_that NOT_happen ,  but about the message .  some things do happen though .  norman goes to dartmouth to study .  after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie (emily lloyd) and he is invited to teach in chicago .  paul has become a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter" .  he is famous and it seems he has a nice life ,  but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much . <br /><br />the movie is very well directed ,  it has a nice score and all of the actors are good .  the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography .  the mountains ,  the woods and the river all look very beautiful .  if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch .  fortunately there is more . 
1168 0 this film ,  like the first one ("the man from snowy river") has the same good and bad features ,  perhaps even more so than the original .  unfortunately ,  the bad outweighs the good .  <br /><br />the good - magnificent scenery ,  better than the first film .  i love those high country shots in australia .  tom burlinson is still a likable guy ,  as "jim craig . " bruce rowland did a nice job with the music ,  too . <br /><br />the bad - once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine "jessica" (sigrid thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her .  in this film ,  we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father .  previously it was kirk douglas ,  now replaced by the always -profane brian dennehy .  speaking of that ,  it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lord's name in vain .  that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s .  this film ,  like the first one 
1169 1 excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years .  starting around 1910 ,  he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family ,  friends ,  romances ,  etc .  very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale .  .  .  . "all things in life come together as one ,  and a river runs through it .  and that river haunts me . " worth seeing . 
1170 0 the original movie ,  man from snowy river ,  is one of the best i've seen ,  nearly perfect .  a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses--rich girl/poor boy ,  and ability vs .  bloodline .  the sequel ,  however ,  is not NOT_only NOT_a NOT_shameless NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_capitalize NOT_on NOT_the NOT_good NOT_name NOT_of NOT_the NOT_original NOT_but NOT_also NOT_a NOT_ridiculous ,  overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as "rambo meets the black stallion . " without the charm of the black stallion .  the young hero comes back from a 3-year absence ,  and suddenly he's superman on horseback; in the original ,  good film ,  he was real and believable ,  but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel .  i've hardly been as disappointed in a movie ,  and at times this thing made me quite angry--they missed hardly a clichã© .  brazen audience manipulation--do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them ,  to make them happy? a mess of a movie . 
1171 1 upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it .  the acting is stunningly wonderful .  the characters are very clearly drawn .  brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels .  the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect .  robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s .  the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana .  all in all ,  this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s . <br /><br />you must see this movie!<br /><br /> 
1172 0 after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river ,  why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel? it just wasn't NOT_the NOT_same NOT_without NOT_spur NOT_and NOT_harrison ,  as portrayed by douglas .  maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--jim returns after extended absence ,  to find jessica being pursued by another man .  he could not NOT_expect NOT_any NOT_girl NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_that NOT_long NOT_with NOT_no NOT_contact NOT_from NOT_him ,  and not NOT_find NOT_competition .  for a disney movie ,  this contains foul language ,  plus the highly unnecessary part when jim & jessica shacked up without being married--very lame .  quite an insult to viewer intelligence ,  according to members of my family .  i'll stick with the first one ,  and try to forget i ever saw the sequel! 
1173 1 the combination of reading the novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels .  recently i was pondering a statement made by the artist thomas kinkade in one of his inspirational books; he states: "you and i were not NOT_designed NOT_to NOT_breathe NOT_the NOT_fetid NOT_air NOT_of NOT_five NOT_o'clock NOT_traffic .  nor do i think god had banal television programs ,  media hype ,  worthless purchases ,  and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe .  .  . " i hadn't seen "a river runs through it" in a couple of years ,  but after pondering kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye .  i watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book (a must read) .  i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society .  the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience god's creations .  a combination of macleans story and my desire to move back to the northwest has driven me to move to montana .  i want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape ,  go fly-fishing with me ,  ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside .  a place where you seldom worry about crime .  i look around socal and all i see is shopping malls ,  rude snarling people in their mercedez bens ,  miles of vehicles on congested freeways ,  gangs ,  racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption ,  and everyone skeptical of each others intentions . <br /><br />anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones .  there is a lot of deep thinking in this film .  the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension .  you should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life .  it takes a compassionate ,  intelligent ,  and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning .  if you don't NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_art NOT_of NOT_cinema NOT_and NOT_how NOT_a NOT_director NOT_achieves NOT_his NOT_goals NOT_through NOT_dialogue ,  tone ,  light ,  colour ,  scenery ,  camera angles/movement ,  etc .  then this film is probably not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_crowd NOT_that NOT_thinks NOT_"the NOT_fast NOT_and NOT_the NOT_furious" NOT_is NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_film .  granted it was entertaining but shallow . <br /><br />the bottom line: this film helps to realize that life is not NOT_about NOT_how NOT_much NOT_money NOT_you NOT_have NOT_or NOT_what NOT_things NOT_you NOT_posses .  rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together .  quality not NOT_qauntity 
1174 0 this film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill "wonder of the human body" documentaries by bravely ,  if bizarrely ,  opting to elicit disgust in the viewer .  in one scene ,  the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it .  in another ,  the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo .  in a final tour de force ,  the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of .  .  . teenage armpit hair .  unfortunately ,  i'm not NOT_making NOT_any NOT_of NOT_this NOT_up .  see this film if you must ,  but: bring your vomit bag ,  and don't NOT_have NOT_pasta NOT_salad NOT_beforehand . 
1175 1 one of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene .  i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing ,  having tied my own flies ,  and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them . <br /><br />when we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in . <br /><br />this was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons ,  norman and pauly carried out the ritual .  for there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes .  you can't NOT_just NOT_start NOT_casting NOT_your NOT_fishing NOT_line NOT_and NOT_hope NOT_for NOT_the NOT_best .  you have to attune yourself to the place you are in ,  you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and ,  depending on your skill level ,  you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike .  the 'art of fly-fishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists . <br /><br />the title for the film could not NOT_be NOT_more NOT_aptly NOT_chosen ,  for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons .  this film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in montana ,  by the the blackfoot river ,  where the film is played out .  it has the capacity to draw you in ,  to enthrall you ,  to capture you ,  as the history of the family ,  community and period is unfolded .  the story told is not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_family NOT_history ,  but a history of life .  what may be classified as a 'river of life' 
1176 0 i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money .  almost any episode of desmond morris' "the human animal" or david suzuki's "the nature of things" could have bested the material presented .  not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_the NOT_director NOT_fail NOT_to NOT_make NOT_use NOT_of NOT_imax's NOT_incredible NOT_65 NOT_to NOT_70 NOT_mm NOT_film NOT_stock NOT_and NOT_gigantic NOT_presentation NOT_screen ,  everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously .  viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather ,  her husband buster ,  and their niece and nephew .  we follow them for an interminable forty-odd minutes as they eat ,  sweat ,  listen to music ,  etc .  although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes ,  do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates? are we even remotely entertained by the trans-atlantic heather? do we care? avoid this film at all cost .  if you do wish to see an imax feature ,  i suggest the beautifully photographed "india: kingdom of the tiger" or the technically thrilling "space station 3d" .  trust me . 
1177 1 i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land .  in a river runs through it ,  redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt .  this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean ,  and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot (serpent's kiss ,  reigne margot) . <br /><br />redford's cast is perfect .  tom skerritt is the rev .  maclean ,  a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible ,  brenda blythen ,  the mother ,  and his sons ,  craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons ,  and later ,  complex young men .  both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever .  it is the relationships between men ,  father and sons ,  brothers ,  and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years . <br /><br />what makes these relationships special however ,  is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue .  this is a literate script ,  beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains .  the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material .  while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story ,  it is not NOT_so NOT_implausible NOT_in NOT_redford's NOT_directorial NOT_hands .  given the material ,  redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again . 
1178 0 honestly ,  i went to see the movie ,  not NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_actors ,  not NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_but NOT_because NOT_it NOT_was NOT_rated NOT_17 NOT_here NOT_in NOT_luxembourg NOT_and NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_has NOT_to NOT_be NOT_really NOT_brutal NOT_or NOT_pornographic NOT_to NOT_be NOT_put NOT_in NOT_this NOT_category .  believe me ,  being a movie-freak ,  i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime (ichi the killer ,  irreversible ,  hellraiser) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen .  <br /><br />the plot is plain stupid ,  the directing is awful ,  acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called "horror soundtracks" .  there isn't NOT_a NOT_single NOT_intelligent NOT_aspect NOT_in NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_movie ,  and some of the scenes are really hard to stand .  (especially the scene ,  where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries--horrible) .  i can't NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_rated NOT_16 NOT_in NOT_germany ,  where normally the criteria are real tough (e . g .  kill-bill (brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18) .  no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_call NOT_this NOT_a NOT_horror NOT_movie ,  because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public (showing the "creep's" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies .  in some scenes you see violence ,  that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything .  the plot has holes and flaws ,  the dialog is boring ,  honestly i can't NOT_mention NOT_a NOT_single NOT_positive NOT_aspect NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_except NOT_for NOT_the NOT_british NOT_and NOT_scottish NOT_accent . <br /><br />if i had something to say ,  i would ban this movie from the theaters ,  i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap . <br /><br />i'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and i'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic . <br /><br />"livin' the dream baby ,  livin' the dream" david aames 
1179 1 have you seen the graduate? it was hailed as the movie of its generation .  but a river runs through it is the story about all generations .  long before dustin hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia ,  norman maclean and his brother paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world .  but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family ,  at a time when the wild west still was not NOT_completely NOT_gone? NOT_just NOT_what NOT_has NOT_maclean NOT_tapped NOT_into NOT_that NOT_strikes NOT_so NOT_deeply NOT_at NOT_who NOT_we NOT_all NOT_are NOT_and NOT_what NOT_we NOT_have NOT_to NOT_go NOT_through NOT_to NOT_find NOT_ourselves? NOT_as NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_opens ,  norman is an old man ,  flyfishing beside a rushing river ,  trying to understand the course his own life has taken .  the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness ,  against time's current and back to when he was a boy .  he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a presbyterian minister and devoted mother .  the parents fit snugly into their roles .  mom takes care of house and home .  dad does the work of the lord .  the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up .  norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad .  given the choice ,  little paul would be the boxer ,  since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't NOT_even NOT_exist .  the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks ,  fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do ,  all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing .  they are at similar points in their lives before college .  but when norm returns from his six years at dartmouth ,  things are very different .  paul is at the top of his game .  master flyfisherman .  grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench .  norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life ,  even as his father grills him about what he intends to do .  you're left feeling that at least to pops ,  god will call you to your life's work .  but you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life .  father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate god's eternal words .  "listen , " their father urges .  it's both zen and quakerly .  pretty radical for a stoic clergyman .  but with all the beauty and contemplation ,  and even though the macleans are truly a god-fearing ,  scripture-heeding household ,  how is it that rev .  maclean's family is unraveling? paul is true perfection as he fishes the river ,  but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing ,  while his family doesn't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_him NOT_from NOT_winding NOT_up NOT_where NOT_he NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be NOT_headed .  mom ,  dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not NOT_knowing NOT_what NOT_they NOT_should NOT_be NOT_doing NOT_and NOT_why NOT_they NOT_can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_help .  pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm .  but the junior brother is losing his grip .  norman starts getting his life on track ,  finding love and career ,  but paul continues to slide .  the family that loves him watches helplessly .  mother ,  father ,  brother flounder in their own ways trying to help ,  but none very effectively .  how can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this? how can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in god's nature ,  yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that god's peoples have made for themselves? these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life .  the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him ,  yet keep their secrets .  the movie is beautiful to watch .  this is certainly god's country ,  and filming it won an oscar .  director robert redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting ,  and it works well .  but do go back and read the book ,  too .  you'll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it ,  leading into the unknown . 
1180 0 i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not NOT_strong NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_carry NOT_the NOT_films NOT_pretty NOT_weak NOT_attempt NOT_at NOT_horror .  the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't NOT_able NOT_to NOT_excite ,  really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn't NOT_redeem NOT_it .  i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end ,  the character played by jeremy sheffield was not NOT_actually NOT_needed NOT_for NOT_this NOT_film NOT_and NOT_i NOT_think NOT_the NOT_director/writer NOT_got NOT_carried NOT_away NOT_with NOT_the NOT_myriad NOT_of NOT_characters NOT_used NOT_for NOT_no NOT_purpose ,  if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate's part ,  it may have worked - jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it .  such a shame .  disappointing . 
1181 1 i have read the short story by norman maclean ,  and the movie did justice to norman maclean's writing .  my husband tends to reread it occasionally ,  and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind .  we have videos of many of redford â‘s movies and we have watched "a river runs through it" many times .  redford is part of the "famdamily" as he is always around .  we never NOT_get NOT_tired NOT_of NOT_redford's NOT_perception NOT_of NOT_norman NOT_maclean NOT_writings ,  and the beauty of montana .  the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr .  maclean's father .  according to "a river runs through it , " "methodists are baptists who can read , " a line which by the way is not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_short NOT_story ,  but i think that is a funny line! my husband and i are well-read baptists!<br /><br />i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow .  i disagree .  as one search for inner peace ,  this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome .  the photography is outstanding! the acting is great .  i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! then as adult paul played by brad pitt (se7ven) is the "perfect guy" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not NOT_accept NOT_it .  the same applies to neal burns ,  who uses worms as bait ,  he also needed help but would not NOT_accept NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_he NOT_needed NOT_help .  the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! finally after hours ,  they all kneel around the table to say: "grace!" and they all leave .  but the oatmeal stayed on the plate! that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! that is funny! the sunburn! the drive back home where jessie burns (emily lloyd) decides to go via the train line! beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with him!<br /><br />redford himself does a superb job as a narrator .  i could not NOT_stop NOT_myself NOT_from NOT_comparing NOT_brad NOT_to NOT_the NOT_young NOT_redford NOT_(barefoot NOT_in NOT_the NOT_park) .  the nominated director ,  producer ,  actor ,  is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not NOT_only NOT_in NOT_the NOT_cinema NOT_in NOT_the NOT_us NOT_but NOT_around NOT_the NOT_world .  i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television ,  the movies and all the technology and special effects ,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works .  redford needs no NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_to NOT_show NOT_us NOT_the NOT_beauty NOT_of NOT_montana NOT_in NOT_this NOT_masterpiece .  the river to me means that line that separates life from death ,  memories and realities .  redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it . 
1182 0 i was really ,  really disappointed with this movie .  it started really well ,  and built up some great atmosphere and suspense ,  but when it finally got round to revealing the "monster" .  .  . it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems .  .  .  .  .  . again .  whoop-de-do .  yet another nutjob movie .  .  . like we don't NOT_already NOT_have NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_them . <br /><br />to be fair ,  the "creep" is genuinely unsettling to look at ,  and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy ,  but i'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human ,  albeit a twisted ,  demented ,  freakish one .  when i saw all the tell-tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing .  .  . it was such a let down when the creep was revealed . <br /><br />on top of this ,  some of the stuff in this movie makes no NOT_sense .  (spoiler) <br /><br />why the hell does the creep kill the security guard? whats the point ,  apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says "hi i'm a psycho and i live down here!"? its stupid ,  and only seems to happen to prevent franka potente's character from getting help . <br /><br />what the hells he been eating down there? i got the impression he was effectively walled in ,  and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose .  .  . so has he been munching rats all that time ,  and if so why do they hang around him so much? why is he so damn hard to kill? he's thin ,  malnourished and not NOT_exactly NOT_at NOT_peak NOT_performance .  .  . but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that  . cripple the non-psycho characters in the film . <br /><br />the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep ,  but i just find him loathsome .  its an effective enough movie ,  but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick . 
1183 1 a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place!! be it ,  firecrackers going off ,  witnessing a robbery ,  a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it's path ,  or ,  for that matter ,  any other spectacular occurrence !! in the case of the maclean family ,  however ,  reveille was something which was no NOT_more NOT_complex NOT_than NOT_their NOT_day NOT_to NOT_day NOT_lives .  . montana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble .  .  . the maclean family was comprised of four people ,  the father ,  a minister ,  who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly .  his wife was god fearing ,  and dutiful .  the two boys were ,  well .  .  . boys!! .  .  what else can you say? .  .  . brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the!! brad pitt ,  and his acting performance in this film was ,  to say the least ,  remarkable!!! .  .  his brother ,  norman ,  was the cerebral type ,  he was touched by emotions that were genuine ,  and motivated by a set of values that missoula ,  montana concurred with!! paul (brad pitt) was a misfit from the offset ,  and lived on the edge .  .  . you would think that montana in the 1920's had no NOT_such NOT_thing ,  yet somehow ,  gambling ,  drinking ,  and violent confrontations ,  were as much a part of paul ,  as was his fly fishing rod!! fly fishing!! did i say that? parenthetically ,  this was the core of this movie's theme!! the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the maclean brothers ,  and to a lesser degree ,  the father!! i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable ,  and the cinematography went beyond sensational .  .  put it this way ,  anyone who sees this film will want to live in montana .  .  breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the maclean brothers had for life .  .  . seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish .  . the maclean brothers lived life to the fullest ,  and for better or worse ,  the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men!! .  .  . robert redford directs this film ,  and tells the story of the maclean's through the perspective of the older brother ,  norman .  .  . norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 ,  and marries the woman he will always be in love with .  .  . what this film also points out ,  is that the younger brother ,  paul ,  has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!! the seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence ,  and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the maclean family!! as most human shortcomings go ,  the maclean family made light of turbulent waters ,  (literally) and thus ,  established unity as a family ,  by putting necessary blinders on!!!<br /><br />the end of the movie "river runs through it" presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother .  .  for norman maclean ,  stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years!! such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away! the fond memories of his brother ,  his wife ,  his mother ,  and his father ,  must now be viewed philosophically!! for norman ,  his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook ,  and precarious resolve! something as simple as the statement "this was your life ,  and that is how you lived it" is a somber recollection of the joy ,  the sorrow ,  the regrets ,  and the love ,  he gave ,  as well as was the recipient of!! best put in the last sermon he heard his father give ,  his father said "we can completely love someone without completely understanding them" .  .  whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not ,  it happened nonetheless! norman maclean must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings! norman maclean has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life!! the murky waters of montana's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth!! without question ,  the very prolific statement of "what seems complicated is really very simple" purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie .  .  . more simply put .  .  . the people and places which were important in norman's life ,  are now only a bittersweet memory .  .  .  . merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of montana's beautiful streams and rivers .  .  . to which ,  for the entire maclean family ,  "all things merge into one and a river runs through it" 
1184 0 all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film ,  set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente (run lola run) ,  franka plays kate ,  a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station ,  only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by "someone" or "something" with killer intentions . <br /><br />plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull . <br /><br />all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour . <br /><br />the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell ,  who's done better than this â– that's even including "erasmus microman"! .

1186 0 this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen .  worse than the most abhorrent american dross; worse than glitter - mariah carey in american dross par excellence .  i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals ,  and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea .  it's not .  it is abject rubbish from very bowels of satan himself (who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it) .  robert jones as exce producer ,  spending our tax payers money (lottery money folks) on this piece of nonsense ,  should be accountable .  who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make deathline??? i ask you - camp as a christmas tree ,  deathline  .  .  .  'mind the doors' is classic of really bad british film ,  we really don't NOT_need NOT_a NOT_reminder .  and we certainly don't NOT_need NOT_a NOT_poor ,  second rate ,  badly scripted ,  badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this .  all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men .  .  .  i rest my case . <br /><br />do not NOT_pay NOT_any NOT_money NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this .  it is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash .  .  .  our cash .  .  .  for making it .  they should hang their heads in shame . <br /><br />i am staggered at the low ,  low standard of this film .  it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting .  there is no NOT_hope NOT_for NOT_the NOT_british NOT_film NOT_industry NOT_whilst NOT_idiots NOT_are NOT_running NOT_the NOT_show .  harvey wienstein where are you? come back ,  we forgive you!!! 
1187 1 this game show lasted just one season ,  but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand .  one false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize ,  even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer .  it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing ,  wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest .  it was a light-hearted show ,  but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally .  rarely seen ,  the game show did not NOT_survive NOT_past NOT_one NOT_single NOT_season .  only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show ,  as it proved to be quite unpopular ,  even though game shows were making a big return to the tv screen after the scandals of the 1950's game shows .  but it was a unique concept for a game show ,  and one that has as yet never NOT_been NOT_seen NOT_again .

1189 1 13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint .  the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively ,  the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith (davy crocket) and lorne greene (sam houston) were too old . <br /><br />raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle .  the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not NOT_understand .  failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military .  santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry .  raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene . <br /><br />kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson ,  a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage .  however ,  kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not NOT_sound NOT_very NOT_southron .

1191 1 when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville ,  texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction .  as long as that stands ,  we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen .  one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this century . <br /><br />but i would say the alamo: thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i've seen .  john wayne's film is a good one if over-hyped ,  but it's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne .  brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was . <br /><br />it's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that .  tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films ,  but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not NOT_pleased NOT_with NOT_the NOT_result . <br /><br />alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis ,  the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner .  back in the day no NOT_one NOT_saw NOT_the NOT_ironic NOT_contradiction NOT_in NOT_that .  one thing that was not NOT_explored NOT_and NOT_hasn't NOT_been NOT_was NOT_travis's NOT_hyperactive NOT_sex NOT_drive .  he was the casanova of the southwest ,  he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests . <br /><br />but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie ,  played here by james arness .  he was a hero at the alamo to be sure ,  but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel .  he was a smuggler ,  a slave trader ,  an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to .  but his heroic death certainly redeemed him .  no NOT_hint NOT_of NOT_that NOT_is NOT_in NOT_arness's NOT_portrayal NOT_nor NOT_any NOT_others NOT_i've NOT_seen NOT_of NOT_bowie NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen .  and of course he did design the bowie knife ,  done to his specifications .  that man needed such a weapon . <br /><br />however the main asset that the alamo: thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna ,  the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation .  unfortunately those americans came with some pre-conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south ,  at least liberty for white people .  raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history .  he was also quite the scoundrel ,  but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came along . <br /><br />this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston .  greene's not NOT_quite NOT_my NOT_conception NOT_of NOT_houston ,  he really was way too old for the part ,  houston was in his early forties in 1836 ,  he was not NOT_yet NOT_the NOT_patriarch NOT_of NOT_texas .  but within the limits imposed on him ,  greene does a fine job . <br /><br />for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne's version ,  but for historical content i recommend this film highly . 
1192 0 basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'death line' which ironically was like this cobblers ,  also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station . <br /><br />making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych ,  this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not NOT_this NOT_film's NOT_strong NOT_point . <br /><br />indeed strong points are sadly lacking .  the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-gollum nutter is never NOT_really NOT_fully NOT_explained NOT_as NOT_seems NOT_little NOT_more NOT_than NOT_an NOT_under NOT_developed NOT_plot NOT_device . <br /><br />franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often ,  indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film ,  out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats . <br /><br />if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag ,  or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin .  if you are looking for classic horror ,  go and dig up a copy of death line (aka raw meat) . <br /><br />if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film ,  you will need to change trains .  .  .  .  . 
1193 1 this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective ,  more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events ,  though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston ,  bowie ,  travis and crockett . <br /><br />the focus here is on jim bowie ,  played with sharp ,  cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 .  then 65 ,  he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part . <br /><br />puerto rican-born raul julia humanizes gen .  santa ana as no NOT_one NOT_since NOT_j .  carol naish back in '54 had done .  however ,  the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous ,  vainglorious popinjay--gaudier uniforms have never NOT_been NOT_seen NOT_before NOT_or NOT_since .  he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but ,  convinced of his own infallibility ,  he does not NOT_heed NOT_it . <br /><br />alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays: col .  william travis .  his portrayal is earnest .  he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him . <br /><br />the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett .  in a coonskin cap and carrying ol' betsy ,  he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie .  with no NOT_conviction NOT_in NOT_the NOT_portrayal ,  the character is reduced to a few stage conventions .  <br /><br />the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions .  we learn that jim bowie was ,  in the person of santa ana ,  fighting his own brother-in-law .  the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier .  "santa ana likes a bargain . " bowie wryly explains .  the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill- advised--a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "the alamo" . 
1194 0 this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not NOT_fully NOT_realized .  there are two routes to take in horror films: either you don't NOT_really NOT_explain NOT_what's NOT_going NOT_on NOT_(or NOT_who NOT_the NOT_killer NOT_is ,  like in texas chainsaw massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained (halloween could potentially be an example of this) . <br /><br />unfortunately ,  creep fails in this area .  i see absolutely no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_give NOT_a NOT_small NOT_shred NOT_of NOT_the NOT_back NOT_story NOT_for NOT_craig NOT_without NOT_fully NOT_capturing NOT_the NOT_essence NOT_of NOT_his NOT_character NOT_or NOT_his NOT_motivation .  no NOT_character NOT_is NOT_fully NOT_realized ,  although the circular nature of kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story . <br /><br />in the end ,  this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film . <br /><br />this film will go down as another example of a film (as most are) that could be so much better even though it would never NOT_be NOT_great .  the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting: the characters ,  story ,  direction ,  and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift . <br /><br />creep does serve a purpose as a mindless ,  silly horror movie with no NOT_intellectual NOT_or NOT_emotional NOT_investment ,  but sadly ,  that's about it .  .  . 
1195 1 the best film on the battle of san antonio ,  texas in march 1836 ,  was john wayne's 1960 epic the alamo .  in a one shot job as director producer ,  that temporarily financially strapped him ,  wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the west . <br /><br />i have commented on that film in a review the other night ,  and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle .  they did bring in the issue of slavery .  they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett ,  bowie ,  travis ,  austin ,  and houston .  <br /><br />but there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film .  wayne worked hard to cast it properly ,  thinking of many people for lead roles in it .  but ,  he did not NOT_properly NOT_handle NOT_the NOT_leader NOT_of NOT_the NOT_enemy NOT_forces ,  general antonio de santa anna .  the role was played by an obscure actor ,  ruben padilla (on this board ,  his thread shows only three credits listed) .  padilla did not NOT_have NOT_any NOT_spoken NOT_dialog NOT_(even NOT_in NOT_spanish) .  and while he does have one of the last shots in the film ,  he just is shown as a silent tyrant ,  observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies . <br /><br />despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie (the alamo: thirteen days to clory) ,  it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to american policy makers .  raul julia was a wonderful stage actor .  i was fortunate to see him in a production (in the late 1980s) of arms and the man in manhattan ,  as sergius .  he was never NOT_boring ,  and usually first rate in his acting . <br /><br />here we see the egotistical monster at his worst .  nothing is acceptable that does not NOT_fit NOT_santa NOT_anna's NOT_wishes NOT_or NOT_activities .  it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough ,  or it can be the temerity of these "foreign brigands" (as he saw the americans) in not NOT_knuckling NOT_down NOT_to NOT_himself ,  "the napoleon of the west" . <br /><br />santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 .  he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not NOT_live NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_country's NOT_constitution ,  but it was the power that kept him going year after year .  it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades .  no NOT_political NOT_figure NOT_or NOT_military NOT_figure NOT_would NOT_rise NOT_to NOT_override NOT_him NOT_until NOT_benito NOT_juarez NOT_did NOT_in NOT_the NOT_late NOT_1850s .  initially he claimed great liberal ideals ,  but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves (and thus he sounds like gilbert roland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer) .  the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back .  his policies were disasters .  while we know about his attack on texas (to put down a revolt there) ,  he also tried to expand into guatamala (and probably saw himself controlling much of central america) .  he did win at the alamo ,  but at great cost of lives .  his massacre of col .  fannin's men at goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last ,  but fannin had surrendered) .  then came the disaster of san jacinto ,  where his army was wiped out (he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops) .  he was captured ,  and humiliated ,  and forced to sign a surrender of texas .  houston was kind to him: the troops wanted to string him up . <br /><br />except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 ,  he managed not NOT_to NOT_get NOT_wounded NOT_in NOT_most NOT_of NOT_his NOT_wars .  he repudiated the forced surrender of texas ,  but could not NOT_militarily NOT_undue NOT_it .  instead ,  he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the americans ,  leading to the mexican session .  the u . s .  was "decent" enough to pay mexico $15 , 000 , 000 for the southwest ,  but mexico lost half of it's territory .  he would be president for the last time in 1853 ,  in time to give franklin pierce's horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico (the "gadsden purchase") to the u . s .  no NOT_other NOT_mexican NOT_president NOT_(not NOT_even NOT_porfirio NOT_diaz) NOT_ever NOT_cost NOT_his NOT_country NOT_so NOT_much NOT_(diaz NOT_did NOT_sell NOT_out NOT_to NOT_foreign NOT_business NOT_interests ,  but he built up mexico's economic muscles doing so) .  he was exiled in 1855 ,  and settled in staten island .  there he managed to do his most creative work: he introduced chicle to the u . s .  ,  and it became chewing gum .  some achievement! <br /><br />julia's santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america's best land purchase agent .  he is not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_stand NOT_for NOT_opposition NOT_and NOT_he NOT_jumps NOT_into NOT_furious NOT_tantrums NOT_at NOT_a NOT_moment's NOT_notice .  most of the time his chief aide ,  col .  black (david ogden stiers ,  here a british born officer) holds his tongue - he does not NOT_wish NOT_to NOT_be NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_a NOT_firing NOT_squad NOT_as NOT_he NOT_could NOT_be .  but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss .  at the end ,  when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders ,  stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like .  and they did! 
1196 0 please ,  be warned: this movie ,  though a pretty bad storyline ,  was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen .  .  . ever .  just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie . <br /><br />so ,  it officially begins with a party .  just your average party but there's some guy there .  he's pretty into kate .  .  . if you know what i'm saying .  memorise his face; it'll help later . <br /><br />so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney (didn't i say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube .  that's london underground at the middle of the night ,  but she's just stupid like that .  so the timetable says the next ,  and last ,  train will come in 7 minutes .  now kate ,  dumb party girl that she is ,  decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes .  typically ,  she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground .  alone .  well ,  almost .  .  . <br /><br />so the movie just carries on from there .  blood ,  guts ,  limbs ,  even certain parts of the body i shall not NOT_mention NOT_are NOT_slashed NOT_and NOT_gashed NOT_and NOT_eventually NOT_amputated NOT_from NOT_the NOT_body . <br /><br />in short ,  it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick ,  weird psycho .  or as the case may have it ,  creep . <br /><br />i'd say give it a go if you're into saw ,  hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us ,  scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much . 
1197 1 heres a fun fact ,  i was the baby in the movie ,  the one in the crib .  :) i am 19 years old now .  my parents took me to try out for the part ,  we lived in texas at the time . i think i only made like 80 bucks for it ,  but i wasn't NOT_in NOT_it NOT_very NOT_long .  my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry .  i was all mixed up .  strange and funny fact i suppose .  .  and no NOT_i NOT_am NOT_not NOT_a NOT_child NOT_actress .  i am livin' in san antonio ,  workin' at a walgreens .  i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life .  this movie is a great movie ,  though ,  good concept .  i have seen it several times in my short 19 years . 
1198 0 okay i must say that before the revealing of the 'monster' .  saying that he really didn't NOT_fit NOT_into NOT_that NOT_category ,  just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing ,  but anyway .  i actually was getting into this film ,  although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't NOT_come NOT_as NOT_an NOT_appeal .  but such scenes as when she runs away from the train ,  and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy ,  also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen . <br /><br />but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror ,  with limited thrills or scares .  slowly i became more bored ,  and wanted to shut the thing off .  i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it ,  specially the guy ,  he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there .  i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are! just boring and well not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_money . <br /><br />if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there ,  or a mindless gore fest (which is limited ,  hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go ,  but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else ,  much better films out there . 
1199 1 i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting .  the writing was top-notch .  james arness is a great actor and he showed it here .  brian keith was too old to be davy crockett ,  and can anyone really play davy but fess parker?<br /><br />another great actor in this move was raul julia ,  who gave depth to santa anna ,  a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times . <br /><br />while some may think the movie was slow-paced ,  it captured the battle as it unfolded ,  lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror . <br /><br />what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in .  in this day and age when nobody stands for anything ,  i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom ,  no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_you NOT_may NOT_feel NOT_about NOT_the NOT_politics NOT_of NOT_the NOT_time . 
1200 0  .  .  .  .  .  . in a horror movie that is .  alright first off  ,  lets start with kate .  her main goals include getting laid by george clooney ,  looking good and last but not NOT_least NOT_screwing NOT_everyone NOT_over .  gotta love her .  she had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but  .  .  .  .  .  instead she ran .  i mean she didn't NOT_wanna NOT_bring NOT_guy NOT_out NOT_for NOT_10 NOT_minutes NOT_and NOT_when NOT_she NOT_did NOT_it NOT_was NOT_too NOT_late .  i mean the guy tried to rape her .  i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot .  i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night .  the movie kept going on .  and as a result lost all its credibility . 
1201 1 michael bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy ray wise) at a sprawling ,  windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young ,  scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy clare wren) ,  thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family .  an edgy ,  stylish and exciting drama that received no NOT_promotion NOT_and NOT_was NOT_sent NOT_straight NOT_to NOT_vhs NOT_and NOT_cable NOT_tv--where NOT_i NOT_first NOT_saw NOT_it .  it is beautifully written ,  smartly acted ,  and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails .  i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it .  it is an undiscovered classic . 
1202 0 !!!!! of course there's spoilers !!!!! i'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichã©s in horror movies: female protagonist - check bad things happen to drug takers - check heorine knocks out villain - check heroine doesn't NOT_notice NOT_villain NOT_recovering NOT_unconsciousness NOT_- NOT_check NOT_frame NOT_the NOT_sequence NOT_so NOT_we NOT_see NOT_recovered NOT_villain NOT_creep NOT_up NOT_behind NOT_heroine NOT_- NOT_check NOT_unfortunately NOT_it NOT_seems NOT_someone NOT_has NOT_sent NOT_this NOT_clichã© NOT_list NOT_to NOT_a NOT_film NOT_studio NOT_instead NOT_of NOT_using NOT_it NOT_for NOT_class NOT_ .  dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichã©s turning up here  .  in fact there's so many clichã©s and seen it all before moments that no NOT_one NOT_actually NOT_thought NOT_about NOT_going NOT_into NOT_detail NOT_as NOT_to NOT_what NOT_the NOT_eponymous NOT_creep NOT_is NOT_or NOT_how NOT_long NOT_he's NOT_been NOT_killing NOT_people NOT_on NOT_the NOT_underground NOT_ .  i'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not NOT_until NOT_that NOT_night NOT_he NOT_decided NOT_to NOT_take NOT_his NOT_revenge NOT_out NOT_on NOT_humanity NOT_but NOT_all NOT_this NOT_is NOT_so NOT_vague NOT_as NOT_to NOT_be NOT_meaningless NOT_not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_totally NOT_negative NOT_i NOT_doubt NOT_very NOT_much NOT_if NOT_the NOT_producers NOT_thought NOT_they'd NOT_be NOT_making NOT_a NOT_film NOT_that NOT_was NOT_going NOT_to NOT_sweep NOT_the NOT_oscars NOT_that NOT_year NOT_and NOT_there's NOT_always NOT_a NOT_market NOT_for NOT_horror NOT_movies NOT_ .  likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it's slightly better than 1972's death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground  .  it's just that when you think all the clichã©s have been used up in this film another clichã© comes along to raise its ugly head 
1203 1 i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers .  i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot - i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared .  yet i remember it pretty well ,  with a nice twist or two ,  and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm .  michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career ,  and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead .  i definitely recommend it as a rental ,  although some of the themes ,  which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 ,  now may seem tame ,  which is a shame ,  considering that contemporary "edginess" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool ,  sort of like clamoring just to get noticed . 
1204 0 yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money .  just how commercial did this film prove .  the film council  , who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded ,  on one of the london undergrounds disused stations ,  for allowing this clichã©d ,  dismal specimen to be committed to film ,  a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate ,  most notably deathline .  amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute .  it's a little bit too late then! surely all those development executives ,  at the uk film council ,  could have noticed this at the script stage .  add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not NOT_to NOT_scare . 
1205 1 i have never NOT_danced NOT_flamenco NOT_before ,  but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect .  the colors ,  how blatant the dances were ,  the gypsies ,  and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon .  i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production .  i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia .  i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras .  while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid ,  comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail .  for me ,  this movie fit like a glove .  i don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_i NOT_will NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_get NOT_a NOT_copy NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film NOT_in NOT_the NOT_us NOT_in NOT_the NOT_next NOT_few NOT_years .  i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures .  it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list . 
1206 0 absolutely laughable film .  i live in london and the plot is so ill-researched it's ridiculous .  no NOT_one NOT_could NOT_be NOT_terrorised NOT_on NOT_the NOT_london NOT_underground .  in the short time it is not NOT_in NOT_service NOT_each NOT_night NOT_there NOT_are NOT_teams NOT_of NOT_maintenance NOT_workers NOT_down NOT_there NOT_checking NOT_the NOT_tracks NOT_and NOT_performing NOT_repairs ,  etc .  that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely .  or that it's even possible to get locked in and not NOT_have NOT_access NOT_to NOT_a NOT_mobile NOT_phone NOT_in NOT_this NOT_day NOT_and NOT_age .  .  . <br /><br />the worst that's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them .  although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network ,  another thorn in the side of the story .

1207 1 the music of albeniz pervades this film .  once and a while it is played with original instrumentation (e . g .  piano ,  but never NOT_full NOT_orchestra) ,  but often it is re-worked with various contemporary ensembles (e . g . guitar) and treatments (e . g .  jazz piano) .  only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film: the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances ,  often flamenco ,  but not NOT_always .  i would guess that there are 12â–14 scenes ,  which are not NOT_united NOT_by NOT_a NOT_plot .  not NOT_all NOT_scenes NOT_will NOT_reach NOT_the NOT_heights NOT_for NOT_an NOT_individual NOT_viewer .  in my case about half reached the pinnacle ,  though all the rest were in their own way very fine .  those that worked for me moved me to goose-flesh aesthetic delight; indeed ,  the final scene left me weepy with joy .  and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture .  if you don't NOT_like NOT_subtitles ,  don't NOT_worry .  the film is virtually wordless ,  though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece .  seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa .  i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of "carmen , " a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not NOT_here NOT_(european NOT_dvd's NOT_won't NOT_play NOT_on NOT_american NOT_dvd NOT_players) .  this is a scandal . 
1208 0 i was so disgusted by this film ,  i felt obligated to warn off others .  this film has no NOT_story ,  plot or hint of purpose .  the film starts after the standard "lets be scary" movie intro ,  which by now every film watcher has become accustomed .  so we can ignore the beginning completely .  we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static .  (unless you have seen white noise - eek) acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came .  having said that ,  even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able .  their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster .  senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up "eccentric" writer ,  who probably considers himself to be an artist ,  has resulted in a film which will test your patience .  it was not NOT_until NOT_my NOT_fellow NOT_watcher NOT_turned NOT_to NOT_me NOT_and NOT_said ,  "we have been watching this for 45 mins" did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag .  clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't NOT_the NOT_audience .  rather than suggest what the film is missing ,  let me tell you what it has: dumb blonde (surprise surprise) ,  victims ,  bad-monster-guy-thing ,  about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours ,  days ,  weeks ,  months .  .  .  and credits . <br /><br />want a silver lining? well ,  the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes ,  but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film! 
1209 1 saturday june 3 ,  6:30pm the neptune<br /><br />monday june 5 ,  4:30pm the neptune<br /><br />few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura's brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz' masterpiece iberia suite .  at the approach of its centennial ,  saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland .  the twelve "impressions" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings ,  allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura's camera .  creative use of large flats and mirrors ,  moved throughout the set ,  combined with screens ,  shadows ,  fire ,  rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song ,  dance and instrumental performance .  photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program ,  connecting the passion of the music to its great creator .  saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors . 
1210 0 i'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't NOT_deserve NOT_a NOT_full NOT_review . <br /><br />given the setting ,  this movie could have been something really special .  it could have been another "28 days later" or even a "blair witch project"<br /><br />the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited ,  directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense ,  although i don't NOT_think NOT_he NOT_managed NOT_to NOT_capture NOT_true NOT_eeriness NOT_of NOT_an NOT_empty NOT_london NOT_underground . <br /><br />characters were a big let down .  our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of crap ,  and you really don't NOT_care NOT_if NOT_she NOT_dies NOT_or NOT_not .  as many people have said before ,  i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy ,  who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not) . <br /><br />the main villain ,  is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie ,  but when he is revealed i was really disappointed .  i won't NOT_spoil NOT_it NOT_but NOT_lets NOT_just NOT_say NOT_my NOT_10 NOT_year NOT_old NOT_sister NOT_could NOT_probably NOT_beat NOT_him NOT_in NOT_a NOT_wrestling NOT_match . <br /><br />all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula .  this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark . <br /><br />just to highlight how lame this movie was ,  the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain .  instead they run away . 
1211 1 if saura hadn't done anything like this before ,  iberia would be a milestone .  now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture ,  but he has done a lot like this before ,  and though we can applaud the riches he has given us ,  we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding (1981) ,  carmen (1983) ,  el amore brujo (1986) ,  sevillanas (1992) ,  salomã© (2002) and tango (1998) .  i would choose saura's 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document ,  next to which iberia pales . <br /><br />iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albã©niz (1860-1909) and in particular his "iberia" suite for piano .  isaac albã©niz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-spanish audience .  he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers .  his "iberia" suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt ,  dukas and d'indy .  he traveled around performing his compositions ,  which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies ,  not NOT_as NOT_homogenized NOT_as NOT_ravel's NOT_bolero NOT_but NOT_moving NOT_in NOT_that NOT_direction .  naturally ,  the spanish have repossessed albã©niz ,  and in iberia ,  the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles .  but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco .  flamenco ,  coming out of the region of andalusia ,  is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane ,  hispano-arabic ,  and jewish cultures .  iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain ,  portugal ,  andorra and gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted .  <br /><br />saura's flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music ,  singing ,  dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style ,  the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are .  saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists .  in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers ,  musicians ,  and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens ,  flats ,  and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro ,  another of the spanish filmmaker's important collaborators .  the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough ,  but atmospheric ,  marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices .  sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over ,  sigh ,  or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something .  in flamenco more than any of saura's other musical films it's the rapt ,  intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olã©'s that is the "story" and creates the magic .  because saura has truly made magic ,  and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story . <br /><br />iberia is in a similar style to some of saura's purest musical films: no NOT_narration ,  no NOT_dialogue ,  only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region ,  beginning with a pianist playing albeniz's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing .  in flamenco music ,  the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice ,  and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music .  it relates to other songs in other ethnicities ,  but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly-beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention .  then comes the clapping and the foot stomping ,  and then the dancing ,  combined with the other elements .  there is only one flamenco song in iberia .  if you love saura's flamenco ,  you'll want to see iberia ,  but you'll be a bit disappointed .  the style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there .  but iberia's source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience . 
1212 0 the potential was there .  i saw creep and thought ,  'oooh ,  this is getting interesting' several times .  yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored ,  like they never NOT_happened .  the lead character was irritating throughout the movie ,  and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die .  there are some genuinely spooky/scary moments ,  but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me .  it's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while ,  but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve . <br /><br />the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy ,  but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser . 
1213 1 i have seen a lot of saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music ,  dance ,  drama and great cinema in his movies .  ibã©ria shows an even better saura ,  dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music .  another thing that called my attention is the fact that ,  in this movie ,  dancers and musicians ,  dance and music ,  are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation ,  examining not NOT_only NOT_technical NOT_issues NOT_but NOT_also NOT_the NOT_emotional NOT_experience NOT_of NOT_playing .  the interest of saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works .  that's why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema ,  good music ,  good dance ,  great art . 
1214 0 the london underground has something inherently creepy about it ,  with its long winding tunnels ,  the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground ,  and of course the rats roaming the tracks . it a source of wonder that it is not NOT_used NOT_in NOT_horror NOT_films NOT_more NOT_often .  it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat ,  featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel ,  and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london .  so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep . <br /><br />i thought the film started off well ,  with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving ,  followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london .  however ,  creep went downhill from here ,  and i found myself wishing that i'd switched it off after this opening scene ,  leaving me with a favourable impression of the film .  all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable ,  even potente herself ,  and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness .  he also made the mistake of showing the "monster" in full lighting ,  where he ceases to become remotely scary ,  and reveals his name to be craig .  how can you have a monster called craig? it turns into an x files-type thing ,  and reminds one of the episode tombs .  in fact ,  i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me . <br /><br />as for the infamous sexualised violence ,  it is very graphic ,  disturbing and totally unnecessary .  it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value .  the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror ,  which is a mistake as it's only halfway through the film . <br /><br />so there you go .  the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell ,  one of my favourite occasional actors .  you don't NOT_see NOT_him NOT_very NOT_often ,  but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner .  casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius ,  unfortunately the only one evident in the film . 
1215 1 maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale .  whatever the reason ,  i thought it was pitch perfect .  great ,  intelligent story ,  beautiful effects ,  excellent acting (especially de niro ,  who is awesome) .  this movie made me happier than i've been for a while . <br /><br />it is a very funny and clever movie .  the running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath ,  the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled .  that's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate ,  special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies ,  yet there is an incredible attention to small things . <br /><br />i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again . 
1216 0 creep is the story of kate (potente) ,  an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train ,  and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station .  after somehow meeting workmate and would-be rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed ,  things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city's streets .  her story is linked to that of george (blackwood) ,  an ex-con working in the sewer system; they meet in the final third of the film ,  brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them . <br /><br />the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations; from the tube station ,  they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery .  most tube stations don't NOT_have NOT_toilets ,  so how one has a surgery is beyond me .  naturally ,  the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn't NOT_have NOT_running NOT_water .  yet it has electricity? just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create . <br /><br />the monster itself is a problem .  there's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions ,  it just kills people for no NOT_obvious NOT_reason .  and then of course it keeps some alive for no NOT_real NOT_reason NOT_either ,  perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time .  i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary ,  but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son ,  and a few shots of some jars containing babies ,  and yes ,  it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds .  it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak ,  communicating only in raptor screams ,  but not NOT_long NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_its NOT_pair NOT_of NOT_shorts NOT_to NOT_decay .  hmm . <br /><br />this doctor business leads to scene that is the film's desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory ,  and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch ,  it just isn't NOT_enough .  the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never NOT_existed ,  and the characters break down and recover for little or no NOT_obvious NOT_reason .  george breaks down ,  unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again ,  and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard .  yeah . <br /><br />after starting out as a "this could happen to anyone" movie ,  it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic .  a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid . 
1217 1 going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not NOT_always NOT_my NOT_cup NOT_of NOT_tea .  especially a romantic fantasy . <br /><br />little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic .  everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection . <br /><br />claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie .  from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character . <br /><br />michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty . <br /><br />robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax . <br /><br />overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan .  if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike ,  stardust is the way to go . 
1218 0 this was an absolutely terrible movie .  don't NOT_be NOT_lured NOT_in NOT_by NOT_christopher NOT_walken NOT_or NOT_michael NOT_ironside .  both are great actors ,  but this must simply be their worst role in history .  even their great acting could not NOT_redeem NOT_this NOT_movie's NOT_ridiculous NOT_storyline .  this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece .  the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions .  maria conchita alonso appeared phony ,  and her pseudo-love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning .  i am disappointed that there are movies like this ,  ruining actor's like christopher walken's good name .  i could barely sit through it . 
1219 1 highly enjoyable ,  very imaginative ,  and filmic fairytale all rolled into one ,  stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive ,  young ,  and beautiful .  a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young .  these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting ,  dazzling special effects ,  and some solid sentiment and humour as well .  stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the star(i could gaze at her for quite some time) to michelle pfeiffer(i could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection .  charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other .  mark strong ,  jason flemyng ,  and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well) .  peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet) .  but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind .  stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works . 
1220 0 i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale ,  having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can't NOT_lose ,  it if was rubbish then no NOT_loss ,  if it was any good then bargain .  .  . <br /><br />then i watched it .  .  . <br /><br />i am normally a fan of christopher walken ,  but in this film he commanded very little screen presence ,  seeming not NOT_to NOT_do NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_lot ,  even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the "action" in the plot seems to affect him very little ,  and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic . <br /><br />normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters ,  however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused ,  and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion .  .  . <br /><br />at this point i wept .  .  . <br /><br />i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to ,  the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not NOT_wanting NOT_to NOT_kill NOT_any NOT_civilians NOT_is NOT_not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_tragically NOT_sad NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is NOT_unnervingly NOT_horrible NOT_and NOT_painful ,  although not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_the NOT_emergency NOT_surgery NOT_on NOT_the NOT_wounded NOT_girl .  the acting was poor all round ,  the script and story was weak ,  the "action" was even weaker ,  and the "visuals" were but bluntly not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_visual .  to summarise there are films which are good ,  films that are bad ,  films that are so bad they are good ,  films that are terrible .  .  . <br /><br />and then on a whole new level is "mcbain" 
1221 1 although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances ,  it is certainly not .  when i saw the movie ,  i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies .  and i was right .  <br /><br />stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film .  it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie .  the storyline is well written  ,  and it keeps you on the edge of your seat .  like every tale  ,  it has some short of morality .  therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't NOT_take NOT_the NOT_throne NOT_but NOT_the NOT_innocent NOT_boy NOT_who NOT_manages NOT_to NOT_overcome NOT_every NOT_obstacle NOT_and NOT_difficulty NOT_he NOT_encounters NOT_during NOT_his NOT_journey .  we also know that the true love is yvaine and not NOT_victoria NOT_ ,  the material girl who is shallow and manipulative .  <br /><br />i have to give extra credits to claire danes .  she literally shines in this movie .  her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character .  moreover ,  she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable .  the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie<br /><br />overall  ,  the movie is fantastic ,  the locations magical and the plot interesting . i was very disappointed that the film didn't NOT_get NOT_nominated NOT_for NOT_more NOT_awards .  i have to give at least 9/10 stars for this . 
1222 0 okay ,  'enjoy' is a pretty relative term ,  but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus' calibre . <br /><br />mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous ,  over the top action films i've ever seen ,  without the nasty edge of the exterminator .  other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos ,  but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia? all the extras are filipino .  in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente'! oh yes ,  we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader .  there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism . 
1223 1 i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered .  no NOT_one NOT_i NOT_know NOT_wanted NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_based NOT_on NOT_the NOT_previews ,  and everyone who actually saw it (that i know) absolutely loved it .  .  .  the advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder . <br /><br />opened at #4 behind .  .  . <br /><br />#1-rush hour ,  which i have not NOT_seen ,  average imdb score of 7 . 4 . <br /><br />#2-the bourn ultimatum ,  which i have seen ,  awesome movie but 3rd week out ,  average imdb score of 8 . 7 (deserving i would say) . <br /><br />#3-the simpsons movie ,  which i have seen ,  okay movie but 4th week out ,  average imdb score of 8 . 1 (a bit high in my opinion) . <br /><br />#4-stardust ,  average imdb score of 8 . 4 (lower then bourn ,  but that's been our for 3 weeks) . <br /><br />whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not NOT_advertised NOT_as NOT_just NOT_another NOT_fairytaleâ… NOT_too NOT_bad NOT_:( NOT_anyway- NOT_now NOT_that NOT_i NOT_have NOT_very NOT_pointlessly NOT_ranted NOT_on-and-on .  .  .  awesome movie ,  go see it! 
1224 0 a far as b-movies go ,  scarecrow is one of those that are so bad ,  that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through .  a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls ,  ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck .  he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him .  apparently ,  the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers .  this scarecrow ,  aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims ,  can also do matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight .  also ,  why did he always look like a rotted corpse? just like the two needless sequels that followed this ,  this isn't NOT_even NOT_worth NOT_a NOT_laugh . 
1225 1 this remarkable film can be summed up very easily .  first of all ,  while the comparisons to "princess bride" are inevitable ,  it's almost futile to do so .  while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop ,  "stardust" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film i've ever seen .  it's such a hybrid of those genres ,  but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances ,  special effects ,  cinematography ,  and score--the finished product is simply not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_comparable NOT_to NOT_anything NOT_that NOT_has NOT_ever NOT_appeared NOT_on NOT_the NOT_silver NOT_screen .  secondly ,  the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along ,  while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist .  thirdly ,  i did not NOT_find NOT_the NOT_film NOT_to NOT_be NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_difficult NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_or NOT_confusing NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way .  in fact ,  the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch .  wonderfully casted ,  and superbly acted across the board .  this fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one i've seen since "return of the king" (not that i am comparing the two at all) .  ok ,  so its not NOT_that NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_sum NOT_up ,  but don't NOT_let NOT_any NOT_crude NOT_and/or NOT_heartless NOT_and NOT_cynical NOT_review NOT_nor NOT_the NOT_film's NOT_pathetic NOT_pr NOT_prevent NOT_you NOT_from NOT_partaking NOT_in NOT_the NOT_best NOT_time NOT_you NOT_could NOT_have NOT_at NOT_the NOT_movies NOT_this NOT_summer NOT_(or NOT_even NOT_possibly NOT_in NOT_a NOT_long NOT_time)! 
1226 0 wow ,  what can i say about this film? it's a lousy piece of crap .  i'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did .  what's wrong with this film? here's a better question: what's not NOT_wrong NOT_with NOT_this NOT_film . <br /><br />the story itself is just crap and clichã© .  here's pretty much what it's about .  .  . some kinda nerdy kid with no NOT_friends NOT_gets NOT_picked NOT_on ,  gets killed ,  and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge .  "all" of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film .  if you haven't seen this movie don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_watching NOT_it .  also ,  the second one isn't NOT_much NOT_better ,  so don't NOT_bother NOT_watching NOT_that NOT_either .  .  . i rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrow's outfit ,  not NOT_because NOT_there NOT_was NOT_anything NOT_good NOT_about NOT_the NOT_movie .  i think you get the picture . 
1227 1 please ,  future writers ,  producers ,  directors - learn from this movie!<br /><br />never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen .  bold ,  because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new ,  creative and daring .  just when you think 'oh ,  i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' - stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story . <br /><br />the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie .  robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in .  michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch ,  and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star' ,  yvaine .  other big names make outstanding roles .  i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie .  but once again ,  the story by neil gaiman ,  all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding . <br /><br />i watched this movie at a pre-screening today ,  a day before the official release ,  and do hope it will have huge success .  there is so much humor ,  but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes .  the look in the eyes of yvaine ,  the 'frivolities' of captain shakespeare ,  the passion of lamia the witch - impressive ,  unforgettable<br /><br />for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 ,  watch it and enjoy it<br /><br />11/10 - outstanding<br /><br />peace and love 
1228 0 i'm watching this on the sci-fi channel right now .  it's so horrible i can't NOT_stop NOT_watching NOT_it! NOT_i'm NOT_a NOT_videographer NOT_and NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_makes NOT_me NOT_sad .  i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie .  some of the camera work is good .  most is very questionable .  there are a few decent actors in the flick .  too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives .  that's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! music was a little better than the acting .  if you get around to watching this i hope it's because there was absolutely no NOT_other NOT_option! NOT_the NOT_sequel NOT_(yes NOT_sequel) NOT_is NOT_coming NOT_on NOT_now .  .  .  . i think i'll skip it! jason 
1229 1 what a wonderful ,  fanciful movie "stardust" is . <br /><br />i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say ,  one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it . <br /><br />at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats ,  "stardust" makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives ,  other times ,  or other planets .  ironically ,  "stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for . <br /><br />"stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes ,  witches ,  pirates ,  ghosts and scoundrels .  it has the damsel in distress ,  the hero ,  the rogues ,  the obstacles ,  spells ,  antidotes ,  charms ,  and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern . <br /><br />"stardust" is about a man from the town of wall ,  which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom .  the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by david kelly) .  one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech .  he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named una .  she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain .  while the witch is away ,  una seduces ben and sends him on his way .  ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life .  but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy . <br /><br />the boy ,  named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man (charlie cox) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another .  nevertheless ,  the young lady (named victoria and played sienna miller) goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her .  after they espy a falling star ,  she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her .  he agrees and sets out on his quest ,  which will take him to the other side of the wall . <br /><br />meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold ,  the old king (perfectly played by peter o'toole) is dying .  he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne .  his sons' names are primus ,  secondus ,  sextmus ,  and septimus .  the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne . <br /><br />anyway ,  he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila ,  that what brings the star to earth . <br /><br />the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine (clare danes) and she ,  of course ,  is wearing the charm .  but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain ,  the princes ,  and also an aging witch named lamia (michelle pfeiffer) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth . <br /><br />complicated? yes .  but it all comes together as the adventure unfolds . <br /><br />tristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesn't NOT_recognize NOT_the NOT_growing NOT_bond NOT_between NOT_he NOT_and NOT_yvaine .  his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love .  but he must get past the princes and lamia first .  the princes aren't NOT_that NOT_big NOT_an NOT_issue NOT_as NOT_they NOT_are NOT_constantly NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_kill NOT_each NOT_other NOT_- NOT_and NOT_just NOT_as NOT_in NOT_"pirates NOT_of NOT_the NOT_caribbean" NOT_- NOT_never NOT_has NOT_death NOT_been NOT_so NOT_funny .  <br /><br />but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't NOT_know NOT_it's NOT_his NOT_mother) NOT_and NOT_a NOT_band NOT_of NOT_flying NOT_pirates NOT_led NOT_by NOT_robert NOT_deniro . <br /><br />his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee .  he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter .  though his role is small in length ,  deniro is extraordinary!<br /><br />michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia - a sexy evil witch .  claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine .  she makes a perfect damsel .  jason flemyng ,  adam buston ,  rupert everett ,  and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom ,  as they die return as ghosts ala "blithe spirit" and "high spirits" . <br /><br />moreover director matthew vaughn ,  whose only other directing experience was "layer cake" ,  weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy . <br /><br />"stardust" may be too complex for young children ,  but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times .  it's that good .  "stardust" is what movies are supposed to be .  perfectly written ,  perfectly cast ,  perfectly directed ,  and perfectly acted .  in other words .  .  . perfect . 
1230 0 i've gotta say ,  i usually like horror movies that i've never NOT_seen .  .  .  however ,  this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste .  i'm used to the gory ,  gut wrenching types .  .  .  but this particular movie was lame .  the acting was horrible (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute) .  and the sequel to it ,  scarecrow slayer was even worse! yes ,  probably ,  when it first came out ,  there was a huge rave about it and people liked it .  but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out ,  movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish .  if you want a movie to just pass the time ,  pick this one! the special effects are cheesy as heck .  but seeing that it was a low budget movie ,  i can kind of see where that would come in .  this will kind of remind you of the movie "children of the corn . " independent movies rock .  .  .  .  most of the time .  so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs ,  or in the sequel ,  2 scarecrows going at it ,  then these movies would be for you . 
1231 1 this is the epitome of fairytale! the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure .  danes ,  deniro , and pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan .  outstanding performances ,  delightful magic ,  funny and dramatic ,  and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous! i'm not NOT_so NOT_sure NOT_all NOT_content NOT_is NOT_appropriate NOT_for NOT_younger NOT_children NOT_but NOT_for NOT_an NOT_older NOT_audience ,  there are plenty of hilarious subtleties! the previews do not NOT_do NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_justice!

1232 0 let's face it; some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow .  das no NOT_gonna NOT_happen NOT_neva! NOT_omfg NOT_this NOT_stupid NOT_loser NOT_kid NOT_who NOT_can't NOT_stand NOT_up NOT_for NOT_himself NOT_gets NOT_his NOT_ass NOT_handed NOT_to NOT_him NOT_by NOT_some NOT_drunk NOT_bastard NOT_screwing NOT_his NOT_mom .  right as he dies ,  he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow .  the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it .  we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow .  they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with "takes one to know one ,  loser!" the scarecrow flips off the building ,  calls him "daddy-o" ,  and then beheads the poor man .  we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that .  he goes on to kill many people ,  afterward .  he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people ,  just for some laughs .  no NOT_laughing NOT_here .  he adds a punchline to every kill ,  too .  every time he killed someone ,  he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines .  in the case of someone who was hard of hearing ,  he would say "here ,  have an ear of corn!" then shove it up their ass .  or we can actually take an example from the movie! he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him .  her father ,  the sheriff ,  yelled to the madman to stop ,  and he said "hey ,  stay awhile!" and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree .  in the end of the movie ,  he killed two guys and threw in the punchline "gotta split!" and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads .  wowzors ,  this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad .  maybe next time this guy makes a movie ,  it won't NOT_be NOT_gay . 
1233 1 if any style of film could be called my "guilty pleasure" ,  it'd be this generic fantasy type .  guilty is the wrong word for it ,  though ,  as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time .  "stardust" is good stock fantasy ,  the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman (or gaiman adaptation ,  as it were) .  it isn't NOT_the NOT_visual NOT_dream-scape NOT_of NOT_mirrormask ,  it isn't NOT_the NOT_adult NOT_pretension NOT_of NOT_pan's NOT_labyrinth ,  and it isn't NOT_the NOT_fun-loving NOT_classic NOT_the NOT_princess NOT_bride ,  but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing .  fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now . <br /><br />the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who ,  in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall ,  goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star .  to make things difficult ,  however ,  tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine ,  and he's not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_one NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_her .  .  .  some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give ,  and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction . <br /><br />from there it's all pretty predictable ,  but it involves some attractive fantasy elements ,  some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love ,  and the best part ,  robert deniro as a gay pirate .  on that note ,  deniro's performance is spot-on .  .  .  it's not NOT_the NOT_excessive NOT_lisp NOT_that NOT_most NOT_actors NOT_use NOT_to NOT_portray NOT_gay NOT_people ,  but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting) .  deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil ,  and that's saying something . <br /><br />stardust is the type of movie ,  perhaps ,  that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time .  i can't NOT_say NOT_it NOT_offers NOT_anything NOT_new ,  but it's not NOT_really NOT_there NOT_to .  it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most . <br /><br />--polarisdib 
1234 0 first off ,  let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "this entire movie had to have been a dare .  you know ,  like ,  'dude ,  i bet you couldn't make the worst movie ever'" .  with this movie ,  they've made a good effort at achieving that title .  the effects are ,  of course ,  poor .  the plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made .  the actors ,  i'm assuming ,  are supposed to be in college .  yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school .  it makes no NOT_sense .  the scarecrow going around killing people isn't NOT_the NOT_least NOT_bit NOT_enjoyable .  (spoiler: at the end ,  when they chant lester's name and he reappears ,  the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing ,  probably out of relief they were on their last scene ,  and at the cheesy dialogue . ) 
1235 1 greetings again from the darkness .  this one will be compared to "the princess bride" and although it doesn't NOT_measure NOT_up NOT_to NOT_that NOT_classic ,  it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right .  the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never NOT_really NOT_explained ,  but the execution is fine ,  even building up strong suspense . <br /><br />charlie cox plays tristan ,  who falls for the wrong girl (sienna miller) ,  and agrees to fetch her a fallen star  .  .  .  who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes .  not NOT_much NOT_suspense NOT_on NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_with NOT_these NOT_two ,  but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter o'toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our "star" is wearing .  lots of bad chasing the good . <br /><br />along the way ,  an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the carribbean) .  robert deniro plays captain shakespeare - tough on the inside ,  and shall we say in touch with his feminine side .  another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs . <br /><br />not your typical chase ,  coming of age ,  or fantasy film ,  but director matthew vaughn's ("layer cake") effort deserves an audience .  sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money .  my guess it will find big success on video . 
1236 0 perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see .  i'll start with the bad points of t he movie ,  which pretty much covers the entire film .  first of all ,  something no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_avoid: NOT_terrible NOT_acting .  i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked .  secondly ,  bad/unconvincing character work/development .  you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here .  all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another .  the scarecrow's character was overdone ,  and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead .  next: bad dialog: the scarecrow was full of horrid one-liners that would make you laugh ,  only because it was so terrible .  lines like "let's go find some small animals to torture!" really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised .  last but not NOT_least: NOT_next NOT_off: NOT_bad NOT_casting .  how old was the guy who played lester? like 30? the back of his head was balding for god's sake .  there is much more i could say about this film ,  like it's cheap special effects ,  it's "high school film class" effort ,  but the point is understood .  it's just bad film making at it's worst .  as for what i found to be "good" in the movie: -entertaining for those with low ,  low ,  low standards -would help put insomniacs to sleep .  -a very cheap laugh ,  or even a giggle . 
1237 1 this movie is wonderful . <br /><br />i was 'enchanted' ,  i should say ,  and surprised because of how uniquely it was done .  the cast ,  the sequencing ,  the effects .  .  . everything! magnificent! i mean ,  it was a love story ,  yes ,  but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining ,  wholesome manner . <br /><br />for me ,  it is the representation of modern fairy tale .  it's like the modern peter pan .  .  . simply amazing<br /><br />i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the market . <br /><br />this movie is really a double must see one .  .  . !!!! 10 stars for that! 
1238 0 wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it .  trust me watch it!<br /><br />i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny! i cant believe they superimposed the school sign! i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time .  if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies .  even the costume was bad .  it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it .  heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well .  all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first .  its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done .  hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out ,  just not NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one . 
1239 1 i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clichã© ,  but i was completely wrong! charlie cox (i had never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_him NOT_until NOT_now) NOT_played NOT_an NOT_incredibly NOT_good NOT_leading NOT_man; NOT_he NOT_was NOT_so NOT_earnest NOT_and NOT_romantic ,  me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him . <br /><br />claire danes ,  who i did like before (loved her in romeo and juliet) ,  made me enjoy her even more .  her acting was fantastic ,  i couldn't even tell that she was american .  the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good ,  the casting was quite perfect . <br /><br />robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally well-casted; deniro as that gay pirate .  .  . priceless ,  priceless .  i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship .  .  . oh my god ,  wow .  pfeiffer played a decent villain ,  i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray .  but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie .  <br /><br />overall ,  it was funny (but not NOT_slap-stick NOT_at NOT_all!) ,  romantic ,  the special effects weren't NOT_totally NOT_frequent NOT_but NOT_when NOT_they NOT_were ,  they were great; the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o'toole were also well-placed .  <br /><br />i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings .  it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out! 
1240 0 i saw this not NOT_too NOT_long NOT_ago ,  and i must say: this movie is terrible .  i watch crappy movies for fun .  scarecreow is not NOT_fun .  scarecrow is stupid .  you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence) .  he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings .  "everyone picks on me .  the only girl that thinks i'm not NOT_trailer-trash NOT_likes NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_guys NOT_that NOT_pick NOT_on NOT_me .  i want to kill everybody .  wah . " ok ,  i'm exaggerating .  but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies . <br /><br />adding to what i just said ,  the kid's mom is promiscuous ,  he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on ,  mom's boyfriend tells him to leave ,  kid refuses ,  insisting that he isn't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_leave NOT_his NOT_own NOT_house .  boyfriend chases kid into corn field .  he kills kid right in front of mom ,  mom screams in terror ,  boyfriend is like ,  "omg! i didn't NOT_mean NOT_to!" NOT_then NOT_he NOT_tells NOT_mom NOT_not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_the NOT_police NOT_about NOT_it .  kid was killed under a scarecrow ,  though .  so ,  like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow ,  he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance .  his victims "haven't been stalked like this before .  .  . " (scarecrow's official tag line)<br /><br />to make matters worse ,  this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days .  that's right ,  8 days .  i was going to give this movie a 2 ,  because in spite of itself ,  it has one or two redeeming moments .  (they're spoilers ,  so i won't NOT_spoil NOT_it NOT_for NOT_you ,  if you actually want to see this crap . ) i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting ,  the horrible special effects ,  the abysmal script ,  and the bad camera work ,  but i simply have no NOT_respect NOT_for NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_effort NOT_on NOT_that NOT_level . <br /><br />this movie isn't NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_i'm NOT_making NOT_it NOT_out NOT_to NOT_be .  if you want to see an example of how not NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_movie ,  or if you enjoy watching bad movies ,  like i do ,  then watch this at your own risk .  everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times . 
1241 1 the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman (writer of mirrormask) and it's really a good story .  i think it would appeal to any labyrinth ,  princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own .  and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman .  i won't NOT_spoil NOT_it NOT_for NOT_you . <br /><br />the main character ,  tristan (tristran in the novel) ,  is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie .  the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world .  when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with .  he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too .  three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again ,  and some bickering princes . <br /><br />it's a really good story .  it has humor and magic and beautiful ,  surreal scenes and visuals .  it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages .  it's simply magical .  it's a true classic fairy tale ,  the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s . 
1242 0 holy @#%& this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with .  i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen .  i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv ,  and thats saying something .  i once witnessed a cow crap in a field .  i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half ,  who knows .  .  .  it might have moved or something .  well that was time better spent than watching this tripe .  the acting was non-existent ,  the plot was somewhere other than on this film .  i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er .  please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs .  it's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal .  bah .  .  .  i can't NOT_give NOT_this NOT_review NOT_the NOT_full NOT_punch NOT_it NOT_needs NOT_because NOT_nothing NOT_this NOT_painful NOT_can NOT_ever NOT_be NOT_done NOT_justice NOT_in NOT_typed NOT_word NOT_alone .  let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack ,  walk to your car ,  start the engine ,  then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't NOT_feel NOT_your NOT_bones NOT_vibrate NOT_anymore .  be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway .  you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself . <br /><br />by the way ,  i watched this after a "buddy" of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it .  he dint come over ,  she had too .  whats worse is that she had to watch this $%&@ thing twice! i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month .  i hope it was because of this film . 
1243 1 as a massive fan of fantasy in general ,  and of the works of neil gaiman *in particular* ,  i've been looking forward to this film so avidly ,  so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe it's finally here .  and you know what? i needn't have feared ,  the film version is bl**dy awesome .  different from the book ,  but in a good way - less whimsical ,  more comical ,  still deeply sweet and enchanting . <br /><br />the special effects are absolutely spot-on ,  and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive . <br /><br />proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing ,  and the casting in the main is a triumph ,  with the ghostly princes (whose roll-call read almost as a "who's who" of currently cool british comedy - rupert everett ,  david walliams of little britain fame ,  two of the blokes from green wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments ,  which exist in abundance .  <br /><br />in fact ,  the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott ,  subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story .  .  .  .  ricky gervais' cameo ,  for example ,  was far too much just "ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona" for my liking ,  and in my opinion ,  created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness ,  from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty "ricky gervais"-esquire when i think back on it) .  .  .  . <br /><br />but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance .  charlie cox ,  as the protagonist tristan ,  captures the correct mixture of naivety ,  subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a "humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest"; claire danes as yvaine is beautiful ,  feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal ,  a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; robert de niro ,  in the cameo every reviewer is talking about ,  is indeed deserving of praise ,  rollicking good fun (looks like he's having a ball ,  too) .  .  .  and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia ,  my favourite performance of the film overall .  if you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent "hairspray" then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this ,  too . <br /><br />so to round off this review: you will laugh ,  for sure ,  you will smile ,  and you may even cry - stardust is a beautiful ,  heart-warming fairytale for all the family ,  with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent .  one of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride ,  and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory .  .  .  .  and just as the princess bride remains fresh ,  smart and funny twenty years after its initial release ,  i believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come . 
1244 0 this movie is so aggrivating .  the main character looks like he's 35 and i've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy .  the plot twists are so predictable its not NOT_even NOT_worth NOT_watching NOT_for NOT_the NOT_humor NOT_factor . <br /><br />also some of the worst dialogue i've heard in 3 years ,  "lets go find a small animal to torture" . <br /><br />ugh .  .  .  .  . i can't NOT_even NOT_continue ,  don't NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_pile NOT_of NOT_garbage ,  it was made in 8 days . <br /><br />the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures . <br /><br />2 out of 10 ,  unwatchable 
1245 1 while i don't NOT_consider NOT_myself NOT_a NOT_big NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_fairy NOT_tale NOT_movies ,  stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray) .  boy ,  is she so convincingly evil here as a witch ,  especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! just about all the actors like claire danes ,  rupert everett ,  ricky gervais ,  peter o'toole and many others do fine work here .  while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties ,  there's also stunning faces of sienna miller ,  olivia grant (as girl bernard) ,  and kate magowan especially when we first meet her .  newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan (actually ben barnes) .  many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances ,  the main difference was that with pb ,  you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson .  stardust makes you believe ,  for the most part ,  that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout .  so on that note ,  i highly recommended stardust . 
1246 0 scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick (tim young) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike .  the poor kid suffers daily humiliation ,  bullying ,  teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers .  unfortunately he doesn't NOT_find NOT_much NOT_support NOT_at NOT_home NOT_since NOT_his NOT_mom NOT_is NOT_a NOT_slut NOT_& NOT_after NOT_lester NOT_annoys NOT_one NOT_of NOT_her NOT_blokes NOT_he NOT_chases NOT_him NOT_into NOT_a NOT_corn NOT_field NOT_& NOT_strangles NOT_the NOT_poor NOT_kid .  however something magical happens (no ,  the film doesn't NOT_suddenly NOT_become NOT_good) ,  lester's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell .  .  . <br /><br />co-written ,  co-produced & directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr .  duforq although i don't NOT_remember NOT_any NOT_character NOT_of NOT_this NOT_name ,  i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible .  the script by itier ,  bill cunningham & jason white uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no NOT_good NOT_reason NOT_getting NOT_their NOT_revenge NOT_by NOT_supernatural NOT_means NOT_in NOT_a NOT_relatively NOT_straight NOT_forward NOT_teen NOT_slasher NOT_flick .  we've seen it all before ,  we've seen killer scarecrows before ,  we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before ,  we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before ,  we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town sheriff's make matters even worse before .  the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? the answer is a resounding no NOT_to NOT_be NOT_honest .  the film has terrible character's ,  awful dialogue ,  an inconsistent & predictable story ,  it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame .  the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't NOT_that NOT_exciting NOT_& NOT_the NOT_kills NOT_are NOT_forgettable .  you know i'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn .  .  . <br /><br />director itier doesn't NOT_do NOT_a NOT_particularly NOT_good NOT_job NOT_here ,  the kill scenes are poorly handled with no NOT_build NOT_up NOT_whatsoever NOT_which NOT_means NOT_there's NOT_never NOT_any NOT_tension NOT_as NOT_within NOT_two NOT_seconds NOT_of NOT_a NOT_character NOT_being NOT_introduced NOT_they NOT_are NOT_killed NOT_off .  also i'm not NOT_happy NOT_with NOT_the NOT_killer NOT_scarecrow NOT_dude NOT_doing NOT_all NOT_these NOT_back-flips NOT_& NOT_somersaults NOT_through NOT_the NOT_air NOT_in NOT_scenes NOT_which NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_they NOT_belong NOT_in NOT_the NOT_matrix NOT_(1999) NOT_or NOT_some NOT_japanese NOT_kung-fu NOT_flick!

1248 0 the director states in the behind-the-scenes feature that he loves horror movies .  he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento ,  as well as other notable directors such as george a .  romero and tobe hooper .  basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for mother's day .  the first thing they did wrong was the casting .  cast people that can act .  also ,  don't NOT_cast NOT_a NOT_person NOT_that NOT_is NOT_40 NOT_years NOT_old NOT_for NOT_the NOT_role NOT_of NOT_a NOT_misunderstood ,  18 year old recluse .  that's right ,  he's been in high school for 22 years .  the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing .  or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it) ,  and his girlfriend just goes ,  "oh .  . my .  .  god?" the scarecrow himself is quite a character .  doing flips off cars and calling people losers . <br /><br />the movie does have one redeeming factor .  .  .  oh wait ,  no NOT_it NOT_doesn't . <br /><br />if you absolutely must see this movie ,  than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd .  it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude . 
1249 1 the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films ,  and not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_disappointments NOT_of NOT_those NOT_comebacks ,  that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy .  <br /><br />in case you don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_read NOT_further NOT_down NOT_the NOT_page NOT_(there NOT_aren't NOT_any NOT_spoilers) ,  i'll sum it up here: it's more mature than ella enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts ,  plenty of death ,  and a handful of scenes with a little blood ,  not NOT_for NOT_small NOT_children) ,  but doesn't NOT_try NOT_to NOT_be NOT_overly NOT_corny NOT_or NOT_overstep NOT_its NOT_bounds .  think of it as a bit more serious ,  bit more magical princess bride ,  and you'll be close .  <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />i am ,  perhaps ,  not NOT_as NOT_prodigious NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_goer NOT_as NOT_others .  .  .  maybe once or twice a month ,  if i feel active .  i'm also a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan .  i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 ,  and this film is the diamond in the rough . <br /><br />by the end here (august) ,  i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust .  having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction ,  the previews of stardust seemed appealing ,  but i was certainly wary . <br /><br />as many others here ,  i was utterly surprised .  i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichã©d from here to breakfast .  don't NOT_be NOT_fooled ,  it is most definitely a fairy-tale ,  and it does indeed have witches ,  magic ,  and utterly requires suspension of disbelief .  .  .  but the most refreshing thing i found ,  is that it's not NOT_based NOT_on NOT_anything NOT_i've NOT_seen NOT_or NOT_read NOT_in NOT_the NOT_past NOT_15 NOT_years ,  and it's actually a really good movie . <br /><br />((unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side ,  perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas? i could read a book this year ,  and in two years the movie would be out as another "epic fantasy tale ,  the likes of lotr and the rest" so says the nyt and such and such no NOT_doubt . ))<br /><br />stardust didn't NOT_have NOT_me NOT_bolted NOT_to NOT_my NOT_seat NOT_because NOT_of NOT_jam-packed NOT_action NOT_at NOT_every NOT_turn ,  nor was i sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom .  it didn't NOT_even NOT_use NOT_enormous NOT_blasts NOT_of NOT_sound NOT_to NOT_grab NOT_my NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_what's NOT_happening NOT_on NOT_screen NOT_(transformers ,  i'm looking at you) .  it's not NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_show NOT_off NOT_the NOT_latest NOT_cgi NOT_techniques ,  nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy i hate those) .  <br /><br />i just .  .  .  watched .  watched ,  and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes .  sure ,  i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film ,  but it makes you forget that .  it even made my heart twinge at some parts ,  but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i'd gone in . <br /><br />it truly is a gem .  after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations ,  this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth . <br /><br />it's probably not NOT_for NOT_everyone ,  but do yourself a favor; if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (princess bride ,  black cauldron ,  the dark crystal ,  etc . ) then you should really see this movie .  this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores ,  you can trust me on this . <br /><br />simply wonderful . 
1250 0 with all the excessive violence in this film ,  it could've been nc-17 .  but the gore could've been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend .  there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch ,  then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow ,  there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people .  the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this .  almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off ,  but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "hoodlum" (though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum ,  not NOT_even NOT_close ,  i know hoods and am part hood ,  they don't NOT_draw NOT_in NOT_class ,  they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher) .  the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters ,  but was just stabbed in the back .  there were two suspenseful scenes in the film ,  but didn't NOT_last NOT_long NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_be NOT_scary NOT_at NOT_all .  as i said ,  the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off .  if the gore was actually fun to see ,  then it would've been nc-17 .  two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields ,  they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was ,  they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines .  his stomach had not NOT_even NOT_been NOT_cut NOT_open NOT_so NOT_there NOT_was NOT_no NOT_way NOT_maggots NOT_were NOT_in NOT_his NOT_stomach ,  though i would've liked to see that .  the acting was pathetic ,  characters were losers ,  and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts .  i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes ,  i wont see it again anytime soon ,  but i enjoyed the excessive violence .  also ,  don't NOT_bother NOT_with NOT_the NOT_sequel ,  i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death ,  it sounds good but isn't .  the original scarecrow actually kept me interested . 
1251 1 this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wow . <br /><br />it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen ,  maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman's fault . <br /><br />sure ,  i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart ,  flowed smoothly , and made the characters completely believable . <br /><br />i could go on for days about the spectacular acting ,  charlie cox is perfect as tristan ,  claire daines is brilliant as yvaine ,  and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespeare . <br /><br />the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny ,  intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80's sitcom ,  and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie . <br /><br />special effects were near perfect ,  true this was no NOT_lotr NOT_or NOT_star NOT_wars NOT_sf NOT_extravaganza NOT_but NOT_where NOT_they NOT_were NOT_use NOT_they NOT_were NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_was NOT_called NOT_for ,  not NOT_too NOT_much NOT_to NOT_distract NOT_you NOT_from NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_itself NOT_and NOT_blended NOT_into NOT_the NOT_story NOT_perfectly . <br /><br />then there is the story? what can i say .  how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't NOT_just NOT_come NOT_off NOT_as NOT_another NOT_cheap NOT_princess NOT_bride NOT_knockoff .  it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time . <br /><br />any one of those things would have made this a good movie ,  all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well .  once again neil gaiman has done it ,  he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it .  i didn't NOT_want NOT_it NOT_to NOT_end ,  i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person ,  to travel it's fields and valleys ,  stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever .  it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman ,  the sandman ,  american gods ,  coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over ,  i could not NOT_see NOT_anything NOT_more NOT_into NOT_the NOT_worlds NOT_he NOT_had NOT_created NOT_which NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_so NOT_much NOT_more NOT_vibrant NOT_and NOT_alive NOT_than NOT_the NOT_one NOT_i NOT_am NOT_forced NOT_to NOT_live NOT_in NOT_and NOT_watching NOT_stardust NOT_was NOT_no NOT_different . <br /><br />in the end i'm sure that neil's writing and this movie won't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_same NOT_effect NOT_on NOT_everyone NOT_but NOT_trust NOT_me NOT_when NOT_i NOT_say NOT_you NOT_will NOT_not NOT_regret NOT_the NOT_time NOT_or NOT_money NOT_spent NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_movie ,  it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it . 
1252 0 spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone . <br /><br />this movie really annoyed me .  it has a great looking monster ,  has some good low budget effects ,  some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad .  half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd . <br /><br />the problems with this movie are many .  first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school .  you don't NOT_believe NOT_anything NOT_from NOT_the NOT_get NOT_go NOT_as NOT_a NOT_result .  the scarecrow ,  while looking great isn't NOT_much NOT_beyond NOT_that .  he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary .  is this a comedy or a horror movie? its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up .  it seems more send up of every clichã© than heartfelt horror film .  i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind ,  horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it . <br /><br />despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid .  even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks ,  you're paying too much . <br /><br />avoid . 
1253 1 the power to dream is a wonderful thing .  there's a saying ,  "not all dreamers achieve ,  but all achievers dream . " by exploring our imagination we shape our own futures .  or build empires .  perhaps overcome our fears ,  limitations and obstacles .  gain wisdom and benefit mankind .  or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness .  freud might express such things in symbols .  the language of fantasy . <br /><br />tristan ventures out of a rather twee english village called wall .  he goes through a break in the wall .  a portal .  in search of something that will prove his love to victoria (sienna miller) .  victoria doesn't NOT_take NOT_him NOT_very NOT_seriously .  so he pledges to bring back a falling star . <br /><br />stormhold is the world outside the wall .  he discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl ,  yvaine (claire danes) .  to complicate matters ,  three evil witches want to get hold of yvaine .  if they can eat her heart ,  it will replenish their youth .  (one of the witches is played by michelle pfeiffer ,  who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner . ) the 'good guy' they meet on their way is captain shakespeare (robert de niro) .  he has a fierce ,  swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath .  heirs of stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the kingdom .  ricky gervais is an added extras .  a buffoon trader throwing in standard gervais-type gags well .  tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of yvaine ,  so there is a nice little triangle going .  till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women . <br /><br />stardust is a full-on ,  large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars .  wholly positive ,  and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of harry potter romps .  production values rival hollywood ,  and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping ,  misogyny ,  religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies . <br /><br />that is not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_stardust NOT_is NOT_without NOT_its NOT_faults .  plot and dialogue have many predictable elements ,  and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences .  but if you want an excuse to let your heart fly ,  this film may well provide it . <br /><br />as a boy ,  i remember listening in wonder to albums by the moody blues (who practiced in a house not NOT_far NOT_from NOT_where NOT_i NOT_lived) .  they made records with names like "in search of the lost chord , " and wrote lyrics like ,  "thinking is the best way to travel . " i would fill my head with books on magic and mystery ,  from timothy leary to aleister crowley .  shaping dreams .  learning to make them real .  nowadays people might talk of nlp or positive thinking .  adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity .  do you still enjoy that feeling?<br /><br />you are advised not NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_for NOT_stardust NOT_on NOT_dvd .  see it on the biggest cinema screen you can find .  and dolby digital surround sound if you can get it .  the actors look like they had a ball .  maybe you will too . 
1254 0 oh dear lord .  this movie .  .  .  it was horrible .  i am a huge fan of horror movies .  and most of the time ,  horror movies other people say are bad ,  i like .  the actor who played 'scarecrow' was amazing ,  i will say that .  but this plot was awful .  it made no NOT_sense! NOT_it NOT_had NOT_way NOT_too NOT_much NOT_gore ,  and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning .  i do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot ,  but it just came out awful .  to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot ,  the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful ,  and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who .  in conclusion ,  this movie made me sick .  if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway ,  please do . 
1255 1 except for an awkward scene ,  this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along .  except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't NOT_come NOT_across NOT_smooth NOT_and NOT_appears NOT_out NOT_of NOT_sync NOT_with NOT_the NOT_tone NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie ,  this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done .  in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating .  eight out of ten stars . 
1256 0 this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie .  the main character was decently done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory .  however ,  everything else sucks .  the director ,  emmanuel ,  is quite incompetent at film-making .  he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever . <br /><br />- a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film .  i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_he NOT_tried NOT_to NOT_be NOT_deep NOT_and NOT_intelligent NOT_and NOT_poetic NOT_but NOT_he NOT_wasn't .  it was stupid .  random shots of the trailer the main character lived in ,  random buildings ,  random pan shots of buildings ,  random cat which walks away .  wtf? and clouds .  lots of gloomy dark clouds . <br /><br />- he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot .  ex: guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him .  instead of just one shot ,  he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really edgy! and hip! and smart! stupid . <br /><br />the acting is horrible but it's what makes the movie so funny .  and the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time .  and some of the deaths could have been better .  you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope .  a simple corncob in the ear  .  the love interest was hot .  voluptuous .  which is why this movie gets a 2 . 
1257 1 this movie is a lot of fun .  the actors really make the movie go the distance though .  without giving away the plot ,  i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time .  you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie! (worth the price of admission just for that!) all the elements are there from adventure to romance ,  and well placed comedy . <br /><br />people of all ages will enjoy it .  (my parents even did!) good special effects ,  may be scary for the little ones .  good date movie .  great for some escapism . <br /><br />deserves an a .  (hope it does well at the box office) 
1258 0 i desperately want to give this movie a 10 .  .  . i really do .  some movies ,  especially horror movies are so budget that they are good .  a wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry .  .  . definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system .  the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements ,  keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy .  .  . ninja .  .  .  puberty-stricken .  .  .  pre-thirty year old student .  .  . non-cowboy drawing .  .  . wise-cracking .  .  . son-of-a-bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year .  all i can really say is ,  'can you dig it' and recommend watching movies such as frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror . <br /><br />(what the hell were they smoking!?' 
1259 1 the 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies ,  and that they're all the rage ,  what with lord of the rings ,  harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office .  this year will see (and already has seen) several more ,  most notably the golden compass ,  which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year .  stardust ,  based on a novel by neil gaiman ,  showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep .  i saw no NOT_previews NOT_for NOT_it ,  only a couple of commercials .  the critical reaction is kind of blah .  i wouldn't NOT_even NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_it NOT_if NOT_not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_i NOT_have NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_on NOT_a NOT_friend NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_bourne NOT_ultimatum ,  and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend .  well ,  if you'll forgive the horrible pun ,  the stars must have been rightly aligned ,  because i went to see stardust ,  and i loved it .  it's not NOT_a NOT_huge NOT_movie NOT_like NOT_lord NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rings .  the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles .  but within that basic outline ,  the story is lively and imaginative .  it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun ,  and a charming little romance .  and it succeeds wonderfully .  there were a lot of big films this summer ,  but none of them were nearly as fun as this one .  there's a lot going on ,  but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent .  it isn't NOT_a NOT_masterpiece ,  but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has (though i don't NOT_like NOT_it NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_the NOT_earlier NOT_film) .  a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre . 
1260 0 this movie could be used in film classes in a "how not NOT_to NOT_script NOT_a NOT_b-movie" NOT_course .  there are inherent constrictions in a b-movie: budgets are tight ,  time is precious (scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced .  the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you .  scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze .  i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie ,  but i'll just mention one: the gravedigger .  the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie .  he seemingly has no NOT_connection NOT_to NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_characters NOT_already NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie .  he is shown with his daughter ,  who also has no NOT_connection NOT_to NOT_anybody NOT_else NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie .  the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count .  why give the gravedigger a daughter? why give the daughter a boyfriend? why introduce them so late in the movie? why not NOT_try NOT_to NOT_make NOT_them NOT_part NOT_of NOT_the NOT_ongoing NOT_storyline? NOT_scarecrow NOT_doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_care . <br /><br />the "story" of scarecrow goes something like this: lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who'd i'd peg to be in his early 30's) who is picked on by the other kids .  he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy .  his mom is a lush and the town whore .  one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings (by calling him a "faggot" for drawing birds instead of "monsters and cowboys . " if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys i'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows) and later ,  kills lester ,  in a cornfield ,  under the titular scarecrow .  magically ,  lester's soul goes into the scarecrow .  somehow ,  this transference changes lester's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast (i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung-fu scarecrow .  i disagree .  the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie) .  the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him ,  those who smoke pot in the corn field ,  those who dig graves ,  boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers ,  pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set . <br /><br />the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned .  the director (a frenchman) does an impromptu version of rap music ,  admits he enjoys not NOT_having NOT_executives NOT_around NOT_on NOT_set NOT_so NOT_he NOT_can NOT_screw NOT_his NOT_wife NOT_while NOT_working NOT_and NOT_gives NOT_a NOT_quote NOT_to NOT_live NOT_by NOT_(and NOT_i'm NOT_paraphrasing): NOT_"life NOT_ez NOT_a NOT_bitch ,  but et has a great ass"<br /><br />number of beers i drank while watching this movie: 5 did it help: no NOT_number NOT_of NOT_beers NOT_needed NOT_to NOT_enjoy NOT_this NOT_movie: NOT_whatever NOT_it NOT_takes NOT_to NOT_get NOT_to NOT_blackout NOT_drunk NOT_level . 
1261 1 i was not NOT_expecting NOT_much NOT_from NOT_this NOT_movie .  i was given a ticket for an advanced screening .  i had just gotten off of work .  it was hot and i was tired .  i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_any NOT_cool NOT_air NOT_flowing NOT_through NOT_the NOT_hallways NOT_of NOT_the NOT_theater NOT_complex . <br /><br />once seated in the theater ,  tired and frustrated ,  the movie started ,  i did not NOT_recognize NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_actors NOT_in NOT_the NOT_beginning ,  but the flow of the movie was perfect .  right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie ,  getting more and more excited with each minute passing .  i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic .  the actors were fabulous ,  the pace was perfect ,  and the ending was magical . 
1262 0 amazing .  that's what you'd say if you sat through this film .  simply ,  incredibly ,  amazing .  it's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't NOT_believe NOT_what NOT_you're NOT_seeing .  that ,  my friends ,  is what is truly scary about this film .  somebody thought it was a good idea to make it .  <br /><br />well ,  here's another amazingly original story: high school student (occasionally seemed like collegeâ—go figure) has whore for a mom ,  lives in a trailer park ,  and is an "artist" who is ridiculed for his "being all different . " well ,  of course ,  this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and ,  here's the original part ,  his soul inhabits a scarecrow (beneath which ,  he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john) .  then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him .  awww . <br /><br />here's the breakdown:<br /><br />the good:<br /><br />--amazingly funny movieâ—even if that's not NOT_what NOT_the NOT_clearly NOT_drunk NOT_filmmakers NOT_wanted . <br /><br />--this and the sequel on one disk in the wal-mart $5 . 00 binâ—so it's only a little overpriced . <br /><br />didn't hurt it ,  didn't NOT_help:<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>--the NOT_violence NOT_and NOT_gore NOT_are NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_sub-standard .  one person is stabbed with a corncob . <br /><br />--sounds like they put some effort into the musicâ—but it doesn't NOT_really NOT_fit NOT_the NOT_movieâ—and NOT_isn't NOT_all NOT_that NOT_good . <br /><br />the bad:<br /><br />--terrible ,  terrible acting . <br /><br />--another slasher let-down with sexy womenâ—none of them removing clothing .  when did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??<br /><br />--ridiculous story . <br /><br />--the scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make freddy krueger and arnold swartzenegger blush . <br /><br />--standard underlying love story goes nowhere ,  and is poorly done . <br /><br />--some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomâ—you never NOT_really NOT_know NOT_who NOT_anybody NOT_is NOT_and NOT_then NOT_they're NOT_killed .  and you only assume that they must've had it coming . <br /><br />the ugly:<br /><br />--extremely average slasher fare ,  just with a murdering scarecrow instead ofâ… well ,  all that other crap . <br /><br />--nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger ,  jason voorhees ,  pinhead ,  chucky ,  or even angela from the "sleepaway camp" seriesâ—all of which are better than this atrocity . <br /><br />--the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life .  the script is laden with a level of retardedness that i never NOT_imagined NOT_could NOT_exist .  i'm serious hereâ—it's a full step beyond terrible .  don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong ,  though ,  it's funny as hellâ—but i've never NOT_heard NOT_more NOT_asinine NOT_banterâ—even NOT_in NOT_"slumber NOT_party NOT_massacre NOT_iii .

1263 1 this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have ,  romance ,  clever witticisms ,  great acting and a fair dose of magic .  <br /><br />i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read) and colorful characters . <br /><br />one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is .  unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale ,  satisfying in and of itself with no NOT_need NOT_for NOT_a NOT_sequel . <br /><br />original .  fun .  feel-good fantasy . 
1264 0 well ,  what was fun .  .  .  except for the fun part . <br /><br />it's my second least favorite so far ,  i even thought it was worse than 'lazarus' and 'ghost in the machine' . <br /><br />let's start with the good .  the teaser ,  it was incredibly well done and also emotional .  being the great animal lover that i am ,  it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode . <br /><br />but then there's all the bad ,  and believe me there is a lot of it .  little made sense ,  so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful .  there were about one or two quotable lines .  <br /><br />and worst of all ,  having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me .  in the end .  .  .  what's the point? they all pretty much died .  we didn't NOT_learn NOT_anything ,  we weren't NOT_entertained ,  and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad .  .  .  just very frustrating . <br /><br />* star .  shame because season 2 was doing so well . 
1265 1 ok here is how i do this .  i grade movies on 10 components .  each component will inherently start with 5 points .  it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0 . <br /><br />mood: action ,  romance ,  comedy ,  drama ,  suspense - i give this component 10 points .  it had a perfect balance of all five aspects .  the action was fun and exiting .  the romance was not NOT_overdone ,  but still very emotional and moving .  i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama ,  and riveting suspense . <br /><br />plot - i give this component 10 points .  i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told .  i found my self ,  sitting in the theatre ,  returned to my childhood ,  and in that instant i again believed in unicorns ,  wicked witches ,  and falling stars that make dreams come true . <br /><br />cinema photography - i give this component 8 points .  while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles ,  i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera . <br /><br />fx - i give this component 10 points .  i love that they used c . g . i .  sparingly .  the epic scenes were believable .  the magical powers were frighteningly realistic .  all in all less is more ,  and this had it all! cast - i give this component 10 points .  no NOT_names NOT_and NOT_seasoned NOT_actors NOT_alike ,  the cast was amazing! michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked ,  charlie cox made tristan come to life ,  claire danes gave emotion to the stars ,  and i will never NOT_look NOT_and NOT_robert NOT_de NOT_niro NOT_the NOT_same NOT_again . <br /><br />acting - i give this component 10 points .  even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection .  once again ,  i will never NOT_look NOT_and NOT_robert NOT_de NOT_niro NOT_the NOT_same NOT_again . <br /><br />character development - i give this component 9 points .  this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice . <br /><br />dialogue - i give this component 10 points .  the dialogue was smart ,  witty ,  funâ… even the mush had good dialogue . <br /><br />score - i give this component 7 points .  i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie .  i am not NOT_complaining NOT_beyond NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_the NOT_music NOT_could NOT_be NOT_more NOT_memorable . <br /><br />ending - i give this component 9 points .  almost perfect ending! i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced ,  while others could have been more subdued ,  but no NOT_threads NOT_were NOT_left NOT_untied . <br /><br />total: 93% buy the dvd? hel yes! see it in the theatre? most definitely! bottom line: excellent movie for everyone! epic! i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre ,  i know i'll be going back for seconds! 
1266 0 the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china .  the movie is based on the novel by pearl s .  buck .  the story is great ,  but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles .  walter connolly is laughable as the farmer's father .  he has such a heavy american accent ,  as do most of the lead actors ,  that i could not NOT_bear NOT_listening NOT_to NOT_him NOT_speak . <br /><br />it is a shame that hollywood could not NOT_get NOT_past NOT_their NOT_racist NOT_beliefs NOT_to NOT_cast NOT_asians NOT_in NOT_the NOT_lead NOT_roles .  to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african-americans . 
1267 1 stardust another guarded review (originally written june 15 ,  2007)<br /><br />the marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?) ,  so i doubt most of you have heard about it .  in truth ,  i hadn't either (sort of) .  when i got the posting ,  i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers ,  one of the movies i want to see when not NOT_working NOT_so NOT_i NOT_an NOT_enjoy NOT_it NOT_100% NOT_as NOT_a NOT_mere NOT_mortal NOT_movie-goer .  turns out ,  it wasn't NOT_transformers NOT_and NOT_i NOT_had NOT_been NOT_aware NOT_of NOT_it NOT_way NOT_back NOT_when NOT_as NOT_'that NOT_neil NOT_gaiman NOT_movie' .  what is it about? well ,  in short ,  it's a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star .  any more than that and i'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract ,  and (b) spoiling your fun .  if you really want to know what it's about ,  go buy the book .  rumour has it ,  gaiman might be something of a writer . <br /><br />not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile .  and for this one ,  it certainly was .  this screening was 'special' in that it included not NOT_just NOT_film NOT_critics ,  but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks .  so ,  you know the expected audience ,  right? i mean ,  with this crowd and the title of stardust ,  i knew what to expect . <br /><br />oh how sweetly wrong i was . <br /><br />yes ,  it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom .  but it was not NOT_lord NOT_of NOT_rings .  it was not NOT_even NOT_another NOT_lord NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rings NOT_wannabe NOT_(ahem ,  eragon) .  it was much more intimate than all that . <br /><br />but ,  like lord of the rings ,  it was the ,  well ,  humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities .  it's surely a romantic tale ,  but with generous splashes of humour .  and that humour is of the sort which is not NOT_slapstick NOT_shrekism .  it's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy .  before i go on ,  let's do this movie review thing . <br /><br />acting is ,  in the very least ,  good .  it's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles .  michelle pfieffer is not ,  sadly ,  one of those .  she plays a villain ,  and she does the job .  nothing special .  rupert everett ,  though ,  he was a real jerk .  that is ,  a great villain .  peter o'toole is ,  well ,  peter frickin' o'toole -- which is marvelous .  ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why .  robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part .  when he wanted to deliver the goods ,  though ,  he did .  and charlie cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain't NOT_never NOT_heard NOT_of . <br /><br />claire danes .  claire danes .  claire danes .  i've always been of mixed opinion with her .  she can be great ,  and then she can seem to miss the mark .  in this ,  she's the former .  and she is ,  quite literally ,  the star of this film .  sure ,  her accent stumbles here and there .  and ,  yes ,  she's not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_she NOT_can NOT_be NOT_when NOT_cox NOT_isn't NOT_in NOT_the NOT_scene .  however  .  .  .  well ,  see for yourself . <br /><br />special effects are muted yet accomplished ,  and only significant where they should be .  best flying ship yet -- sorry potter .  direction is light-hearted and flows nicely .  cinematography could have been better but not NOT_everyone NOT_films NOT_in NOT_new NOT_zealand .  all else is top bracket . <br /><br />and now that that's done .  .  . <br /><br /> .  .  . the writing .  oh ,  the writing! neil ,  you devil .  it's hard in today's climate to do anything original and ,  at first ,  you begin to wonder .  a kingdom ,  a dying king ,  a boy out to prove his own worth ,  witches ,  ghosts ,  a quest (or three) -- what's new? but gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart .  and ,  though you suspect how it's all going to turn out ,  you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best .  in the end ,  you'll find this story ,  this movie ,  is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not .  fantastical and real . <br /><br />(i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won't NOT_ruin NOT_it NOT_for NOT_you .  for those who read the book ,  rest assured ,  it's done properly . )<br /><br />those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did .  a great film for all ages to enjoy ,  and the new {withheld} for this generation .  the blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because ,  well ,  you might be expecting it .  you'll know when you walk out ,  anyway .  i sincerely hope stardust doesn't NOT_get NOT_lost NOT_among NOT_the NOT_tentpoles .  even if it does ,  it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know . <br /><br />---<br /><br />forgot to add the {withheld} reveal .  i'm a few years late ,  but  .  .  .  "a great film for all ages to enjoy ,  and the new the princess bride for this generation . " <br /><br />perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i'm still confident that years form now ,  there will be the same "oh ,  i love that movie , " response to this as there is now for the princess bride . 
1268 0 well i'm probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site ,  but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i've seen in a long time .  we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one .  the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine .  they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind .  conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended .  yeah ok .  with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again .  <br /><br />well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it .  you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film .  however ,  the film then continues on for a whole other hour .  and in this remaining time ,  its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers .  oh yea and the age old ,  money is the root of all evil blah blah blah .  just because you know your making an epic film doesn't NOT_mean NOT_that NOT_your NOT_story NOT_can NOT_go NOT_on NOT_needlessly NOT_for NOT_more NOT_than NOT_it NOT_has NOT_to .  also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together .  then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman ,  and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film .  <br /><br />oh wait and the film isn't NOT_the NOT_only NOT_thing NOT_thats NOT_poorly NOT_written ,  the main characters wife makes absolutely no NOT_sense .  she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_have NOT_a NOT_slave NOT_and NOT_yadda NOT_yadda NOT_yadda .  then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery .  even if they are starving at the time of this idea ,  it still doesn't NOT_make NOT_sense NOT_when NOT_20 NOT_minutes NOT_later NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_she NOT_is NOT_complaining NOT_about NOT_not NOT_wanting NOT_a NOT_slave NOT_again .  <br /><br />there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to .  the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography .  the land is shot beautifully ,  oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive .  too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say .  <br /><br />one last thing .  i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything .  for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability ,  but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no NOT_reason NOT_he NOT_loses NOT_it NOT_and NOT_just NOT_becomes NOT_regular NOT_old NOT_italian NOT_paul ,  they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface(also a better film than this) .  of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian ,  the rest are just americans being silly .  oh and please ms .  rainer that was a really nice one note performance ,  not ,  if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands ,  oh i would .  <br /><br />the good earth is one epic waste of time .  if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath ,  a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets .  mainly because it wasn't NOT_written NOT_by NOT_a NOT_monkey . 
1269 1 i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film . <br /><br />stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her .  the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall ,  a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormhold . <br /><br />this film was just a joy to watch ,  it has something in it for everyone ,  all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny .  if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride ,  a classic . <br /><br />all the performances are outstanding ,  the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia .  .  . but the performance to talk about is robert de niro .  .  . in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show .  .  . <br /><br />if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film .  guys don't NOT_get NOT_turned NOT_off NOT_by NOT_the NOT_description NOT_there NOT_is NOT_enough NOT_action NOT_comedy NOT_and NOT_not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_lots NOT_of NOT_eye NOT_candy NOT_with NOT_claire NOT_danes NOT_and NOT_michelle NOT_pfeiffer NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_you NOT_entertained NOT_throughout .  the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film .  .  . nothing about the film seems forced . 
1270 0 luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth .  unfortunately ,  her role required no .  she did not NOT_say NOT_much NOT_and NOT_looked NOT_pale NOT_throughout NOT_the NOT_film .  luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance) .  set in ancient asia ,  both actors were not NOT_asian ,  but were very convincing in their roles .  i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance ,  because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for .  she must have been a breakthrough actress ,  one of the first to method act .  this seems like something that hollywood does often .  al pacino has played an italian and cuban .  i felt luise's performance to be lackluster throughout ,  and when she died ,  she did not NOT_change NOT_in NOT_expression NOT_from NOT_any NOT_previous NOT_scenes .  she stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice .  if her brilliant acting was so subtle ,  i suppose i did not NOT_see NOT_it . 
1271 1 i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th ,  knowing no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_the NOT_names NOT_of NOT_a NOT_few NOT_of NOT_the NOT_actors NOT_and NOT_that NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_fantasy/adventure NOT_quest NOT_of NOT_some NOT_sort . <br /><br />the plot line really is nothing like i have seen ,  and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters .  in spite of what first impressions may give ,  it isn't NOT_cheesy ,  corny ,  tacky ,  or ridiculous ,  and is actually highly entertaining and funny .  the flow is quite well done ,  nothing seems rushed or dragged out .  the soundtrack ,  for lack of better words ,  is magical and adds much to the film ,  as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv .  and even though i might have known what was coming at points ,  i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge ,  not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_person NOT_left NOT_the NOT_theater NOT_during NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_movie . <br /><br />my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no NOT_marketing NOT_for NOT_this NOT_film ,  and as brilliant as it is i can't NOT_figure NOT_out NOT_why . 
1272 0 a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china .  wang lung (paul muni) buys o-lan ,  his future wife ,  who becomes his slave (luis rainer) .  american stars appear in the leading roles ,  talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology .  a good wife ,  many children and land are the best things for men to have .  they are seen as property and investment .  because it is a big budget movie ,  in which many extras cooperate ,  big sets are built and special effects take place ,  the movie makers could not NOT_take NOT_the NOT_risk NOT_of NOT_hiring NOT_less NOT_popular NOT_actors .  luise rainer won an academy award for this performance ,  which is definitely the worst in the movie .  her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience .  o-lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with .  on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance ,  showing his talent ones again .  another problem with the movie is the ending .  it seems like franklin did not NOT_know NOT_when NOT_to NOT_end NOT_the NOT_picture .  this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions . 
1273 1 why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! everyone should know what an excellent movie this is .  it is engaging and funny from moment one ,  original ,  and well-acted .  i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!<br /><br />for anyone that loved the princess bride ,  labyrinth ,  and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure ,  this is one of the great ones .  robert deniro is hysterical .  relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man .  claire danes is fantastic as always .  michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen .  there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters .  .  . even down to facial expressions . 
1274 0 the good earth is not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_film NOT_by NOT_any NOT_means ,  it is way to ordinary .  maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer .  it is not NOT_very NOT_interesting NOT_to NOT_me .  yes ,  luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long .  i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act .  in short wang lung (muni) a small time farmer who does not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_be NOT_like NOT_his NOT_own NOT_father NOT_turns NOT_out NOT_exactly NOT_like NOT_him .  both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds .  the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next .  also this film did not NOT_have NOT_any NOT_good NOT_character NOT_actors NOT_or NOT_funny NOT_moments ,  it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis . 
1275 1 okay ,  this show is nothing but awesome! it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses .  jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role! he is gunna be big in hollywood .  he has a bright future ahead! this show better last a long time because i really love this show ,  and i hope that it has a lot of success! it is so interesting .  i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here ,  and it's great! i tape it ,  too .  i can watch it whenever i want now! too bad its only on once a week though .  i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day! hope you all like this show!<br /><br />~ashley~ 
1276 0 the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i've seen in my life .  the plot is slow and lacking .  the acting is borderline comical .  while i love paul muni ,  i can now say i have seen a film that does not NOT_do NOT_his NOT_true NOT_ability NOT_justice .  the only saving grace i found with this film is it's production value .  the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment .  also ,  the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time .  other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film . 
1277 1 to anyone who might think this show isn't NOT_for NOT_them ,  please give it a try .  network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people .  this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons ,  learning what real friends and family are about ,  and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime .  jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today ,  and he is perfectly cast as the young ,  slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires (great name!) .  dean cain ,  christopher lloyd ,  mare winningham ,  and kirsten storms round out the main cast ,  and they are all exceptional .  this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen .  hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young (sumpter's character) learn and grow . 
1278 0 the clichã© of the shell-shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment .  pity a splendid cast ,  acting to the limits of their high talents ,  can't NOT_redeem NOT_'the NOT_return NOT_of NOT_the NOT_soldier' NOT_from NOT_its NOT_stiff-collared NOT_inability NOT_to NOT_move NOT_the NOT_viewer NOT_to NOT_emotional NOT_involvement .  best moments ,  as another reviewer noted ,  come when glenda jackson is on screen; but even jackson's crackling good cinematic power can't NOT_pull NOT_this NOT_film's NOT_chestnuts NOT_from NOT_its NOT_cold ,  never NOT_warmed NOT_hearth .  ann-margret ,  she of sex-kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability ,  finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh-flawless middlesex accent .  the hackneyed score ,  redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries' slathered-on saccharine emotionalism ,  is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script ,  blocking ,  and overbaked formalism of the direction; except for its score and corseted script and direction ,  'the return of the soldier' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together . 
1279 1 this is a good family show with a great cast of actors .  it's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late .  there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either ,  unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too .  anyway ,  clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character (pete young) a kind of likability and naivetã© that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly .  dean cain ,  christopher lloyd ,  mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members ,  and each is terrific in their role .  i really like kirsten storms as pete's sister betsy; she is quite a pill ,  but she still cares about her mom and brother ,  even though she hates to show it .  it may take a few episodes to really find it's legs ,  but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while ,  so check it out people--you'll be glad you did! 
1280 0 chilly ,  alienating adaptation of rebecca west's book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired (now there's an original idea!) .  it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not NOT_current NOT_wife NOT_julie NOT_christie ,  which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks .  this extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co-stars jackson ,  christie ,  ann-margret ,  and ian holm ,  but the burners are all on low .  there are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever jackson is on-screen) ,  but bridges' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film's dulled-out color is enervating .  long on the shelf ,  this "soldier" is best left forgotten .  *1/2 from **** 
1281 1 me and my sister saw the premiere last night .  .  .  it was so good we were glued for the whole thing .  .  hahaha .  . i think i'm hooked for the season!! .  .  .  .  they have some really good actors in this thing .  .  the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don't NOT_really NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_they'll NOT_keep NOT_it NOT_stretched NOT_for NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_season .  .  there will probably be some big twist tho .  . i cant wait till tuesday .  .  finally jeremy sumpter who is he? i can tell hes going to be big!! he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away .  .  cant wait for the next episode .  .  go jeremy!<br /><br />'aimee 
1282 0 in my knowledge ,  largo winch was a famous belgium comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy ,  a sort of james bond without the spy life! so ,  when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid ,  i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond!<br /><br />but ,  just after the opening credits ,  i got heavy doubts: when american movies offer amazing start ,  here ,  no NOT_action NOT_and NOT_a NOT_torrid NOT_sex NOT_scene NOT_â… NOT_then ,  the story get very complicated with financial movesâ… i thought i lost the kid . <br /><br />but ,  strangely ,  he had been caught by largo ,  and more than james bond! <br /><br />was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley? the difficult relationship largo has with his father? the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys ,  the bad guys are the friends? the exotic locations of honk-kong ,  yougoslavia? <br /><br />dunno ,  but he really cares about largo ("will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment . 
1283 1 this show has a few clichã©s and a few over the top ,  dawson's creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talking about way back when life made sense?) ,  but overall it seems like a decent show .  most of the characters seem very real ,  and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end .  i just hope every episode doesn't NOT_turn NOT_out NOT_to NOT_be NOT_life-altering NOT_like NOT_the NOT_first ,  that would just be too much drama for this vehicle .  jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball ,  i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of . 
1284 0 first of all ,  if you'r a fan of the comic ,  well ,  you'll be very disappointed i'm sure ! low budget movie !!! largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic ,  now suddenly he becomes croatian ,  pfff! chicken producers ,  it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( by the way ,  in the film ,  his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian .  .  .  lol ) .  the striking n . y .  winch building becomes a common average-small yacht in h . k .  the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan/turkish looking guy .  freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes some fat ,  out of shape ,  sad ,  average guy .  simon ,  largo's good buddy ,  does not NOT_exist NOT_at NOT_all NOT_!? NOT_he NOT_gave NOT_some NOT_pepper NOT_! NOT_largo NOT_doesn't NOT_throw NOT_knifes NOT_at NOT_all ,  but just some snake stares .  .  .  the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv-film .  french directors and producers ,  if you don't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_money ,  the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic ,  please stick to some romance shooted in paris .  very very bad film ,  good thing i just rented it ,  don't NOT_count NOT_on NOT_me NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_sequel NOT_( NOT_if NOT_there NOT_is NOT_any NOT_! NOT_) . 
1285 1 i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of mine . <br /><br />for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood ,  hating this film ,  hating myself and even hating the french actress .  and then .  .  . <br /><br />i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_happened NOT_but NOT_i NOT_was NOT_pulled NOT_into NOT_the NOT_film NOT_in NOT_a NOT_way NOT_that NOT_i NOT_hadn't NOT_been NOT_in NOT_years .  and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand .  i was in the theater for close to four hours ,  but it was worth it .  <br /><br />i believe that great movies pull you inside a world ,  make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink .  this film did that .  it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever had . <br /><br /> <br /><br /> 
1286 0 i'm a big fan of the tv series largo winch .  this movie was pain for me .  i had to use fast forward not NOT_to NOT_fell NOT_to NOT_sleep .  it was boring! how can somebody ruin this title so much? the story was the only good thing .  actors were sh . t .  they can't NOT_live NOT_the NOT_role .  the main actor(tom  .  .  .  ) is a null .  watch the other roles of this actor .  the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not NOT_to NOT_followable , somehow they were not NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_the NOT_situation .  like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors . maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title .  french can't NOT_do NOT_right NOT_thing NOT_with NOT_big NOT_films , like alien 4 .  that was bit brrr ,  after alien 1 , 2 , 3 . 
1287 1 since my third or fourth viewing some time ago ,  i've abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd .  in the meantime ,  i've read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon's monograph on jean eustache .  the latter ends with a frustrating filmography ,  eleven films ,  fiction ,  doc ,  and in-between ,  impossible to see or ,  in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le pã¨re noã«l .  .  .  ,  re-see . <br /><br />a few questions that hit me this moment: polish vã©ronika's french is plenty colloquial (un maximum d' "un maximum d'") .  even so ,  does she have an accent? i think i can tell she does .  what does the absence of color add ,  especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed? how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter's tale? ditto alphaville .  we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it ,  but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu? is this an enchanted isle? is alexandre's a fairy tale? alexandre's always choreographing himself ,  worrying about how or where to stand or walk ,  what to say when ,  announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does .  or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself? how different is he from vertigo's scottie? (i say ,  i think ,  very . ) what's the difference ,  and is there one ,  between eustache's lã©aud ,  and truffaut's ,  and godard's? how different is the present lã©aud? isn't NOT_he NOT_still NOT_doing NOT_it ,  whatever it is ,  in recent roles ,  irma vep ,  le pornographe ,  whatever ,  approaching old age? once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel (lã©aud's character) truffaut films .  for a long while ,  every three or five minutes ,  down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf ,  tweedy coat ,  lã©aud hair ,  with a direction-seeking nose .  i have no NOT_idea NOT_whether NOT_this NOT_was NOT_conscious NOT_or NOT_unconscious NOT_mimicry .  i was that age ,  but have no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_i NOT_myself NOT_looked NOT_like NOT_then .  no NOT_scarf ,  at least .  i do have a brother ,  though ,  who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson .

1289 1 a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend .  of course the sob is very good-looking ,  charming ,  etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman .  watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends .  it's tragic ,  and you know she's going to end up very hurt ,  but there's nothing you can do .  leaud is brilliant .  totally empty .  a blank throughout ,  he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants . <br /><br />the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love ,  and the next morning he puts on a record and ,  very sweetly and charmingly ,  sings along to amuse her is brilliant .  the "what the hell am i doing here with this idiot" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come . <br /><br />it's a long film ,  but see it in one go ,  preferably in a cinema .  takes a while to get into ,  but then the time just disappears . 
1290 0 when i first saw the preview for this movie ,  i really couldn't wait to see it .  the plot seemed good and the setting was great .  i mean ,  a slasher movie that takes place on prom night ,  great idea!! and the plot: a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students ,  goes crazy ,  gets arrested ,  and escapes three years later on prom night! prom night ,  a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable ,  turns into hell!! however ,  i saw it and was extremely disappointed .  it was not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_"horror NOT_movie" NOT_i NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_seen ,  but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen!! first of all ,  it wasn't NOT_even NOT_scary .  there was not NOT_one NOT_moment NOT_in NOT_that NOT_movie NOT_when NOT_i NOT_jumped NOT_out NOT_of NOT_my NOT_seat .  also ,  the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull .  all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats .  also there was absolutely no NOT_gore NOT_(its NOT_rated NOT_pg-13) .  the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl .  he slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them (they don't NOT_actually NOT_show NOT_him NOT_cutting NOT_her NOT_throat) . <br /><br />next ,  you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie .  he isn't NOT_mysterious ,  creepy ,  or scary .  he's just this guy who kills people . <br /><br />also ,  everything in the movie was so clichã© .  an example is when ,  at the end ,  the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment ,  the detective shoots and kills him .  also ,  every single thing in this movie was so predictable .  the victim ,  after seeing the guy with a knife ,  runs for her life ,  hides ,  thinks she gets away ,  and then the killer just pops out and kills her . <br /><br />finally ,  the sequence of the movie was extremely bad .  the guy goes into the hotel ,  kills a few people ,  the bodies are discovered ,  someone pulls the fire alarm ,  and everyone evacuates .  the main character forgets something in her room ,  has an encounter with the killer ,  runs and escapes .  thats it! she and her boyfriend go home ,  the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house ,  finds the girl ,  then gets killed by the detective .  the movie sequence was so stupid and clichã© . <br /><br />if your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good ,  trust me ,  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_or NOT_money .  no NOT_wonder NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_being NOT_shown NOT_in NOT_the NOT_smallest NOT_theater NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_theater .  my friend and i ,  along with these two girls sitting in the back ,  were the only ones in the theater .  that should have told me something about the movie beforehand . 
1291 1 i hate over-long over-talky french movies ,  but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all .  i saw it twice in the mid-70's ,  and then it disappeared .  but i finally got to see it again in 1999 ,  and fell in love all over again .  what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago .  if you haven't seen it ,  don't NOT_miss NOT_your NOT_chance! 
1292 0 i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident .  .  . well it must of been .  blonde women being stalked , the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing , hiding . he was'nt even a super hero so i don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_he NOT_did NOT_it . he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_do . <br /><br />the old "mirror in the bathroom"is just not NOT_scary NOT_anymore NOT_in NOT_fact NOT_it NOT_stopped NOT_being NOT_scary NOT_years NOT_ago .  you had the cop on the trail of the villain , another clichã©(played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent , he's from london) the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of clichã©'s and make's "scary move"which was a comedy look scary .  pathetic! 
1293 1 a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend .  of course the sob is very good-looking ,  charming ,  etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman .  watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends .  it's tragic ,  and you know she's going to end up very hurt ,  but there's nothing you can do .  leaud is brilliant .  totally empty .  a blank throughout ,  he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants . <br /><br />the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love ,  and the next morning he puts on a record and ,  very sweetly and charmingly ,  sings along to amuse her is brilliant .  the "what the hell am i doing here with this idiot" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come . <br /><br />it's a long film ,  but see it in one go ,  preferably in a cinema .  takes a while to get into ,  but then the time just disappears . 
1294 0 the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay .  it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes .  the ending was even worse .  everyone kept dying ,  but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok! they did not NOT_give NOT_enough NOT_history NOT_about NOT_the NOT_obsession NOT_the NOT_teacher NOT_had ,  etc .  the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline .  the only reason i give this 3/10 is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors .  they needed better coaching .  they could have really made this an ok film ,  but the screenplay and acting failed miserably . 
1295 1 well ,  of course not ,  women are overly sensitive and needy on average ,  which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore ,  though not NOT_pseudo-artistically ,  extravagantly ,  or blatantly dwelt on .  unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice .  as many good films ,  i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing .  all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd .  i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much ,  but really ,  what do i care why? though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation .  all right ,  so you may disagree ,  perhaps it is a bit boring at times ,  i'm not NOT_an NOT_expert .  the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka . 
1296 0 the night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic .  and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives . <br /><br />there really is no NOT_excuse NOT_for NOT_prom NOT_night .  there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb .  the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts' .  it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them . <br /><br />the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage .  and the thing was ,  it wasn't NOT_even NOT_a NOT_slightly NOT_exciting NOT_rampage .  maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap ,  i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious .  the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't NOT_really NOT_add NOT_to NOT_the NOT_effect ,  either .  and to make matters worse ,  the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious .  the hotel staff didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_notice NOT_or NOT_care NOT_that NOT_one NOT_of NOT_their NOT_maids NOT_had NOT_vanished NOT_and NOT_are NOT_further NOT_proof NOT_that NOT_a NOT_murderer NOT_is NOT_unrecognisable NOT_after NOT_he NOT_has NOT_had NOT_a NOT_shave .  i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy ,  stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was .  she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs ,  entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets .  nice one . <br /><br />the worst thing was ,  i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest .  he really pushed all boundaries by not NOT_showing NOT_any NOT_killing NOT_actually NOT_happening .  shocking! and the music ,  don't NOT_even NOT_get NOT_me NOT_started .  it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral . <br /><br />i really wish that prom night was a joke .  it was terrible and stupidly predictable .  no NOT_one ,  in their right mind or otherwise ,  has any reason to see this film .  mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation .  if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film ,  hear my plea .  don't NOT_do NOT_it .  there are better things to spend six pounds on .  like a sheet to play ghosts with . 
1297 1 i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site .  i would have to say it was worth the effort .  however ,  you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes .  if you don't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_staying NOT_power ,  get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights . <br /><br />now to the film ,  what i say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't NOT_mind ,  here goes: <br /><br />alexandre is a promiscuous bum ,  a womanizer and a gigolo .  he lives with an older woman called marie .  marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex .  alex spends his days at cafã©s and restaurants .  the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with .  gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not NOT_love NOT_because NOT_alex NOT_had NOT_abused NOT_and NOT_battered NOT_her .  at this point ,  alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else .  <br /><br />by chance ,  alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship .  veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past .  marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a mã©nage ã  trois to boot .  finally at the end ,  it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him .  we assume (as aforesaid with gilberte's situation) alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family .  there is hope! <br /><br />with the title of "la maman et la putain" ,  i deduce jean eustache was relating to franã§oise lebrun's character of veronika .  she was a whore and then she became the mother .  hence ,  the mother and whore is the same person? anyway ,  what do i know! french films are mostly (not all) very chatty ,  aimlessly political ,  preaching ,  theatrical ,  insipid ,  lamenting and full of quotes .  lebrun and lã©aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed .  <br /><br />not a bad effort .  7/10 . 
1298 0 ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money!!the producers obviously didn't NOT_care NOT_about NOT_killing NOT_a NOT_classic NOT_horror NOT_movie .  i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg-13 how many pg-13 slashers movies have turned out to be good? thats like asking how many women have been on the moon? the answer is none!! prom night 1980 was of cource no NOT_masterpiece NOT_but NOT_it NOT_certainly NOT_deserves NOT_to NOT_be NOT_recognised NOT_as NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_stays NOT_true NOT_to NOT_its NOT_genre NOT_and NOT_deosnt NOT_try NOT_to NOT_be NOT_anything NOT_more NOT_than NOT_that . <br /><br />my problem with prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . <br /><br />1)the way he escapes ,  he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent!! what the hell? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room? do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2)his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self ,  he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her ,  so does he want to kill her ,  love her or just plain rape her?? 3) the killer is too good ,  how did he develop all of his skills? he used to be a teacher ,  so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn't NOT_notice ,  it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible , silly , stupid attempt at a horror movie 
1299 1 we don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_lose NOT_this NOT_movie ,  this is one of the greatest i have ever seen .  jean pierre leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue .  jean eustache is no NOT_more NOT_on NOT_this NOT_earth ,  we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors .  you just have to love this masterpiece .  i'll never NOT_forget NOT_it . <br /><br />p . s . : sorry for the english .  .  . 
1300 0 why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime (the texas chainsaw massacre ,  the hills have eyes) but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't NOT_brilliant NOT_to NOT_start NOT_with NOT_(prom NOT_night ,  the amityville horror) much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere ,  character or any genuine scares at all .  prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch ,  but for all the wrong reasons . <br /><br />it's a poorly acted ,  massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do .  it's clear hollywood horror is dead .  even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot .  prom night is virtually bloodless and i'm not NOT_even NOT_going NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_how NOT_bad NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_is .  its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm .  .  .  the original . <br /><br />one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be .  donna keppel (brittany snow) has survived a terrible tragedy ,  but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style . <br /><br />when the big night finally arrives ,  donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn .  but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future ,  the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance .  an obsessed killer is on the loose ,  and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna . <br /><br />who will survive to see graduation day ,  and what will donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear? scott porter ,  jessica stroup ,  and dana davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor .  a plot that will probably put you off going to see this .  witch if you ask me is a good thing . <br /><br />without much to work with ,  mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations .  at one point ,  a girl backs into a floor lamp (a lamp!) and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment .  desperate times really do call for desperate measures .  there haven't been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue . <br /><br />in the era of the hills ,  my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator ,  there probably is a freaky ,  scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty .  this is not NOT_that NOT_movie . <br /><br />my final verdict? avoid at all cost .  nobody will like prom night ,  it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes .  considering its absolute lack of blood or frights .  a night you'll be in a hurry to forget . 
1301 1 a great movie ,  rather challenging than really entertaining .  sadly ,  no NOT_memorable NOT_quotes NOT_here ,  but this one's my favorite: alexandre: if you're leaving someone that you have loved ,  you have to say what i'm telling you now: "farewell ,  i'm going . " but to disappear ,  to hide like a criminal ,  is ignoble .  (didn't watch it with english subtitles)<br /><br />in my opinion ,  this expresses it all .  there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others ,  and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth .  however ,  knowing the truth can hurt even more ,  as alexandre experiences .  common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of "liberated love" by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved .  it does ,  indeed ,  show this in a convincing manner ,  but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth: it's not NOT_that NOT_liberated NOT_love NOT_is NOT_in NOT_itself NOT_doomed NOT_to NOT_failure ,  but people (especially men ,  i think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not NOT_through NOT_practicing NOT_liberated NOT_love . <br /><br />that said ,  the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching . 
1302 0 i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts .  i must admit ,  i found it pretty decent .  .  . until i started to think about what the characters were saying .  logical problems:<br /><br />1 .  her boyfriend ,  who seems to be a pretty fit dude ,  makes no NOT_sound NOT_while NOT_being NOT_killed .  don't NOT_you NOT_think NOT_that NOT_he NOT_might NOT_have NOT_at NOT_least NOT_tried NOT_to NOT_take NOT_the NOT_killer? NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>2 .  when the remark is made that the gym teacher is "soooo in love with lisa , " i almost screamed at the screen .  when your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her ,  you don't NOT_make NOT_comments NOT_like NOT_that NOT_if NOT_you NOT_have NOT_half NOT_of NOT_a NOT_heart . <br /><br />3 .  as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead ,  wouldn't NOT_the NOT_smart NOT_thing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_be NOT_to NOT_get NOT_donna ,  boyfriend ,  aunt ,  and uncle into a car and drive far ,  far away ,  then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_get NOT_out?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i NOT_could NOT_go NOT_on .  and on .  and on .  basically ,  the plot was decent ,  the characters weren't NOT_profiled NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_you NOT_to NOT_actually NOT_feel NOT_any NOT_empathy NOT_when NOT_they NOT_were NOT_slaughtered NOT_and NOT_there NOT_were NOT_way NOT_too NOT_many NOT_errors . <br /><br />however . <br /><br />this movie might be good for teenagers ,  or young couples just looking for a fun night out .  if you don't NOT_consider NOT_all NOT_the NOT_goofs ,  it's a mediocre film . 
1303 1 ** possible spoilers **<br /><br />i like this film and have no NOT_problem NOT_staying NOT_awake NOT_for NOT_it .  it reminds me of me at 20 ,  except this is even better .  like veronica says ,  two chicks at one time .  it brings out the horniness in me ,  the casual conversation ,  these two real life chicks ,  rather than hookers ,  teasing us every step of the way .  i get into the conversations too .  even if they are utterly b . s .  at times ,  so what? every chick ,  just about ,  that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b . s .  philosophy .  it's just a bunch of nonsense ,  and about as sensible as that other b . s .  philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts .  the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women ,  he's into the same b . s .  and moodiness .  the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there . <br /><br />i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica .  she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander ,  but veronica plays her all the way .  she's brilliant .  she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them ,  and then she steals the boy-child/man ,  which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group .  the brunette knows she's been had by the end ,  when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that ,  paraphrasing ,  there are a million couples in paris tonight ,  but i only have this refrain . <br /><br />but do they get married in the end ,  alex and veronica? mmmm? i can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup .  they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones . <br /><br />i like the film though .  it kept me entertained ,  it's got a nice look ,  and it's sexy . 
1304 0 i think it was an overrated pg-13 crap! at least brittany snow's performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too ,  but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not NOT_that NOT_convincing .  the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too .  the deaths were stupid ,  boring and completely unoriginals .  the movie was very boring too and very overrated .  it wasn't NOT_suspenseful NOT_at NOT_all ,  i almost fall asleep .  its another bad pg-13 remake ,  its really a dreadful movie imo .  the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring .  the movie is pretty slow too .  overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too ,  but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake .  well thats just my opinion .  i gave it a 2/10 . 
1305 1 this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it .  you have a insecure ,  troubled and fascinating main character (played by jean-pierre lã©aud) who is trapped between two (no ,  three) women .  we listen to his social ,  philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues ,  we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves .  this could be the premise for a fowl movie ,  full of rigid ,  cold ,  uninteresting commentaries .  yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh ,  ironic and witty .  being such a long movie ,  one cannot but burst into laughing when ,  after 2 hours of speaking politely ,  jean-pierre lã©aud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie .  this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary .  nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of franã§oise lebrun towards the end of the movie .  3 and 1/2 hours and worthing every minute . 
1306 0 if i could give this film a real rating ,  it would likely be in the minus numbers .  while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible "horror" films ,  seriously ,  people ,  buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time . <br /><br />despite it being a horror film ,  there is nothing scary about it ,  unless the idea of seeing how many horror clichã©'s you can fit in one movie scares you .  if the rating had been higher ,  it probably would have made for a better film in the long run . <br /><br />whoever made this version of "prom night" ,  you screwed up .  the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_questionable NOT_scripting .  this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip .  i'd sooner go and see "one missed call" again ,  at least that had some plot . 
1307 1 "la maman et la putain" is the beautifulest film of all time .  and what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with ,  which is directly inspired by proust's "a la recherche du temps perdu" . <br /><br />indeed ,  "la maman et la putain" and "in search of lost time" apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love ,  which repeats itself endlessly .  the first woman's name is always gilberte ,  and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte : veronika is like a "whore gilberte" ,  beautiful like the night ,  whereas gilberte was pure ,  and "beautiful like the day" .  after the failure of the first love ,  a second love begins ,  but this one is like already doomed by the first one .  veronika takes the place of gilberte ,  in alexandre's life and in the movie .  she progressively eclipses her ,  first by time to time ,  gilberte's still coming when alexandre waits for veronika , then totally .  that shows it's the same sad story repeating itself ,  the same "unfaithful woman" ,  like alexandre says ,  who appears endlessly - and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love ,  which makes it exist ,  but which also underlines its illusions . <br /><br />art is what causes the passage between what's outside - the illusion of love - to what's inside ,  which is the truth ,  and is a learning of this truth .  for instance ,  when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed ,  he answers that he saw it in a movie ,  and then ,  that a movie ,  "it's made for that ,  to learn how to live ,  how to make a bed" .  alexander wants to live like he was in a film ,  he wants his life to be art .  <br /><br />this conception of art comes from proust ,  with whom eustache shares the same rejection of "political art" and realism in art .  "la maman et la putain" fights against a conception of art "principaly political" - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre .  like proust says : "art doesn't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_all NOT_this NOT_proclamations ,  and only exists in silence . " first of all ,  art is introspection .  and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist .  proust writes : "i discover the illusion of realism ,  which is a lie" .  that's why "la maman et la putain" doesn't NOT_hide NOT_its NOT_artificiality ,  underlines by the way the actors "say" their text : "the more you seem artificial ,  the higher you go" ,  said eustache . <br /><br />eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a "translater" of a inner truth .  but ,  alexandre failed where eustache succeed .  "la maman et la putain" tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is .  you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie ,  which becomes saddest .  you can see it in the face of alexandre ,  who looks more and more like a living-dead .  you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer ,  and that after a while ,  nothing happens outside .  at the end of the movie ,  when you see alexandre writing ,  and veronika asking if he's writing his life , you can guess that he's not ,  that even literature failed .  the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander ,  who is smashes by the heaviness of reality .  and in this tiny nurse's room ,  alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel . <br /><br />to explain this failure ,  we can say that alexandre is a balzac's reader .  in "forme et signification" ,  jean rousset explains that ,  in proust's ,  the readers of balzac ,  who are swann and charlus ,  are unable of any artistic creation ,  because they're stuck in reality ,  which they mistake with art .  they see reality in art and "are not NOT_aware NOT_of NOT_the NOT_transformations NOT_that NOT_necessarily NOT_exist NOT_between NOT_the NOT_life NOT_of NOT_an NOT_artist NOT_and NOT_his NOT_work ,  between reality and art" .  and that's exactly alexandre .  he claims for instance that he "loves a woman for parallel reasons ,  because she played in a bresson's for example" .  he's like swann ,  who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli's woman . <br /><br />"life is perhaps not NOT_my NOT_vocation" .  this thought is indeed by eustache ,  who committed suicide ,  even if it's said by alexandre .  nevertheless ,  there is a difference between alexandre and eustache : if eustache is absolutely alexandre ,  alexandre is like a double without art ,  a horrible vision of the artist ,  which crystallizes his fears . <br /><br />by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie ,  alexandre is condemned to illusions .  it's death that remind me the last frames of the movie ,  in the face of jean-pierre lã©aud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika .  or maybe it is already hell that describes the end ,  like in sarte's "huit-clot" ,  and absolutely not NOT_like NOT_in NOT_the NOT_final NOT_liberation NOT_of NOT_"le NOT_temps NOT_retrouvã©" .  if eustache had read proust ,  alexandre could never NOT_have NOT_finish NOT_the NOT_book NOT_ ,  always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafã©s .  "la maman et la putain" is like a inverse double of "in search of lost times" ,  which tells how alexander doesn't NOT_become NOT_an NOT_artist ,  whereas "a la recherche du temps perdu" tells how marcel becomes a writer (genette) . <br /><br />if ,  like baudelaire says ,  an artiste tells "reality at the light of his dream" ,  it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in "la maman et la putain" . 
1308 0 "prom night" is a title-only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen .  this movie takes place in an oregon town ,  where donna (brittany snow) is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years .  she and her friends arrive at the prom ,  which is taking place in a grand hotel ,  and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives .  little does anyone know ,  a man from donna's past ,  who has haunted her for years ,  is also at the prom .  .  .  and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her . <br /><br />i'm a fan of the original "prom night" ,  so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie ,  but i have to admit i was quite disappointed .  "prom night" suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have ,  and that is predictability .  there are absolutely no NOT_surprises NOT_here ,  and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times ,  often better ,  before .  what does this equate to for the audience? boredom .  unless of course you have never NOT_seen NOT_any NOT_horror NOT_movies ,  or are part of the pre-teen crowd ,  but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen .  the plot is simplistic ,  but the entire script is void of any type of surprise ,  twist ,  atmosphere ,  or anything ,  and this really ,  really hurts the movie because it never NOT_really NOT_gives NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_sink NOT_their NOT_teeth NOT_into .  it all just seemed very bland . <br /><br />a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg-13 slasher movie as well ,  and i understand what they are saying ,  but i don't NOT_think NOT_it's NOT_impossible NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_good NOT_slasher NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_minimal NOT_gore .  take carpenter's "halloween" for example - little to no NOT_on NOT_screen NOT_violence ,  but still an extremely frightening and effective movie .  you don't NOT_need NOT_gore NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_film NOT_scary ,  but even had "prom night" been gratuitously violent (which it is not ,  it is very tame) ,  it still would have added little to the movie because there is not NOT_much NOT_in NOT_the NOT_script NOT_to NOT_build NOT_on NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with .  the tension and suspense here is mild at best ,  and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations ,  and was correct about 99% of the time .  our characters aren't NOT_well NOT_written NOT_enough NOT_either NOT_for NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_to NOT_make NOT_any NOT_connection NOT_to NOT_them ,  and their by-the-numbers demises are routine and careless . <br /><br />i will point out a few things i did like about this movie ,  though ,  because it wasn't NOT_completely NOT_useless NOT_- NOT_the NOT_cinematography NOT_is NOT_really NOT_nice ,  and everything was very well-filmed and fairly stylish .  among the "jump" scares (that are for the most part very predictable) ,  there were a few that were kind of clever .  the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold ,  however predictable the unfolding may be .  as for the acting ,  it's mediocre at best .  brittany snow plays the lead decently ,  but really the rest of the cast doesn't NOT_show NOT_off NOT_much NOT_talent .  johnathan schaech plays the villain ,  and is probably the most experienced performer here ,  but even he isn't NOT_that NOT_impressive .  however ,  i did like the character he played ,  which was a nice change from the typical 'masked-stalker' type killer we see a lot .  as far as the ending goes ,  the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit's end and it was very anti-climactic . <br /><br />overall ,  "prom night" was a disappointment .  everything was very by-the-numbers ,  routine ,  and predictable ,  which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie .  there were a few neat moments ,  but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere ,  and had little plot development ,  nor believable characters .  i'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video ,  or rent the original instead ,  because there are absolutely no NOT_surprises NOT_here .  some may find a little entertainment in it ,  but it was far too predictable for my tastes .  i expected better ,  and left the theater very disappointed .  3/10 . 
1309 1 in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual "revolution" (purposefully i use quotations for that word) ,  jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic ,  damning critique of those who can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_get NOT_enough NOT_love .  if there is a message to this film- and i'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben-hur length feature has to offer- it's that in order to love ,  honestly ,  there has to be some level of happiness ,  of real truth .  is it possible to have two lovers? some can try ,  but what is the outcome if no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_really NOT_have NOT_what NOT_they NOT_really NOT_want ,  or feel they can even express to say what they want? <br /><br />what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre (jean-pierre leaud) has with the women around him? he's a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual ,  not NOT_with NOT_any NOT_seeming NOT_job NOT_and NOT_he NOT_lives NOT_off NOT_of NOT_a NOT_woman ,  marie (bernadette lafont) slightly older than him and is usually ,  if not NOT_always ,  his lover ,  his last possible love-of-his-life left him ,  and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street ,  veronika (franã§oise lebrun) ,  who perhaps reminds him of her .  soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film ,  where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures .  at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre ,  but we're mistaken .  the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around ,  talking on and on ,  for something to sink in . <br /><br />we're told that part of the sexual revolution ,  in theory if not NOT_entirely NOT_in NOT_practice NOT_(perhaps NOT_it NOT_was ,  i can't NOT_say NOT_having NOT_not NOT_been NOT_alive NOT_in NOT_the NOT_period NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it NOT_first-hand) ,  was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions .  but eustache's point ,  if not NOT_entirely NOT_message ,  is that it's practically impossible to have it both ways: you can't NOT_have NOT_people NOT_love NOT_you NOT_and NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_get NOT_the NOT_satisfaction NOT_of NOT_ultimate NOT_companionship NOT_that NOT_arrives NOT_with NOT_"f***ing" ,  as the characters refer over and over again .  <br /><br />the mother and the whore's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity ,  the lack of monogamy ,  while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you've ever seen in a movie .  at the same time we see a character like alexandre ,  who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past ,  eustache makes it so that the film itself isn't NOT_pretentious- NOT_though NOT_it NOT_could NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_be- NOT_but NOT_that NOT_it's NOT_about NOT_pretentiousness ,  what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws ,  what they need to use when they're ultimately alone in the morning .  <br /><br />if you thought films like before sunrise/sunset were talky relationship flicks ,  you haven't met this .  but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have ,  sometimes trivial ,  or 'deep' ,  or sexual ,  or frank ,  or occasionally extremely (or in a subdued manner) emotional ,  it's never ,  ever uninteresting or boring .  on the contrary ,  for those who can't NOT_get NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_a NOT_*good* NOT_talky NOT_film ,  it's exceptional .  while his style doesn't NOT_call NOT_out NOT_to NOT_the NOT_audaciousness NOT_that NOT_came NOT_with NOT_his NOT_forerunners NOT_in NOT_the NOT_nouvelle NOT_vague NOT_a NOT_dozen NOT_years NOT_beforehand ,  eustache's new-wave touch is with the characters ,  and then reverberating on them . <br /><br />this is realism with a spike of attitude ,  with things at time scathing and sarcastic ,  crude and without shame in expression .  all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can't NOT_ever NOT_perceive NOT_them NOT_as NOT_'faking' NOT_an NOT_emotion NOT_or NOT_going NOT_at NOT_all NOT_into NOT_melodrama .  it's almost too good in naturalistic/realism terms ,  but for eustache's material there is no NOT_other NOT_way NOT_around NOT_it .  luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period ,  and both ladies ,  particularly labrun as the "whore" veronika (a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film's climax of sorts in one unbroken shot) .  and ,  as another touch ,  every so often ,  the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought ,  of a character sitting by themselves ,  listening to a record ,  and in contemplation or quiet agony .  this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch ,  who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely (and lovingly) in approach from the late parisian . <br /><br />sad to say ,  before i saw broken flowers ,  i never NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_eustache NOT_or NOT_this NOT_film ,  and procuring it has become quite a challenge (not available on us dvd ,  and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries) .  not NOT_a NOT_minute NOT_of NOT_that NOT_time NOT_was NOT_wasted; NOT_the NOT_mother NOT_and NOT_the NOT_whore NOT_is NOT_truly NOT_beautiful NOT_work ,  one of the best of french relationship dramas ,  maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i've seen from the country in general .  it's complex ,  it's sweet ,  it's cold ,  it's absorbing ,  and it's very long ,  perhaps too long .  it's also satisfying on the kind of level that i'd compare to scenes from a marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film's release . 
1310 0 i went into this with my hopes up ,  by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn't have been more let down .  despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake ,  i kept my hopes high that maybe .  .  . just maybe someone would get it right this time around .  sadly ,  prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake ,  bad script ,  bad direction ,  cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror . <br /><br />from beginning to end it's boring ,  repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls .  we've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this .  if you go to see prom night in the theater (i'd say wait for the dvd or ppv) ,  get ready for the audience to laugh ,  because laugh they will .  the laughs aren't NOT_at NOT_points NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_are NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_funny ,  they are in response to key "thrilling" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie .  seriously ,  was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? the film makers missed the mark so badly here ,  that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie .  which in retrospect ,  i wish i had done .  not NOT_me NOT_though ,  i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better .  needless to say it didn't .  the "horror" scenes are a joke ,  not NOT_even NOT_so NOT_much NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_acting NOT_but NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_direction ,  the script ,  the "special effects" and the camera work .  the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it ,  but still came out of it with a micro budget movie .  i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere .  <br /><br />this movies scary alright ,  if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed . 
1311 1 unfortunately ,  jean eustache (1938-1981) belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not NOT_released NOT_on NOT_international NOT_dvds .  since we have a good old-fashioned video-store in tucson ,  i had the chance to watch this 3 1/2-hour marathon masterwork that is not NOT_boring NOT_for NOT_ten NOT_seconds . <br /><br />since we speak here about one of the most discussed (and most controversially discussed) movies of all times ,  let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs ,  originally typical for the early "nouvelle vague" of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie .  the dialogs are basically monologues ,  mainly the longest ones spoken by jean-pierre lã©aud .  the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero .  lã©aud ,  or his character ,  alexandre ,  pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak .  therefore ,  one can hardly speak about communication in this movie .  it is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas ,  but the type of man alexandre exists to all times ,  we find him already in petron's "satiricon" ,  which work has actually great resemblance with "the mother and the whore" . <br /><br />alexandre does not NOT_only NOT_nothing ,  but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting ,  at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is .  he mocks at the people who run to work at 7 c'clock in the morning ,  when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives .  he is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between nietzsche and bernanos .  especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual cafã© "aux deux magots" ,  where alexandre ,  too ,  is sitting all day ,  must serve as excuse for the life-style of alexandre and his colleagues ,  because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea .  however ,  the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual ,  and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books . <br /><br />it is true: this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge ,  especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement ,  but if you have this knowledge ,  than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not NOT_done NOT_it NOT_since NOT_a NOT_long NOT_time . 
1312 0 note: i couldn't force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night .  it just can't NOT_be NOT_done .  instead ,  i went through what i thought about while watching the movie . <br /><br />things that i thought about while watching prom night: <br /><br />-i'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place ,  only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it .  of course ,  when i say "elaborate deaths" ,  i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach .  didn't NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_"it's NOT_just NOT_a NOT_dream" NOT_thing NOT_get NOT_ruined NOT_by NOT_dallas? NOT_speaking NOT_of NOT_which ,  i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death . <br /><br />-the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichã©s on two hands .  not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_sign . <br /><br />-even after just meeting the protagonist's boyfriend ,  i'm convinced he will die .  anybody want to place bets? <br /><br />-the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character ,  donna .  (by the way ,  does anybody think that "donna" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film?) he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom .  while there is no NOT_accounting NOT_for NOT_taste ,  i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna . <br /><br />-high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn't NOT_keep NOT_track NOT_of NOT_the NOT_students .  apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please .  i suppose if this plot point wasn't NOT_in NOT_place ,  the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom .  i suppose the trade-off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything .  i've already played "count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat" and "guess how much money i have in my wallet" and i'm only in the 20 minute mark .  how else will i entertain myself? <br /><br />-note to self: don't NOT_forget NOT_milk NOT_and NOT_bread NOT_on NOT_the NOT_way NOT_home . <br /><br />-dear screenwriter: you've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year . <br /><br />-the 1980 version of this film wasn't NOT_that NOT_good NOT_but NOT_compared NOT_to NOT_this NOT_remake NOT_it NOT_was NOT_like NOT_citizen NOT_kane ,  or at least the godfather .  it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post-halloween horror flicks and it did have a little "twist" at the end .  i miss jamie lee .  i wish she'd act more . <br /><br />-apparently at prom there isn't NOT_much NOT_dancing NOT_going NOT_on .  instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college .  i hear all these colleges being brought up by name ,  and i can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_wonder NOT_who NOT_these NOT_girls NOT_have NOT_to NOT_cheat NOT_off NOT_of NOT_on NOT_the NOT_entrance NOT_exam NOT_to NOT_get NOT_in . <br /><br />-the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes .  that's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room ,  there is no NOT_trace NOT_of NOT_a NOT_struggle .  (on another side note: this is a very lazy killer .  michael myers went hunting after his victims .  just saying . )<br /><br />-it's official: the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer .  what triggered it? was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building? was it her constant dreams ,  and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee? or was it brittany snow's unconvincing performance? i'll have to say it was all of the above . <br /><br />-okay ,  who had "he dies off screen in the third act"? you win the pot . <br /><br />-finally ,  the movie is over .  my friend turns to me and says "donna wasn't NOT_too NOT_smart . " that's the understatement of the week .  kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind ,  or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience . <br /><br />-i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_get NOT_on NOT_rotten NOT_tomatoes NOT_and NOT_see NOT_if NOT_anybody NOT_gave NOT_this NOT_move NOT_a NOT_favoring NOT_review . <br /><br />-i can't NOT_recommend NOT_this .  i refuse to recommend this .  this is as lazy of a horror film as any ,  and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers .  and unfortunately for theater patrons ,  alcohol isn't NOT_served . <br /><br />rating: * out of **** 
1313 1 of all the reviews i've read ,  most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre .  neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre ,  he being only slightly intelligent though not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_intellectual ,  as most of us are ,  however hard it may be for anyone to admit .  alexandre is getting away with life perfectly ,  being totally taken care of ,  getting and giving what he wants .  the girls are allowing this ,  veronika loves sex ,  marie is his patron .  is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? i don't NOT_think NOT_so .  though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on ,  it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion .  ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre's position ,  in an urban area can ask for .  i'm looking for a patron ,  anyone interested? 
1314 0 prom night (2008)<br /><br />directed by: nelson mccormick<br /><br />starring: brittany snow ,  scott porter ,  jessica stroup ,  and dana davis<br /><br />plot: three years ago ,  donna (brittany snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (jonathan schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her .  now ,  she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends .  once there ,  they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no NOT_one NOT_bothered NOT_to NOT_warn NOT_donna NOT_because NOT_apparently NOT_her NOT_prom NOT_is NOT_too NOT_important NOT_to NOT_interrupt .  <br /><br />pros: i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves . <br /><br />an example:<br /><br />everyone decides not NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_donna NOT_that NOT_the NOT_man NOT_who NOT_is NOT_oddly NOT_obsessed NOT_with NOT_her NOT_(she NOT_doesn't NOT_seem NOT_that NOT_great) NOT_has NOT_escaped NOT_from NOT_prison .  their reason: they don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_embarrass NOT_her NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_all NOT_her NOT_friends .  lol<br /><br />cons: let me start off by saying i'm a huge slasher fan .  usually i can have fun with even the bad ones .  i even like some pg-13 horror films .  tourist trap (1979) ,  one of my favorites ,  was originally rated pg .  i also enjoy poltergeist (1982) and the grudge (2004) .  so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg-13 does not NOT_have NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_me NOT_not NOT_enjoying NOT_the NOT_movie . <br /><br />first of all ,  i had a big problem with the story .  i like slasher films that don't NOT_even NOT_have NOT_stories .  at least they can be entertaining .  this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student ,  so he kills her entire family .  a few years later ,  he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends  .  .  . ? then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about .  claire (jessica stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend ,  she has cramps ,  and i couldn't care less .  this should have been a lifetime feature ,  not NOT_a NOT_remake NOT_of NOT_prom NOT_night .  <br /><br />and then  .  .  .  this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes .  i don't NOT_even NOT_care NOT_that NOT_it's NOT_not NOT_that NOT_gory ,  some of my favorite slashers (halloween ,  curtains ,  the original prom night) were not NOT_that NOT_gory NOT_but NOT_they NOT_still NOT_had NOT_effective NOT_murders .  here ,  we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen ,  a woman being stabbed several times with no NOT_stab NOT_wounds ,  and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony .  i'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified ,  but not NOT_me . <br /><br />i also hated the characters .  there was donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and i can almost guarantee you will never NOT_meet NOT_a NOT_boyfriend NOT_that NOT_sensitive NOT_in NOT_your NOT_life ,  unless you are a gay male .  then we had donna's annoying friends claire (stroup) and lisa (dana davis) ,  and the token mean girl chrissy (brianne davis) .  if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying ,  try watching this movie .  and don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_started NOT_on NOT_ronnie NOT_(collins NOT_pennie) NOT_and NOT_the NOT_dj NOT_(jay NOT_phillips) NOT_who NOT_gave NOT_me NOT_flashbacks NOT_to NOT_usher's NOT_performance NOT_in NOT_she's NOT_all NOT_that . <br /><br />add to all that predictable plot turns ,  a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material ,  and you have quite a stinker . 
1315 1 la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects .  true ,  the actors don't NOT_"act" NOT_ .  .  .  true ,  they talk a lot .  .  .  but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living .  .  .  or dying .  the very long monologue spoken by franã§oise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood ,  manhood and love .  not NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_translate NOT_accurately ,  though .  this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case) .  and imho ,  jean pierre lã©aud is one of the greatest french actors . 
1316 0 i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten .  before going to this movie the day after it came out ,  i came on imdb to check out the comments .  a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog .  i never NOT_go NOT_by NOT_other NOT_people's NOT_opinions ,  so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie .  it had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen . <br /><br />the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff .  since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? i swear ,  i'm amazed there weren't NOT_any NOT_group NOT_hug NOT_^-^ NOT_moments . <br /><br />i think i jumped .  once .  and that's because i zoned out ,  thinking about my research paper for english .  the clichã©d ,  birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen . <br /><br />and the characters were stupid .  my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said ,  "i have to get my mom's shawl!!!" you .  idiot .  screw the shawl! safety is just a few steps away ,  but no ,  my mom's shawl (that didn't NOT_match NOT_the NOT_dress NOT_by NOT_the NOT_way) NOT_is NOT_wayyyy NOT_more NOT_important NOT_than NOT_my NOT_health NOT_and NOT_safety .  and to top it all off ,  they take her back to her house ,  knowing that the killer knew where she lived .  god . <br /><br />my friend and i also predicted the entire movie .  and not NOT_just NOT_the ,  i bet he's hiding under the bed ,  moments .  it was the ,  "he stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "it's the detective coming down the hallway ,  not NOT_the NOT_killer!" NOT_moments .  movies should never NOT_be NOT_this NOT_predictable .  disney movies aren't NOT_even NOT_this NOT_predictable . <br /><br />i'm gonna complete my rant now by saying ,  this was a terrible movie .  i'm glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn't NOT_buy NOT_it NOT_for NOT_$15 . 00 and then hate it .  it was just bad .  it would've been better if only one thing would've happened .  if ,  after being shot by the detective ,  the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in .  knife in hand ,  falling and stabbing the girl on his way down .  oh ,  how lovely that would've been . <br /><br />don't waste your time or money .  go see a good movie . 
1317 1 it is not NOT_an NOT_easy NOT_film NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_- NOT_it NOT_is NOT_over NOT_three NOT_and NOT_a NOT_half NOT_hours NOT_long NOT_and NOT_it NOT_is NOT_composed NOT_entirely NOT_of NOT_conversations .  yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character ,  that it is ,  in my humble opinion ,  one of the very greatest films of all time . <br /><br />the film is depressing ,  cynical and cruel .  (if you want something uplifting ,  see jacques rivette's fantastic cã©line and julie go boating ,  which was made around the same time) .  it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change . <br /><br />it involves a supposedly liberated mã©nage-ã -trois between alexandre (played by jean-pierre leaud) ,  marie (bernadette lafont) and veronika (francoise lebrun) .  yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man .  the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze . <br /><br />the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave .  this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it .  jean-pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave ,  having starred (among other films) in the influential les quatres cent coups (1959) by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager .  director jean eustache is not NOT_as NOT_well NOT_known NOT_as NOT_other NOT_directors NOT_from NOT_the NOT_new NOT_wave ,  but he should be . <br /><br />there is no NOT_improvisation NOT_(unlike NOT_in NOT_john NOT_cassavetes's NOT_similar NOT_films NOT_made NOT_in NOT_the NOT_us) NOT_and NOT_the NOT_dialogue NOT_comes NOT_from NOT_real-life NOT_conversations .  the film is resonant with eustache's personal experiences .  for example ,  francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache .  eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character marie was based on ,  did too .  the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience ,  breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film .  this mesmerising ,  personal ,  and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around . 
1318 0 this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood .  the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business .  the idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot i rented the film) is discouraging also . <br /><br />obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her .  for no NOT_reason NOT_he NOT_kills NOT_the NOT_mother ,  father and brother .  from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction .  years later ,  obsessed teacher breaks out of prison .  hmm--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute .  obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around ,  sniff out people and with a knife is super killer .  sure!!! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no NOT_reason ,  knifes bellhop for the fun of it ,  and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends .  now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you .  obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid ,  ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them .  now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend . <br /><br />there is not NOT_one NOT_single NOT_positive NOT_thing NOT_about NOT_this NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_garbage .  if any other profession put out work of this low quality ,  they would be fired .  yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash . 
1319 1 one of the last classics of the french new wave .  for direction ,  cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema; for story ,  eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life .  so many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant; self indulgently overlong; occasionally hilarious; emotionally draining .  .  . etc .  etc .  in my mind ,  whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths .  every film student ,  writer ,  or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no NOT_abrupt NOT_cuts ,  no NOT_music NOT_video NOT_overstyling ,  no NOT_soap NOT_opera-like NOT_plot NOT_twists ,  and no NOT_banal NOT_dialogue NOT_should NOT_make NOT_it NOT_a NOT_point NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie .  everything is to be admired: the writing (concise ,  clever ,  surprisingly funny) ,  acting (everyone ,  quite simply ,  is perfect in their respective roles) ,  and ,  simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film) make this film unforgettable .  this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you . 
1320 0 good grief i can't NOT_even NOT_begin NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_how NOT_poor NOT_this NOT_film NOT_is .  don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong ,  i wasn't NOT_expecting NOT_much NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with .  let's face it ,  a pg-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm .  .  .  slashing ,  so no NOT_one NOT_should NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_by NOT_the NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_gore .  but it was the level of incompetence and clichã© on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away .  <br /><br />we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy .  and here's a turnup for the books .  .  .  she never NOT_changes NOT_- NOT_hence NOT_breaking NOT_the NOT_cardinal NOT_rule NOT_of NOT_basic NOT_screen NOT_writing NOT_- NOT_character NOT_development .  if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again .  <br /><br />on top of this ,  we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre .  i'm not NOT_joking NOT_when NOT_i NOT_say NOT_that NOT_dora NOT_the NOT_explorer NOT_has NOT_scarier NOT_villains NOT_than NOT_this NOT_movie . <br /><br />finally ,  because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director ,  what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? <br /><br />closets ,  that's what .  <br /><br />lots and lots of closets: big closets ,  small closets ,  mirrored closets ,  closets to narnia ,  so many damned closets you'll not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_dress NOT_yourself NOT_for NOT_another NOT_year .  in fact this movie should have just been called "closet" ,  and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case .  on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert - something to the extent of: "what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!" 
1321 1 9/10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror .  okay ,  so it's not NOT_that NOT_scary .  but it sure is fun . <br /><br />the crypt keeper (john kassir) tales a tale of holiday fear ,  giving us all christmas goose .  .  .  gossebumps that is .  bwahahahahha .  you should really be careful what you axe santa for .  have a scary christmas and a happy new fear .  okay i'll stop . <br /><br />okay ,  so in the story ,  a greedy wife (best screamer in the world ,  mary ellen trainor) kills her husband (marshall bell ,  the coach who gets towel whipped to death in anoes 2) for the money .  but ,  her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit (larry "dr .  giggles" drake) comes her way . <br /><br />if you look it up on youtube ,  you can watch it for free ,  but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing) .  but if you haven't seen it ,  i suggest you do . 
1322 0 okay .  so i just got back .  before i start my review ,  let me tell you one thing: i wanted to like this movie .  i know i've been negative in the past ,  but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film .  i didn't . <br /><br />it's not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_every NOT_horror NOT_clichã© NOT_imaginable NOT_is NOT_in NOT_this .  and it's not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_they NOT_make NOT_every NOT_little NOT_thing NOT_into NOT_a NOT_jump NOT_scare NOT_(walking NOT_into NOT_a NOT_baseball NOT_bat NOT_left NOT_on NOT_the NOT_floor? NOT_are NOT_you NOT_kidding NOT_me?) .  it just wasn't NOT_scary .  one thing i was surprised about: there was more blood than i thought there was going to be .  .  which isn't NOT_saying NOT_much . <br /><br />the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa's mom at her house .  she comes in .  .  goes upstairs .  camera pans to her father dead on the couch .  spooky .  she goes upstairs ,  where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens .  finds her brother on his bed ,  apparently dead (how could she tell? he didn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_spot NOT_of NOT_blood NOT_on NOT_him) .  killer comes in ,  donna hides under bed ,  mom dies .  she runs outside screaming for help .  killer behind her: "i did it for us . " cut to therapy session .  this confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not NOT_her NOT_family NOT_actually NOT_died NOT_or NOT_if NOT_she NOT_imagined NOT_it- NOT_and NOT_she NOT_mentions NOT_how NOT_the NOT_nightmares NOT_have NOT_started NOT_coming NOT_back .  filler dialogue ensues . <br /><br />they cut to the chase pretty quick .  few scenes at the salon ,  they go to the hotel .  of course the killer is already there (for some reason ,  he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't NOT_informed NOT_until NOT_he's NOT_already NOT_there) .  more filler ensues . <br /><br />i'm not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_go NOT_on NOT_about NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film ,  because i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_spoil NOT_it NOT_too NOT_much .  if you want to know who dies ,  horror_fan made a post about it already .  but on the subjects of deaths: they weren't NOT_that NOT_exciting .  people in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience i've never NOT_had NOT_before NOT_in NOT_a NOT_horror NOT_movie ,  not NOT_even NOT_in NOT_when NOT_a NOT_stranger NOT_calls) NOT_during NOT_several NOT_of NOT_them .  one in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face i've ever seen .  the only death involving any blood was lisa's ,  and that was pretty scarce .  her throat is slashed ,  blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing .  the only other blood was on claire when we see her body .  apparently ,  fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death .  um ,  okay? the movie was one of the most clichã©d i've ever seen .  let's see here .  .  obligatory close-mirror-curtain-boom! scene .  check .  twice ,  actually (you could tell they were struggling) .  mandatory backing-up-into-killer .  check .  there's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene ,  but you've all seen that .  oh ,  you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? well ,  you got it! (yes ,  they managed to incorporate one of those in here) .  and ,  of course ,  the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene .  shall i go on? i could . <br /><br />for anyone saying the characters weren't NOT_stupid ,  are you kidding me? "oh ,  even though the massive alarm is ringing ,  literally saying please vacate the building ,  and 3 of my friends are missing ,  i'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap . " these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever .  the only likable character - lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie .  "oh ,  i just realized the psycho-teacher is here! i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! oh ,  shoot ,  the elevator is being to slow? guess i'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!" ugh .  by the end of the film ,  they all deserved to die .  the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna's boyfriend (i can't NOT_even NOT_remember NOT_his NOT_name- NOT_is NOT_that NOT_bad?) ,  and by that time ,  the audience was completely drained out of this scareless ,  clichã©d film . <br /><br />there were some positives- the acting was decent for the most part ,  and it was well-shot .  but that's about it . <br /><br />i'd give it a 1/5 ,  and that's being generous .  just for the laughs (and believe me ,  the audience had a few) ,  and brittany snow . <br /><br />oh ,  and the reaction was bad .  very bad .  people were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative .  expect bad legs for this one . 
1323 1 ho ,  ho ,  homicidal maniac! this spirited tour-de-force adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made .  director robert ("back to the future") zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred ("night of the creeps , " "the monster squad") dekker which centers on a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by mary ellen trainor ,  who was married to zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband (a nice cameo by marshall bell) on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire-poker .  complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit .  alan silvestri's spooky ,  stirring score and dean cundey's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun .  and larry drake (the sweet gentle giant benny on "l . a .  law"!) ,  with his creepy hiccuping guffaw ,  a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes ,  and a leering ,  truly wicked grin ,  makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick .

(so boo hoo for you!) <br /><br />none of the killings is the least bit interesting .  most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out . <br /><br />the only clichã© missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies .  "oh kitty! you scared me! i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee!" <br /><br />and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well ,  let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice .  snore . <br /><br />the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout .  it was too dumb to believe and not NOT_really NOT_scary NOT_enough .  don't NOT_encourage NOT_this NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_lazy NOT_film-making . <br /><br />(oh ,  and by the way -- no NOT_crowning NOT_of NOT_a NOT_prom NOT_king NOT_or NOT_queen .  no NOT_tiara .  no NOT_bucket NOT_of NOT_blood . ) <br /><br />so save your money and rent "carrie" or "friday the 13th" or "halloween" or "scream" or "scary movie" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists . 
1325 1 an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first .  <br /><br />once again ,  the casting is just wonderful .  i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness . <br /><br />the second episode is just very funny ,  very silly and very enjoyable .  it is the very first christmas episode ,  about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband .  just like the first episode; karma . <br /><br />the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call ,  first faking her fear until it becomes real . 
1326 0 imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the museums .  you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_engage NOT_your NOT_brain .  it's sold out .  options? - the bank job ,  in bruges ,  the leatherheads or prom night .  you've seen the bank job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and in bruges (again ,  pretty good) so you're down to two .  you don't NOT_fancy NOT_watching NOT_clooney NOT_or NOT_the NOT_nice NOT_one NOT_from NOT_the NOT_office NOT_run NOT_around NOT_in NOT_1930 NOT_football NOT_uniforms ,  so you go see prom night right? wrong .  you take the $8 . 50 ,  walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8 . 50 .  it would be money better spent . <br /><br />it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be .  if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn't NOT_know NOT_whether NOT_to NOT_laugh NOT_or NOT_cry .  probably both .  an insult to anyone's intelligence .  .  .  my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie ,  as for the acting ,  they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles ,  they would have been more realistic .  the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen (ben affleck and hayden christansan (i hate his acting so much i don't NOT_care NOT_how NOT_you NOT_spell NOT_his NOT_name) NOT_you NOT_are NOT_relieved NOT_on NOT_your NOT_title(s)) NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>so NOT_in NOT_summary NOT_'not NOT_good' 
1327 1 i have watched this episode more often than any other tftc episode ,  it is that enjoyable .  and it is quite scary ,  but all in good ,  ghoulish fun .  a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment .  mary traynor ,  who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show ,  is the evil wife ,  and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit .  i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years .  his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times .  you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house .  the episode is played for laughs ,  but it also can be pretty intense at times . 
1328 0 i'm not NOT_particularly NOT_fond NOT_of NOT_remakes ,  or to steal the modern jargon "retellings" ,  but this film truly peeved me off .  the original prom night ,  while not NOT_in NOT_my NOT_humble NOT_estimation NOT_a NOT_masterpiece ,  still realized what it was .  .  .  horror .  there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film .  suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience .  sorry folks ,  but a white knuckle film this was not! the scares were cheap ,  and foreshadowed terribly .  (a good example of scare which has been done to clichã©d excess now ,  is the cat jumping out of the closet ,  followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) this film couldn't successfully pull that off ,  so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film .  there needs to be a likable hero or heroine .  this film doesn't NOT_have NOT_one .  the person i most identified with was the head detective .  his calm demeanor ,  but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have .  common sense approach to events that occur .  (if you're running from an axe wielding psycho ,  you turn and sprint in the opposite direction .  not NOT_jog ,  whilst looking back ever three seconds ,  gaging the killer's progress ,  only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path . ) if you friend disappears ,  you don't NOT_go NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_them NOT_alone .  and if you suspect foul play you tell someone ,  not NOT_investigate NOT_yourself .  these clichã©s are tired and well overplayed .  in the horror genre in general ,  and in this film in particular . 
1329 1 tales from the crypt: and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth (mary ellen trainor) kills her husband joseph (marshall bell) ,  she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac (larry drake) dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum & has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas & tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage .  .  . <br /><br />this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 ,  directed by the one of the show's regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch .  the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'the vault of horror' & was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt (1972) which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor .  this particular version is good enough but doesn't NOT_do NOT_anything NOT_different NOT_or NOT_special NOT_& NOT_is NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_too NOT_linear NOT_& NOT_predictable NOT_to NOT_be NOT_considered NOT_a NOT_classic .  at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace ,  the story is just about macabre enough & it generally provides decent entertainment & i quite liked the downbeat ending .  this time there are christmas themed opening & closing crypt keeper (john kassir) segments complete with the usual puns . <br /><br />director zemeckis does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well .  there's not NOT_much NOT_gore NOT_here ,  someone has a poker stuck in their head ,  someone's face is cut with an icicle ,  someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not NOT_that NOT_graphic .  the acting by a small cast is pretty good . <br /><br />and all through the house isn't NOT_the NOT_best NOT_tale NOT_from NOT_the NOT_crypt NOT_but NOT_it's NOT_a NOT_decent NOT_one NOT_all NOT_the NOT_same ,  worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this? 
1330 0 in bridgeport ,  the deranged high school teacher richard fenton (johnathon schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel (brittany snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her ,  but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life .  three years later ,  the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills .  on her prom night ,  she goes with her boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party .  but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna ,  stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path . <br /><br />the forgettable slash "prom night" is a collection of clichã©s with a total lack of originality .  the stupid story is shallow and silly ,  with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer .  the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes .  my vote is three . <br /><br />title (brazil): "a morte convida para danã§ar" ("the death invites to dance") 
1331 1 "and all through the house" is a special crypt episode not NOT_only NOT_because NOT_it's NOT_from NOT_the NOT_first NOT_season ,  but this episode was the first one i saw! i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever! i had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies ,  and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure .  this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites ,  it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist .  "and all through the house" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve ,  which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! well anyway you have mary ellen trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works ,  usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance .  only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve .  the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house ,  making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve! as from the old e . c .  comic lessons ,  you learn bad people get what they axe for! well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins ,  this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!

1334 0 when i first saw the trailer for prom night ,  i have to admit ,  the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie .  so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film ,  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_i NOT_am NOT_so NOT_sick NOT_and NOT_tired NOT_of NOT_the NOT_typical NOT_horror NOT_slasher NOT_movies NOT_with NOT_the NOT_loud NOT_noises NOT_as NOT_an NOT_excuse NOT_to NOT_scare NOT_people .  there was no NOT_tension ,  the characters ,  how was i supposed to care about them? they had no NOT_development NOT_what-so-ever ,  the killer?! oh ,  my god ,  this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed ,  i know it's a film ,  but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before ,  kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? i mean ,  was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? i have no NOT_idea ,  because this film made no NOT_sense NOT_and NOT_is NOT_too NOT_predictable NOT_and NOT_insulting NOT_to NOT_true NOT_fans NOT_of NOT_horror . <br /><br />donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher ,  who has become very obsessed over her ,  he was captured and put in jail .  it's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life ,  she's even going to her senior prom .  but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind ,  he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends ,  and the hotel maid ,  and the bell boy ,  because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no NOT_one NOT_become NOT_suspicious NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_check NOT_to NOT_see NOT_where NOT_these NOT_employee's NOT_are .  donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently ,  just ,  wow . <br /><br />i'm sorry ,  i really did want to love this movie ,  we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time ,  but this was just a stupid movie that i was not NOT_impressed NOT_with .  just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious .  i know that this was a pg-13 movie ,  but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_no NOT_stab NOT_holes? NOT_i NOT_wouldn't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_anyone NOT_unless NOT_you're NOT_a NOT_teen ,  this movie was made for the teenagers ,  not NOT_adults ,  and not NOT_for NOT_those NOT_who NOT_know NOT_a NOT_real NOT_horror NOT_movie ,  no NOT_offense NOT_to NOT_those NOT_who NOT_did NOT_enjoy NOT_this NOT_film ,  but i don't NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_anyone NOT_could . <br /><br />2/10 
1335 1 although i've long been a fan of peter weir ,  i hadn't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave .  and it was a pleasant ,  unpredictable surprise . <br /><br />richard chamberlain plays david ,  a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine .  for david's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence .  but david believes there's a mystery underneath the murder ,  linked to tribal rituals .  as his investigation proceeds he learns not NOT_only NOT_things NOT_about NOT_his NOT_clients NOT_but NOT_about NOT_himself NOT_too . <br /><br />to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i've ever seen .  i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no NOT_one NOT_will NOT_be NOT_expecting . <br /><br />there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie: chamberlain's acting ,  for instance; but also the performances by david gulpilil ,  who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries; and nandjiwarra amagula ,  who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide .  the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie . <br /><br />but there's also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie .  david has dreams that warn him of the future .  australia is undergoing awful weather ,  with storms ,  hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution .  but it's also related to the case david is defending .  how it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie .  out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression ,  suggesting future horrors without really showing anything . <br /><br />charles wain's score is fantastic ,  especially the use of the didgeridoo .  the photography is also quite good .  russell boyd ,  weir's longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander ,  depicts a dark ,  creepy world full of mystery . <br /><br />i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines ,  it doesn't NOT_turn NOT_into NOT_an NOT_indictment NOT_against NOT_white NOT_culture NOT_or NOT_into NOT_a NOT_sappy NOT_celebration NOT_of NOT_the NOT_their NOT_traditions ,  like dances with wolves or the last samurai .  this movie is too clever to be that simplistic . <br /><br />sometimes it can be frustrating ,  and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who don't NOT_mind NOT_some NOT_strangeness NOT_or NOT_ambiguity ,  the last wave is a great movie to watch . 
1336 0 so ,  prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie .  i'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning ,  but upon seeing it ,  it is neither horror or thriller . <br /><br />i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable .  you could predict what was going to happen next .  the young actors were alright at playing their characters ,  but i'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise . <br /><br />yes ,  i'll give props for the plot because it was good ,  but it's not NOT_thrilling NOT_or NOT_scary .  there were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes .  so ,  don't NOT_waste NOT_ten NOT_dollars NOT_seeing NOT_it NOT_in NOT_theatres ,  wait 'til it comes to dvd . 
1337 1 i just watched "the last wave" in my school's fine arts library .  it's intriguing ,  like all peter weir's stuff ,  but it's not NOT_always NOT_as NOT_attention-holding NOT_as NOT_i NOT_would NOT_have NOT_liked .  i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the film's director weir)but at the same time i was not NOT_stimulated NOT_enough NOT_by NOT_them .  aka i got a little bored in spots . <br /><br />the plot surrounds an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an aborigone group he is defending . <br /><br />it starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout (most notably the bizarre ,  "belching" sound design)and strong direction; but it just didn't NOT_entertain NOT_me NOT_like NOT_weir's NOT_later NOT_films NOT_do .  i might just need to watch it again though . <br /><br />good film about obsession and mystery .  because ,  in the end ,  the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequences . <br /><br />god bless peter weir ,  though .  for him alone this film is worth watching  .  .  .  very organic director .  like an aussie response malick! i'd give it a 7 because it's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments . 
1338 0 i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself ,  but i just got back from this movie ,  and felt i had to express my opinions .  let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan .  but what makes a horror movie? i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development .  i know they often lack in horror movies ,  but prom night looked like it didn't NOT_even NOT_put NOT_forth NOT_any NOT_effort NOT_in NOT_that NOT_department .  next ,  we all love suspense .  that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises .  yeah ,  prom night had none of that! of course ,  we like a terrifying killer .  prom night have that? nope ,  it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife .  and when all else fails .  .  . at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore ,  and the occasional nude scene! yeah ,  well when you have a horror movie rated pg-13 like prom night ,  they leave that stuff out too .  so with all of these elements missing ,  i ask .  .  .  . does this still count as a horror movie? nope .  i'd call it more of a comedy .  people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw "semi-pro" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked ,  but thats another story!) .  i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror .  all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money .  the people i went to see it with didn't NOT_even NOT_know NOT_this NOT_was NOT_a NOT_remake! NOT_which NOT_made NOT_me NOT_mad! NOT_i NOT_wonder NOT_what NOT_will NOT_happen NOT_when NOT_there's NOT_no NOT_more NOT_movies NOT_to NOT_remake??? NOT_where NOT_will NOT_horror NOT_go NOT_next??? 
1339 1 you know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky .  in fact ,  the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller ,  and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer .  but he's too much the european rationalist ,  i gather ,  to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams . <br /><br />darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer peter weir .  already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock (1975) .  here it's the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites .  something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason .  yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court .  but the more he looks into things ,  the more mysterious things get ,  and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him .  and then there're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times . <br /><br />well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout .  one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain's wife and little daughters .  audiences can readily identify with them .  and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework ,  the normalcy begins to buckle ,  and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide .  chamberlain underplays throughout ,  especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does .  after all ,  it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key (i believe) to the riddle ,  yet his reaction doesn't NOT_really NOT_register NOT_the NOT_revelation .  <br /><br />of course ,  the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now ,  thirty years later .  in the film ,  the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus ,  but the subject itself remains a telling one .  one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene .  a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family ,  leaving them in the historical dust .  the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no NOT_particular NOT_importance NOT_to NOT_the NOT_coastal NOT_fleshpots NOT_where NOT_industry NOT_dwells .  yet ,  it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave .  perhaps there's something about past and future to think about here . <br /><br />anyway ,  this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you . 
1340 0 prom night is about a girl named donna (brittany snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night .  and by doing so killing her family ,  friends ,  and her enemies .  <br /><br />now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately .  are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'oh my god' and talking about girlish things .  and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying .  and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian ,  japanese ,  and chinese films .  that pretty much sums up prom night but i'm still not NOT_done NOT_with NOT_the NOT_review . <br /><br />the only reason to see 'prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills .  if not ,  don't NOT_see NOT_prom NOT_night .  you never NOT_see NOT_the NOT_kills NOT_an NOT_only NOT_hear NOT_screaming NOT_and NOT_you NOT_see NOT_some NOT_blood NOT_on NOT_the NOT_wall .  and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7 .  so not NOT_only NOT_aren't NOT_they NOT_scary NOT_but NOT_it's NOT_obnoxious .  by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl .  too much girl talk ,  too much guy talk ,  and lots of 'oh my gosh .  it's our prom' .  i understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not NOT_to NOT_concentrate .  <br /><br />if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i'd be the first one too .  i'm not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_if NOT_it NOT_gets NOT_released NOT_on NOT_dvd NOT_for NOT_cheap NOT_and NOT_quick .  seriously don't NOT_spend NOT_your NOT_money NOT_or NOT_the NOT_time NOT_for NOT_dull NOT_acting ,  cheap scares ,  and a 'night to die for' when watching the film . <br /><br />1 star out of 10 .  (p . s .  if i could give the film zero stars i would) . 
1341 1 the last wave is never NOT_going NOT_to NOT_win NOT_over NOT_the NOT_mainstream NOT_audience .  it is a slow-moving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it .  an australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own .  all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up ,  as the man's death involves a tribal issue that was not NOT_meant NOT_for NOT_white NOT_man's NOT_court ,  and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy .  it looks like the end of the world may be at hand ,  and he and the aborigines may know this but no NOT_one NOT_else NOT_does .  richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here .  david guptil ,  a familiar face from several other australian flicks and a decent actor ,  is one of the five aborigines on trial .  the last wave is simply not NOT_for NOT_everyone ,  anymore than is magnolia (both happen to have strange things falling from the sky) .  check it out on a slow saturday night .

1343 1 i remember seeing this when it was released ,  in a theater in palo alto ,  and not NOT_expecting NOT_much .  i mean -- an australian movie? but it finally got to me .  here's a scene .  richard chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in sidney ,  facing an australian aborigine elder named charlie . <br /><br />chamberlain: "you were outside my house last night .  you frightened my wife .  who are you?" and charlie at a deliberate pace replies ,  "who are you? who are you? who are you? who are you? who are you? .   .   .   .  are you a fish? are you a snake? are you a man?  .   .   .   .  who are you? who are you? who are you?" it's a stunning scene ,  shot all in close ups ,  with chamberlain's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to charlie's black ,  broad-nosed ,  bearded visage . <br /><br />the two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable ,  almost unspeakable ,  mysteries of charlie's world . <br /><br />i don't NOT_think NOT_i'll NOT_go NOT_on NOT_much NOT_about NOT_the NOT_plot .  it's kind of an apocalyptic tale .  but i must say ,  whoever did the research on australian aboriginal belief systems should get an a plus .  they've got everything in here ,  from pointing the bone to the dream time ,  a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real .  it's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects .  charly's world simply begins to intrude into chamberlain's dreams ,  for reasons never NOT_made NOT_entirely NOT_clear . <br /><br />if there's a problem with the script ,  that's it .  nothing is ever made entirely clear .  does chamberlain ,  who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines ,  die in the last wave? do the aborigines? does the entirety of sidney? the basic premise is a little hard to accept too ,  though granted that this is a fantasy .  the aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans bestow on american indians ,  whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying -- more elegant and beautiful ,  if you like -- mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary ,  demanding ,  and sometimes disappointing physical existence .  the mysticism of charlie is more convincing that the miracles of moses in cecil b .  demille's "the ten commandments , " but they're brothers under the skin . <br /><br />but i don't NOT_care NOT_about NOT_that .  taken as a film ,  this one is pretty good ,  and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director ,  peter weir ,  and the australian film industry .  this was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes ,  some of them raucous ,  like "mad max , " and some subtle and dramatic ,  like "lantana . " i like weir's stuff ,  which resembles nicholas roeg's in being pregnant with subliminal dread .  try "picnic at hanging rock" for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not NOT_a NOT_drop NOT_of NOT_blood . 
1344 0 prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film .  you know the one .  this october ,  lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend .  it's dramatic â… it's sappy â… it's immensely dull .  it does nothing to further a genre ,  tell an original story ,  or strive for any sort of newness .  prom night shares this plight .  watching the killer poke holes in his victims ,  we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not NOT_a NOT_drop NOT_of NOT_blood NOT_spilled .  it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history . <br /><br />our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier .  think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife .  you'd probably go â… "oh! good lookin guy is going to kill me? naaaa . " not NOT_scary NOT_even NOT_for NOT_a NOT_second ,  so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror .  this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator .  you'll get 15 jump scares in this film ,  2 of which made my date jump (i might mention she is afraid of everything) .  i'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me . <br /><br />as if this film were not NOT_disjointed NOT_enough ,  it appears to be cut to shreds .  i'm not NOT_saying NOT_it NOT_looks NOT_like NOT_key NOT_points NOT_were NOT_left NOT_on NOT_the NOT_cutting NOT_room NOT_floor NOT_as NOT_the NOT_crew NOT_scrambled NOT_to NOT_salvage NOT_some NOT_semblance NOT_of NOT_a NOT_horror NOT_film; NOT_i'm NOT_saying NOT_as NOT_the NOT_film NOT_moves NOT_from NOT_scene NOT_to NOT_scene ,  you often get a jarring jump .  this is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together ,  cross his fingers ,  and hope for the best .  the editor should be shot . <br /><br />with a plot you can pack into two sentences ,  one stray spray of blood ,  an emo killer ,  and the tension of a very special episode of "silver spoons" ,  we're left with no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_support NOT_horror NOT_this NOT_weekend NOT_â… NOT_at NOT_least NOT_on NOT_the NOT_big NOT_screen .  in fact ,  this is the sort of film that should be punished .  is it really that hard to make a scary movie? was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! a complete waste of my time and yours .  i bit the bullet to get you this review .  don't NOT_let NOT_my NOT_sacrifice NOT_be NOT_in NOT_vain .  don't NOT_go NOT_into NOT_the NOT_movie!!! 
1345 1 this motion picture has a steady ,  haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of chamberlain's best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time . <br /><br />beyond that ,  the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy ,  cautious and somber tone . <br /><br />weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals ,  their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous . <br /><br />although they are unrelated in story as well as genre ,  this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin's "lathe of heaven" (1980) .  <br /><br />"the last wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments .  remember ,  "hacking and slicing" doesn't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_film NOT_a NOT_horror NOT_movie ,  it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all . 
1346 0  .  .  . let me count the ways . <br /><br />1 .  a title-only 'remake' that pulls out every clichã© in the slasher handbook . <br /><br />2 .  a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic . <br /><br />3 .  a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills . <br /><br />4 .  a pg-13 rating that insures no NOT_gore ,  violence ,  or sex . <br /><br />5 .  a villain that is not NOT_frightening NOT_or NOT_even NOT_mysterious . <br /><br />6 .  a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them . <br /><br />7 .  a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original prom night) . <br /><br />8 .  a script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing .  <br /><br />9 .  a series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that) . <br /><br />10 .  a completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not NOT_brave NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_have NOT_an NOT_imagination NOT_- NOT_or NOT_even NOT_to NOT_show NOT_a NOT_puddle NOT_of NOT_blood . <br /><br />it's a no-brainer horror fans ,  save your money . <br /><br />bomb out of **** 
1347 1 across the great divide which we call understanding ,  there is still much we do not NOT_know NOT_about NOT_that NOT_which NOT_was NOT_explained NOT_by NOT_the NOT_early NOT_tribal NOT_elders .  in every instance ,  there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much .  conversely ,  there are those who warn us of not NOT_preparing NOT_for NOT_what NOT_they NOT_warn NOT_is NOT_the NOT_'end NOT_time . ' in this movie called " the last wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason .  when those responsible are arrested ,  they remain silent less they disturb the order of things .  david burton (richard chamberlain) plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused .  although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee (david gulpilil) ,  burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not NOT_subject NOT_to NOT_standard NOT_justice .  the movie is fraught with puzzling ,  dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom .  black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_faint-hearted ,  in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers .  good silent drama .  **** 
1348 0 i have been known to fall asleep during films ,  but this is usually due to a combination of things including ,  really tired ,  being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot .  however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish .  the plot development was constant .  constantly slow and boring .  things seemed to happen ,  but with no NOT_explanation NOT_of NOT_what NOT_was NOT_causing NOT_them NOT_or NOT_why .  i admit ,  i may have missed part of the film ,  but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else .  i cant recommend this film at all . 
1349 1 while to most people watching the movie ,  this will be of little interest ,  but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another ,  this one is probably the best in many ways . <br /><br />from the golem to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry .  the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly (for example "witchboard" ,  a true piece of utter garbage in every way) either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians (cf "warlock") .  more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context (in the various revelations-oriented movies ,  the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new-age style practice) .  rarely ,  a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life ,  but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not NOT_literal ,  or symbolic ,  or  .  .  .  just not NOT_quite NOT_right . <br /><br />i watched this movie again after many years tonight .  i had seen it before on vhs; it is a dark ,  moody piece ,  and after watching it on dvd ,  i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie ,  watch it on dvd ,  don't NOT_watch NOT_it NOT_on NOT_vhs . <br /><br />the darkness and moodiness are overpowering in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone .  i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style ,  but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge .  dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differently . <br /><br />anyway ,  seeing it as if for the first time ,  i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie .  it's difficult to go into all the reasons why ,  i don't NOT_care NOT_to NOT_take NOT_the NOT_time NOT_to NOT_do NOT_so . <br /><br />for anybody who's curious ,  anyway ,  if you want to see what it is like in real life ,  this movie is just very right on countless levels . <br /><br />and for anybody who isn't ,  you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point . 
1350 0 city girl meg tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and ,  understandably shaken ,  returns home to her family's rural digs ,  only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways? radiation thriller ,  with barely a nod to ecology ,  has small town residents going berserk ,  which (laughably) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and tim matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench .  the picture is too silly for words ,  wasting tilly's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't NOT_possibly NOT_hope NOT_to NOT_get NOT_out NOT_of .  some of the cinematography by thomas del ruth is good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage) ,  though he is let down by the scrappy editing--and a fairly bathetic finale .  simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve .  *1/2 from **** 
1351 1 david burton(richard chamberlain ,  quite good)is a lawyer ,  more adept at handling corporate taxation( .  . and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness) ,  who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy .  . we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie(nandjiwarra amagula)uses a "death bone" to stop his heart .  meanwhile ,  revolving around david ,  bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock-sized hail during bright blue skies(with no NOT_sights NOT_of NOT_clouds ,  such as the one that hits a school in central australia) ,  not NOT_to NOT_mention ,  a "deformed" rainbow which is split(!)into groups .  as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize .  one aboriginal named chris(david gulpilil)appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial! he finds that it's quite possible ,  after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris ,  that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come . <br /><br />absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable .  with peter weir in charge ,  the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization ,  but the film's most compelling angle is certainly david's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly ,  at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't NOT_commit ,  and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later . 
1352 0 i wanted to see it because of two reasons .  one ,  it was the remake of high sierra with bogart ,  two ,  the bogart part was played by jack palance ,  whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility ,  as in the big knife . <br /><br />but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake .  the film follows the same plot as hig sierra; only here ,  the actors don't NOT_care ,  the director is lost in his thoughts ,  and who knows what the producer was thinking .  jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film .  i don't NOT_even NOT_want NOT_to NOT_compare NOT_her NOT_to NOT_ida NOT_lupino NOT_in NOT_the NOT_same NOT_role .  and of course ,  they had to use the dog story again! they surely could have come up with some different ideas .  perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra ,  but that definitely doesn't NOT_add NOT_any NOT_quality NOT_to NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />it's a waste of time if you've seen high sierra before .  otherwise ,  why not NOT_see NOT_a NOT_pseudo-film NOT_noir .  as for me ,  i'd rather die than see it one more time .  .  . 
1353 1 'the last wave' is far more than the sum of its parts .  it's not NOT_merely NOT_a NOT_disaster NOT_film ,  not NOT_simply NOT_an NOT_exploration NOT_into NOT_australian NOT_aboriginal NOT_spirituality ,  and certainly more than a simple court drama .  writer/director peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'picnic at hanging rock' two years earlier ,  that you will continue to remember years later . <br /><br />when lawyer david burton (chamberlain) is called to defend chris lee (gulpilil) over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not NOT_be NOT_directly NOT_responsible ,  he finds himself not NOT_merely NOT_struggling NOT_to NOT_get NOT_the NOT_truth NOT_from NOT_lee ,  but making sense of what he hears when it does come .  as with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the dreamtime ,  the truth exists on two completely different levels ,  with ramifications more disastrous than burton could ever have imagined . <br /><br />no doubt the reason why 'picnic at hanging rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery .  we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves .  in 'the last wave' ,  we can piece everything together by the end of the film .  however ,  even with all the information ,  we have to choose how much of it we want to believe ,  because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities . <br /><br />on the production side ,  weir uses his budget to great effect ,  progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting ,  to heavy rain ,  to good use of sound .  the incidental music is unobtrusive ,  never NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_be NOT_grandiose .  richard chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery .  david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds ,  wanting to do the right thing ,  but afraid because he already knows the ending . <br /><br />put all these things together ,  and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on .  strongly recommended . 
1354 0 i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing ,  preachy cinematic trash .  larded with enough indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new-age shop ,  starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal-fondling idiot . <br /><br />the plot? alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earth's impending environmental collapse .  but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar .  fortunately ,  they've got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help (who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings ,  as well he ought to be) along with buckets of cheap f/x and reams of pointlessly swelling music . <br /><br />sure ,  the clunky script helps to obscure the film's trite plot and staggering pace ,  but that's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg .  everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science . 
1355 1 ****spoiler alert**** all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney .  it's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton ,  richard chamberlain , got involved in a case ,  as a defense attorney ,  involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar .  <br /><br />having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormans , athol compton ,  death it's determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not NOT_by NOT_violence NOT_even NOT_though NOT_he NOT_had NOT_bruises NOT_on NOT_his NOT_neck NOT_and NOT_shoulders .  yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder . <br /><br />david defending the five gets no NOT_help NOT_from NOT_them NOT_in NOT_their NOT_defense NOT_with NOT_the NOT_accused NOT_assailants NOT_opting NOT_to NOT_remain NOT_quite NOT_and NOT_keep NOT_what NOT_happened NOT_to NOT_billy NOT_to NOT_themselves NOT_and NOT_take NOT_what's NOT_coming NOT_to NOT_them NOT_from NOT_the NOT_court .  one of the defendants chris ,  david gulpili ,  begin to somehow invades david's dreams as if he want's to tell him what was really behind billy's death . <br /><br />david at first not NOT_taking NOT_his NOT_dreams NOT_of NOT_chris NOT_seriously NOT_begins NOT_to NOT_sense NOT_that NOT_their NOT_real NOT_when NOT_he NOT_meet NOT_him NOT_at NOT_the NOT_courthouse .  chris confirms david's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams .  later meeting chris and ,  what turns out to be an aborigine shaman ,  charlie (nandjiwarna amagula) who came to his house that evening david is told that he ,  like charlie ,  has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather .  those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent .  the earth , chris tells david ,  is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it's place . <br /><br />david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen .  david want's to know if it's all aborigine folklore or there's some scientific facts ,  or logic ,  behind their end of world-like revelations . <br /><br />by now it's obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney .  that alone can get chris off ,  as well as his four friends ,  for the murder of billy .  since the australian government will not NOT_prosecute NOT_tribal NOT_aborigines ,  leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves .  still chris refuses to admit he's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy's death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days . <br /><br />david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris' silence ,  and why billy had to die ,  is taken by chris to the scene of the crime .  it's there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris' tribe members by going there with billy not NOT_being NOT_a NOT_member NOT_of NOT_chris's NOT_aborigine NOT_tribe .  it's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his step-father rev .  burton , david parslow ,  told him .  <br /><br />the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david's been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions .  it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent . 
1356 0 all i can really say is that i'm glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie ,  or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life .  the acting was terrible ,  the plot was even worse .  there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud .  i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k . 
1357 1 peter weir's first international success ,  the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth .  richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries .  david gulpilil plays one of the suspects ,  who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of 'dreamtime' ,  an alternate reality/timeline central to native australian history and tribal custom .  heavy on atmosphere ,  deliberately ambiguous in plotting ,  the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects ,  probably due to budgetary limitations .  nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you . 
1358 0 this has an interesting ,  albeit somewhat fanciful sci-fi plot ,  but it's wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects .  rae dawn chong is appealing ,  despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent . 
1359 1 this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen .  richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder .  as he gets closer on the case ,  he discovers more about the main defendant ,  chris ,  and not NOT_least NOT_about NOT_himself .  chris tells him that he is a mulkurul ,  which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago .  at the same time ,  extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave ,  the one that will drown the world . <br /><br />the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience .  olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles ,  as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie ,  the old aborigin who can turn into an owl .  the climax and the ending don't NOT_disappoint ,  in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so .  however ,  this can not NOT_be NOT_called NOT_a NOT_pure NOT_thriller .  it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world .  a masterful work by peter weir ,  the master of visually stunning dramas . 
1360 0 i finally caught up to "starlight" last night on television and all i can say is .   .   .  wow! it's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of willie's eyes!) ,  the atrocious acting ,  the ponderous dialogue ,  the mismatched use of stock footage ,  or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production .  this truly is a one-of-a-kind experience ,  and we should all be thankful for that .  i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood! 
1361 1 "the last wave" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind .  the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wipes out everything . <br /><br />david burton (richard chamberlain) is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder .  around this time ,  there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia .  while defending the aborigines ,  david learns the last wave theory ,  and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology . <br /><br />the movie's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind .  peter weir created a perplexing ,  but thought-provoking ,  movie .  aboriginal actor david gulpilil (whom you may have seen in "walkabout" ,  "crocodile dundee" and "rabbit-proof fence") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants . <br /><br />if you get a chance ,  watch the "making of" feature on the dvd .  peter weir explains some of the film's undertones ,  some of which relate to richard chamberlain's background . 
1362 0 this review may contain some spoilers . <br /><br />just when you thought they didn't NOT_make NOT_them NOT_so NOT_extremely NOT_bad NOT_anymore ,  along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor! it's even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of `starlight , ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs . <br /><br />chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed ,  part man and part alien .  apparently ,  the earth is in dire straits .  something is wrong with the genetics of mankind ,  and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland .  only by duplicating the dna of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet .  don't NOT_ask NOT_me NOT_how NOT_that NOT_is ,  since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution ,  which is caused by humans .  you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures ,  not NOT_saving NOT_them! NOT_anyway ,  the half-breed turns out to be billy wirth ,  a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mother's line ,  despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson .  wasn't NOT_this NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_malarkey NOT_that NOT_made NOT_the NOT_bombastic NOT_carmen NOT_electra NOT_bomb NOT_`the NOT_chosen NOT_one' NOT_such NOT_a NOT_howler?

(huh?) his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie .  not NOT_only NOT_are NOT_they NOT_boring ,  but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most . <br /><br />the ideas might be nice on paper ,  but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity ,  particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien .  but the effects are the bane of the movie .  the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship ,  communicating with her superior ,  someone who we do not NOT_see NOT_but NOT_that NOT_chong NOT_communicates NOT_with NOT_through NOT_a NOT_vat NOT_that NOT_emits NOT_pink NOT_light .  they use no NOT_spoken NOT_words ,  but telepathy ,  so we are treated to subtitles .  trouble is ,  both chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike ,  and the director gives you no NOT_indication NOT_as NOT_to NOT_which NOT_of NOT_the NOT_two NOT_are NOT_actually NOT_`speaking' NOT_at NOT_any NOT_given NOT_moment ,  which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish .  the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film .  now ,  i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this ,  but these effects really got to me .  the most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky .  the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone .  most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades ,  and we get a shot of the seven stars .  thing is ,  the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie ,  but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus ,  and the cluster doesn't NOT_take NOT_up NOT_much NOT_room NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sky NOT_at NOT_all .  these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment .  be careful ,  for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and  .   .   .  oh ,  it has to be seen to be believed!<br /><br />starlight ,  star bright; last star i see tonight; i wish i might ,  i wish i may; not NOT_have NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_any NOT_more NOT_of NOT_this NOT_trash NOT_today . <br /><br />zantara's score: 1 out of 10 . 
1363 1 richard chamberlain is david burton ,  a tax lawyer living in sydney ,  australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in peter weir's apocalyptic 1977 thriller the last wave .  taking up where picnic at hanging rock left off ,  the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and ,  in the process ,  shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions .  weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been "domesticated" ,  their tribal laws and culture no NOT_longer NOT_apply .  <br /><br />from the start ,  burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and "dream time" evaporates .  water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to burton's discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps .  as violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky ,  the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear .  burton and his wife annie (olivia hamnet) study books about the aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions .  when he invites one of his clients chris lee (david gulpilil) to his home for dinner ,  he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by chris and his friend charlie (nadjiwarra amagula) ,  an enigmatic aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants .  as burton's investigation continues ,  his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder . <br /><br />after chris starts to appear in his dreams ,  burton is convinced that the aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because "he saw too much" ,  though chris refuses to acknowledge this in court .  burton ,  becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel ,  says to his stepfather priest ,  "why didn't NOT_you NOT_tell NOT_me NOT_there NOT_were NOT_mysteries?" NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_legitimate NOT_question NOT_but ,  according to the reverend ,  the church answers all mysteries .  burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves .  though we do not NOT_know NOT_for NOT_certain NOT_what NOT_is NOT_real NOT_and NOT_what NOT_is NOT_a NOT_dream ,  he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning . <br /><br />in this period of history in which native hopi and mayan prophecies predict the "end of history" and the purification of man leading to the fifth world ,  the last wave ,  though 25 years old ,  is still timely .  the aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture ,  not NOT_one NOT_completely NOT_subjugated NOT_by NOT_the NOT_white NOT_man ,  yet i am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not NOT_quite NOT_seeing .  weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality ,  but he perpetuates the doom-orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear ,  showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time . 
1364 0 please note: i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film .  i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky .  considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing ,  my review must be read with this in mind . <br /><br />although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well ,  this is in many ways a technically poorly made film .  while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 ,  up through the early to almost the mid-30s ,  a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films--with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film .  the lip movements in many ,  and in particular this film ,  don't NOT_even NOT_come NOT_close NOT_to NOT_matching NOT_what NOT_is NOT_being NOT_said NOT_and NOT_this NOT_would NOT_explain NOT_why NOT_an NOT_american NOT_like NOT_ms .  brooks could do a french film .  this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting . <br /><br />the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot .  for a silent morality play circa 1920 ,  it would have been fine ,  but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means "old"--not "slutty") .  a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancã© can't NOT_handle NOT_it .  she gives it all up ,  temporarily ,  but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! a tad melodramatic ,  huh? and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . <br /><br />finally ,  the character of the fiancã©'s friend(?) i found very disturbing and unreal .  he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else .  as he just took it throughout the movie and no NOT_resolution NOT_came NOT_about ,  his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited .  were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? this seems to me that's what is implied and i don't NOT_like NOT_it NOT_at NOT_all . <br /><br />there are far better french films of the era (le million ,  la femme du boulanger ,  fanny ,  regain ,  and others) as well as better silent films .  i just can't NOT_understand NOT_this NOT_film's NOT_high NOT_rating . 
1365 1 this is one of my all-time favorite films ,  and while it may move too slowly for some ,  it's well worth seeing .  a corporate lawyer (richard chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving "city" aborigines ,  and this is no NOT_ordinary NOT_case .  ok ,  a man has died but it wasn't NOT_exactly NOT_a NOT_normal NOT_killing .  there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately ,  and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive .  the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans .  this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about "city" vs .  "tribal" aborigines ,  and of course no NOT_abo NOT_in NOT_the NOT_big NOT_city NOT_would NOT_practice NOT_tribal NOT_ways .  uh huh .  chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening ,  although no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_many NOT_times NOT_i've NOT_seen NOT_this NOT_i NOT_can't NOT_quite NOT_grasp NOT_the NOT_exact NOT_connection .  this is a very eerie and creepy film ,  and is a fine example of peter weir's ability to create tension out of nothing .  the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally ,  it's the easiest way out and the scariest .  10 out of 10 and highly recommended .

1367 1 i like ghost stories .  good ghost stories of bumps in the night ,  voices that cannot be explained .  now i've see many of them .  as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films ,  some times to find a real gem  ,  you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories .  now this one ,  very rare  ,  pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called " the new house " was one of the most scariest films i ever saw .  it was on once in 1972 ,  .  .  . i was only 9 ,  .  . but nothing since then even compared to it .  with all the remake going on in hollywood ,  some one should do this one " as is " with no NOT_more NOT_special NOT_efx NOT_than NOT_the NOT_original .  this episode was down right creepy as hell .  i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find .  the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original " the haunting " and george c .  scott in " the changling "  .  wish someone would do more ghost stories like these . 
1368 0 couldn't believe it! clipped sentences? good grief! know what? all true! real people ever talk like this? don't NOT_think NOT_so .  good girl! stout fellow! stiffen upper lip! only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 gary cooper such a dish .  movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights .  seemed endless ,  anyway .  think all franchot tone's dialogue dubbed .  when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish .  handy tip - we brits clip words ,  not NOT_sentences .  and somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time .  but that's only if we've been to a really good public (that's private to you) school . 
1369 1 i grew up watching this series .  i was about seven/eight years old when it was on .  i still remember the 1st episode which was called "the new house . " it scared the h*ll out of me! i can almost still hear that statue ,  laughing madly .  and the ending ,  oh my god! the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: yikes! this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series .  i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually .  my question to any readers: has anyone purchased this set? its a bootleg .  both sellers claim to have very good copy .  i have a sketchy and poor dvd of "the new house" episode ,  and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better , however ,  if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids .  a great series ,  clever ,  scary and daringly supernatural .  thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- in fact ,  i'd love to discuss it .  chris walker 
1370 0 my wife and i thought that with this cast and director ,  the movie would have to be at least worth watching .  we were wrong .  in fact ,  we gave up on it after 45 minutes .  the idea that crawford ,  young and tone are british but speak with american accents was ,  for me ,  impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is england when no NOT_one NOT_talks NOT_with NOT_a NOT_british NOT_accent .  there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone ,  and to echo a previous comment ,  the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous .  there is no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_care NOT_about NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters ,  which is why we threw in the towel halfway through .  i found it hard to believe that hawks directed this ,  as none of the actors spoke with the trademark hawksian rat-a-tat delivery .  so save your time ,  and skip this one . 
1371 1 ghost story , (the new house) is a terrific horror story .  this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies . the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot .  remember him from the early family series ,  family affair in the 1960s? this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors ,  and as the main characters in the story . i saw this recently , and i was so scared!if you are alone , i would not NOT_recommend NOT_that NOT_you NOT_watch NOT_this . this story is terrific , no NOT_gore NOT_or NOT_curse NOT_words ,  but very scary .  barbara parkins played the young bride .  david birney played her husband . both actors were very good in their parts . if you like scary ,  fun , terrifying ghost stories ,  then you will like this little gem .  i gave this a high rating . i highly recommend this story . 
1372 0 in what would be his first screenplay ,  based on his own short story "turn about , " william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty ,  sacrifice ,  and really strange relationships .  the story originally was about only the tone ,  young ,  and cooper characters ,  but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract ,  and faulkner obliged by creating a female role .  crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars' young and tone ,  leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch ("wuthering heights" performed in semaphore) .  seriously ,  the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james . <br /><br />the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes ,  with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as may be found in his "sanctuary , " and elsewhere) .  when young proposes to crawford ,  in tone's presence ,  in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another .  the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable ,  especially as they go off to their thelma & louise fate .  frankly ,  it's creepy . <br /><br />not as creepy to this new yorker ,  however ,  as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach ,  wellington ,  which crawford cheerfully catches (and which is shown gamboling over her hands--i had to turn away!) and young turns into a gladiator .  blech . <br /><br />that being said ,  there are some nice performances .  young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in cooper's fighter plane ,  and roscoe karns is delightful as cooper's flying buddy .  tone ,  despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue ,  has a nice moment ,  dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy young's fate .  crawford ,  stripped of meaningful dialogue as well ,  mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic ,  which is quite a balancing act for one role . <br /><br />the battle scenes--not surprisingly ,  for a howard hawks film--are the most exciting part of the entire picture .  but not NOT_enough .  as far as i'm concerned ,  this is 75 minutes of my life i'm never NOT_going NOT_to NOT_get NOT_back . 
1373 1 ghost story (the tv movie--1972) was the pilot for the nbc series .  the movie was well-written and well-acted and ,  i thought ,  when the 1972-73 tv season started ,  if the tv series is half as good as the movie ,  then nbc has a winner .  (i wish this film was available on video!!) the series was a colossal disappointment--even with william castle as exec .  producer .  if ,  however , you have a chance to see the original tv movie ,  ghost story ,  check it out .  you won't NOT_be NOT_disappointed . 
1374 0 i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard .  and ,  in addition to them ,  charles butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film ,  .  .  . so why didn't NOT_i NOT_particularly NOT_enjoy NOT_it?! NOT_well ,  despite a good cast ,  this is one of the poorest written and most clichã©d "a pictures" i have ever seen .  given the talent and money spent to make this film ,  it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was .  i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next--and i was always right! and this isn't NOT_because NOT_i NOT_am NOT_some NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_"movie NOT_savant" ,  but was because almost no NOT_imagination NOT_or NOT_effort NOT_went NOT_into NOT_it .  in fact ,  it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichã©s all strung together! also ,  i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet ,  true to convention ,  she came running to him in the end .  uggh! there is more suspense in a lassie film ("will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?") . <br /><br />despite the very ,  very tired and clichã©d script ,  there were a few positives about the film .  it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten ,  shaved or slept in days .  also ,  charles butterworth's "prattle" did provide a few mildly humorous moments .  but all this just wasn't NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_this NOT_film NOT_look NOT_any NOT_different NOT_than NOT_a NOT_"b NOT_movie" .  it's a shame ,  .  .  . it could have been so much better . 
1375 1 this is a very entertaining flick ,  considering the budget and its length .  the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty .  the acting was great (p'z to dom) and the cinematography was also very well done .  i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers ,  it will not NOT_disappoint NOT_you! 
1376 0 i've always liked fred macmurray ,  andâ—although her career was tragically cut shortâ—i think carole lombard is fun to watch .  pair these two major and attractive stars together ,  add top supporting players like jean dixon ,  anthony quinn ,  dorothy lamour and charles butterworth ,  give them a romantic script ,  team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you getâ…a mediocre movie experience . <br /><br />skid johnson (fred) and maggie (carole) "meet cute" during her visit to the panama canal ,  and spend the next few weeks falling in love .  skid's a great trumpeter ,  so he embarks on a musical career ,  which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall .  during his climb to musical stardom ,  he neglects maggie ,  who later inspires him to start over after he's hit rock bottom .  ah ,  yesâ…it's the true hollywood happy ending ,  which comes none too soon . <br /><br />stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success ,  but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it's difficult to watch at times .  the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever ,  and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york .  fred and carole try their best ,  but the tired script and s-l-o-w direction just don't NOT_give NOT_them NOT_a NOT_chance .  even the final scene ,  in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment ,  just doesn't NOT_ring NOT_true . <br /><br />this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard .  however ,  i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours . 
1377 1 i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed .  tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films .  if she could do what she did with the budget of this film ,  i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture .  kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold) ,  and to whoever composed the music .  the warped "row your boat" blew me away .  very creative film all around .  .  .  . i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i'd buy it in a second .  if you get the chance ,  you should definitely see this film . 
1378 0 what the  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  is this ? this must ,  without a doubt ,  be the biggest waste of film ,  settings and camera ever .  i know you can't NOT_set NOT_your NOT_expectations NOT_for NOT_an NOT_80's NOT_slasher NOT_high ,  but this is too stupid to be true .  i baught this film for 0 . 89$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back .  can you imagine who hard it stinks ?<br /><br />who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? well actually ,  you couldn't possible care less .  and why should you? the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't NOT_care .  they didn't NOT_try NOT_to NOT_create NOT_a NOT_tiny NOT_bit NOT_of NOT_tension .  the director ( stephen carpenter -- i guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors .  complete crap as well ,  but at least that one had eliza dushku .  this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga !!! ( who ?? ) yeah that's right ,  the melrose place chick .  her very memorable character dies about 15 min .  after the opening credits .  she's the second person to die .  the first victim dies directly in the first minute ,  but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? the rest of the actors .  .  . they don't NOT_deserve NOT_the NOT_term NOT_actors NOT_actually ,  are completely uninteresting .  you're hoping they die a quick and painful death .  .  . and not NOT_only NOT_their NOT_characters<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>my NOT_humble NOT_opinion NOT_= NOT_0 NOT_/ NOT_10 
1379 1 maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is ,  i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job .  to do what she did with no NOT_budget .  .  . wow ,  thats all i can say .  really ,  really good .  like no NOT_money NOT_was NOT_spent NOT_on NOT_this NOT_film NOT_and NOT_it NOT_still NOT_blew NOT_me NOT_away .  i definitley suggest checking it out if you can .  great directing ,  fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse .  see it . 
1380 0 if you've ever seen an eighties slasher ,  there isn't NOT_much NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_one .  originality often isn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_slasher NOT_cinema's NOT_strongpoints ,  and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in .  there really isn't NOT_much NOT_that NOT_can NOT_said NOT_about NOT_pranks ,  so i'll make this quick .  the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list ,  and that was my only reason for seeing it .  the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time .  as they're in a slasher ,  someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie .  the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because ,  despite a few gory scenes ,  this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone ,  and gorier slashers than this (friday the 13th ,  for example) didn't NOT_end NOT_up NOT_banned .  but then again ,  there's banned films that are much less gory than this one (the witch who came from the sea ,  for example) .  anyway ,  the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it ,  as although the audience really couldn't care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done .  on the whole ,  this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss .

1383 1 i'll come clean .  the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine .  when i heard the title of the film ,  i thought it was going to be .  .  . different ,  perhaps in not NOT_such NOT_a NOT_good NOT_way . <br /><br />but i was wrong .  after reading what few reviews were out there about this short ,  i was actually excited about seeing it .  i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later .  needless to say ,  i was not NOT_disappointed . <br /><br />the film follows jack ,  a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality ,  and what is all in his head .  i won't NOT_give NOT_away NOT_what NOT_happens ,  but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism . <br /><br />the directing is fantastic ,  focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments . <br /><br />all in all ,  i give this great film 9 out of 10 ,  for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve . 
1384 0 one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties ,  pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga (the sure thing ,  the fly 2); her character dies fairly early on ,  and the rest of the film is totally forgettable . <br /><br />during their christmas break ,  a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture .  a crazy killer ,  however ,  throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways . <br /><br />exploiting every stalk 'n' slash clichã© in the book ,  director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed ,  so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile .  the majority of the deaths (which ,  let's face it ,  is why we generally watch this kind of film) are brief and not NOT_that NOT_gory; NOT_the NOT_only NOT_truly NOT_grisly NOT_imagery NOT_comes NOT_right NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_when NOT_the NOT_bodies NOT_of NOT_the NOT_victims NOT_are NOT_discovered NOT_by NOT_the NOT_remaining NOT_survivor NOT_(there NOT_is NOT_one NOT_notably NOT_bloody NOT_dismembered NOT_corpseâ—the NOT_film NOT_could've NOT_done NOT_with NOT_more) . <br /><br />at the last minute ,  the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending ,  but this really is one for slasher completists only . 
1385 1 i first saw this movie at a festival .  there were many good movies ,  but few kept me thinking about it long after ,  and an insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them .  tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker .  the shots were great .  casting was perfect .  dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted .  there wasn't NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_to NOT_know NOT_about NOT_his NOT_character ,  but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him .  and ellen-- i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_where NOT_she NOT_ends NOT_up!

1386 0 ((nb: spoiler warning ,  such as it is!))<br /><br />first off ,  this is a teen slasher flick -- the spam-in-a-cabin genre ,  as joe bob briggs piquantly put it .  if you're looking for roshambo ,  this isn't NOT_it NOT_and NOT_wasn't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_it .  i'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography ,  directing or acting performances . <br /><br />secondly ,  this wasn't NOT_zuniga's NOT_first NOT_horror NOT_flick ,  it was her first screen appearance period ,  cinema ,  tv ,  whatever .  for what it is worth; neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn . <br /><br />thirdly ,  you have to give even a lame slasher flick props .  sure ,  it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof ,  and the harvest time is now . <br /><br />except this one gives the chop to the sweet ,  virginal protagonist as well! now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role .  another one hit wonder ,  except that term gives the lass too much credit . <br /><br />(then again ,  this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history .  of the nineteen credited actors ,  a whopping thirteen never NOT_appeared NOT_in NOT_any NOT_other NOT_film .  three appeared in one other movie by the same producers .  only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits .  what was this ,  the has been and never NOT_were NOT_mutual NOT_aid NOT_society?)<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>granted ,  i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never NOT_anticipate NOT_being NOT_that NOT_bored NOT_in NOT_my NOT_life NOT_again ,  but i see no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_hunt NOT_down NOT_everyone NOT_involved NOT_and NOT_toss NOT_them NOT_in NOT_the NOT_incinerator NOT_with NOT_joanne . <br /><br />2/10 . 
1387 1 this is an almost action-less film following jack ,  an insomniac ,  as he goes through hallucinations ,  is visited by dead friends ,  throws himself off a building ,  and ,  for a lot of the time ,  can't NOT_tell NOT_reality NOT_from NOT_hallucination . <br /><br />dominic monaghan ,  as jack ,  is truly believable .  confused ,  and scared but lethargic and ,  at times blankly accepting of what he sees ,  we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep . <br /><br />introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children that suddenly appear in jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting ,  mind boggling ,  43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more . 
1388 0 it's the early 80s .  there's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens .  and there's a maniac stalking around .  yes ,  this is slasherville . <br /><br />this movie is called pranks .  why is it called pranks? i haven't the faintest idea .  unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance ,  not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_prank; NOT_in NOT_fact NOT_quite NOT_a NOT_rubbish NOT_prank NOT_if NOT_truth NOT_be NOT_told .  but there you go . <br /><br />the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory .  they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose .  to combat this development ,  they split up and wander about in the dark .  it ends in tears for most of them . <br /><br />pranks is a badly made slasher movie .  the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one .  it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence .  this makes the dvd even more pointless because ,  let's face it ,  a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time .  for slasher-film and video nasty completists only . 
1389 1 an insomniac's nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity .  having chronic insomnia ,  jack is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't . <br /><br />we find out interesting things about jack near the end ,  and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a "happily ever after" hollywood ending .  wrong .  this is new york city ,  the place where nobody sleeps . <br /><br />tess nanavati (writer and director) has herself a good film in 'an insomniac's nightmare' .  a talented filmmaker and writer (she made this film right after her high school graduation) ,  she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future . <br /><br />as i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable; between the music ,  bleak scenery ,  and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan (as jack) ,  i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it . 
1390 0 i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see .  well ,  i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as "april fools day" ,  "friday 13th" and "prom night" ,  this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story .  characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer .  another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket ,  he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting ,  instead ,  the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste ,  i was disappointed in his part in the end .  as far as the true identity of the killer goes ,  when the identity was released as to who he was ,  i just laughed ,  but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed .  this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't NOT_spend NOT_your NOT_hard NOT_earned NOT_money NOT_on NOT_it NOT_in NOT_some NOT_rare NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_find NOT_collectors NOT_inventory . 
1391 1 this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen .  the writer/director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you .  insomniac's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen .  is it a dream or reality? this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious .  it has an eery feel with it's dark interpretations of illusions .  dominic monaghan really became the insomniac .  he is a great actor who is not NOT_hard NOT_on NOT_the NOT_eyes NOT_either! NOT_he NOT_really NOT_poured NOT_his NOT_whole NOT_being NOT_into NOT_this NOT_role .  from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites .  i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative ,  creative writer/director/cinematographer!!! 
1392 0 eh ,  not NOT_a NOT_particular NOT_good NOT_slasher NOT_flick .  so-so acting ,  effects ,  decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack . <br /><br />there are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes .  apart from that ,  there's a lot of characters wandering around ,  not NOT_realizing NOT_what's NOT_going NOT_on ,  or chasing after red herrings; more killing of time ,  than of people .  there are other deaths ,  and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer ,  not NOT_partial NOT_to NOT_any NOT_one NOT_implement .  the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well .  the identity isn't NOT_revealed NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_end ,  and motive is pretty thin ,  and we really don't NOT_care . <br /><br />supposedly the movie takes place around christmas ,  but this isn't NOT_a NOT_major NOT_factor .  one scene gets lit by christmas lights ,  that's about it . <br /><br />the movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time ,  at least on the videotape i watched .  some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes .  the ending should have been stronger than it was .  we think we realize what happened ,  although there's a chance something else did . 
1393 1 surprisingly well done for an independent film ,  an insomniac's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia .  wonderfully well written ,  and directed ,  it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac . <br /><br />starring dominic monaghan as jack ,  we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on .  the narration is almost hypnotizing ,  and from the opening lines ,  it is impossible to turn away .  fascinating and slightly disturbing ,  it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep ,  balancing on the brink between sanity and madness . <br /><br />with twists and turns around every corner ,  an insomniac's nightmare is provocative and engaging .  it comes very highly recommended . 
1394 0 the two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities . <br /><br />first ,  daphne zuniga ,  in her first appearance in a film ,  young and supple ,  with looks that still encompass her body today ,  steals the very beginning ,  which is all she is in ,  and that is that .  she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects . <br /><br />second ,  the score by then known composer christopher(chris) young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star .  .  . yeah ,  i know one star more is not NOT_much ,  but in this movie's case ,  it is a lot . <br /><br />the rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down ,  getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer ,  blah ,  blah ,  blah .  .  . we all know where this is going . <br /><br />watch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga ,  then turn it off . 
1395 1 this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen .  for such a very low budget ,  it was done well; as an insomniac myself ,  i can sympathize with the main character ,  although my sleeping problems have never NOT_been NOT_as NOT_intense NOT_or NOT_as NOT_disturbing .  <br /><br />well directed ,  well acted ,  of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters ,  lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting .  there are few noticeable goofs ,  but they may be intended; you'll see after you watch the movie .  the movie is very personal ,  and worth watching twice .  no NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_flawless ,  but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better .  all in all ,  8/10 . 
1396 0 an uninteresting addition to the stalk 'n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980's .  this was filmed as pranks but released as the dorm that dripped blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology the house that dripped blood .  daphne zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie (she has also appeared in the initiation and the fly ii) . 
1397 1 i have seen this movie a while back ,  after ordering it for my friend ,  who is a big dominic monaghan fan .  the movie itself was very interesting ,  though it had its positive points ,  which for me was the donnie darko kind of "wtf?" factor after the movie had ended . <br /><br />of course ,  with positive also come negative points .  to me ,  the young girl in the film was incredibly good ,  and dominic monaghan did a good job as well .  unfortunately i don't NOT_have NOT_this NOT_opinion NOT_about NOT_daniel NOT_burke ,  who played lonnie .  this might just be me ,  and i'm not NOT_claiming NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_critic ,  in the way that i don't NOT_find NOT_myself NOT_skilled NOT_enough ,  but he just didn't NOT_seem NOT_convincing NOT_as NOT_an NOT_actor .  but perhaps it's even more striking then ,  for although i am not NOT_a NOT_critic ,  this does get my attention . <br /><br />to conclude ,  over all i think it's definitely a film worth watching .  it's interesting ,  confusing ,  and you just should have seen it . 
1398 0 probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever ,  badly acted and badly written . <br /><br />the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm ,  but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one ,  the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll ,  or could it be one of the five characters . <br /><br />acting not NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_not NOT_that NOT_great NOT_either NOT_apart NOT_from NOT_daphne NOT_zungia NOT_who NOT_dies NOT_way NOT_too NOT_quickly NOT_and NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_the NOT_main NOT_heroine ,  and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end . <br /><br />the kills can't NOT_really NOT_see NOT_why NOT_they NOT_banned NOT_this ,  the kills look fake mostly ,  one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake ,  but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car ,  one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive . <br /><br />overall not NOT_really NOT_a NOT_great NOT_slasher NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_better 
1399 1 i saw insomniac's nightmare not NOT_to NOT_long NOT_ago NOT_for NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time NOT_and NOT_i NOT_have NOT_to NOT_say ,  i really found it to be quite good .  if you are a fan of dominic monaghan you will love it .  the hole movie takes place inside his mind -or does it? the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end .  the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film ,  if not NOT_greater NOT_for NOT_those NOT_dom NOT_fans .  it has tons of candid moments from the set ,  outtakes and a great interview with the director .  anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess (the director) ,  dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film .  it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection . 
1400 0 i'm not NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_quality; NOT_i'm NOT_just NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_get NOT_through NOT_the NOT_74 NOT_famous NOT_video NOT_nasties NOT_that NOT_were NOT_banned NOT_in NOT_britain .  this one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut . <br /><br />some college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation .  there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids .  which of them is the slasher? the actual killings are not NOT_very NOT_gory ,  so this video nastie is not NOT_really NOT_nasty .  there is the requisite flashing of the boobies ,  but it has nothing to do with the college kids . <br /><br />i had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right .  maybe i've seen too many of these .  the end twist was clever; i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality . 
1401 1 an insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting ,  well-made film .  i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer .  .  . the acting was top notch - honestly ,  i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else ,  especially the young girl ,  was great as well .  i was very impressed by the look of the film ,  too .  usually ,  "independent films" have a grainy ,  i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them ,  but this director knows what she's doing .  the lighting ,  the cinematography .  .  . quality work .  i'm looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati! 
1402 0 over christmas break ,  a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings .  to make the work a bit more difficult ,  a murderous ,  chucks-wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm ,  preying on the group in various violent ways . <br /><br />registered as one of the 74 'video nasties' listed by the u . k .  in the 1980s ,  the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing .  the term 'video nasty' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore ,  violence ,  sex ,  etc . : all the things a horror fan dreams of .  so ,  after hearing all of that info ,  i settled into pranks (alt .  title) expecting a sleazy slasher experience .   .   .  and that's what it tried to be ,  but failed pretty much completely .  visually ,  the film's not NOT_great .  the cinematography ,  gore (except for a couple scenes) ,  and overall direction all fail .  it's simply not NOT_enjoyable NOT_to NOT_watch .  the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason (like the opening kill) .  there are some cool death scenes ,  including a pretty nice face melt (which can be seen on the poster) ,  but that's about it for the positive .  the acting is pretty bad ,  the story seems unimportant ,  the killer isn't NOT_cool NOT_or NOT_scary ,  and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid: it's a bit boring .  overall ,  for a film done by a few ucla film students for $90 , 000 (which would be over double that today) ,  the dorm that dripped blood isn't NOT_a NOT_total NOT_mess .  it has a couple good things ,  and is fairly watchable .   .   .  but ,  as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces .   .   .  it just cannot compare .  don't NOT_expect NOT_much ,  and you may at least be entertained .  i hate to say it ,  but this is one of the few films i've seen that would actually be better with a remake .   .   .  and yet ,  they go after great works like black christmas .  oh well .   .   . <br /><br />obligatory horror elements:<br /><br />- subgenre: slasher<br /><br />- violence/gore: there are some brutally cool kills ,  and the gore is okay for the most part .   .   .  but nothing special .  also ,  they off-screened some of the best murders . <br /><br />- sex/nudity: there's a little unappealing (to me) nudity ,  but not NOT_very NOT_much . <br /><br />- cool killer(s): nah .  the ending monologue(s) of the killer made him/her pretty uncool . <br /><br />- scares/suspense: a jump scare or two ,  but nothing too effective . <br /><br />- mystery: i suppose ,  yeah ,  but i simply didn't NOT_care NOT_enough ,  and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face . <br /><br />- - -<br /><br />final verdict: 3 . 75/10 .  bah! humbug! <br /><br />-ap3-

1404 0 daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher ,  and the light fades quickly .  if not NOT_her ,  than what other reason to watch this .  five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition .  problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting ,  and the group are short a few people .  then ,  a killer is on the loose .  i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one .  it had a fair set up ,  or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it .  the film is too slow ,  and almost as silent as a library .  most of the acting is below average ,  and the "point-of-view" moments are so old news .  acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as "hellraiser" and "entrapment" scored this ,  in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie .  still ,  it seems higher than the movie deserves .  so ,  other than young and zuniga ,  this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel . 
1405 1 this film is one of the best shorts i've ever seen - and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals ,  i've seen a lot ,  especially of what the industry considers "the best . " i'm not NOT_a NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_monaghan .  his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me ,  his only decent performance being in lost ,  so i generally try to avoid his films .  i did ,  however ,  happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed .  this director really knows what she's doing .  of course ,  you are going to get the trolls (or just ignorant people) who don't NOT_understand NOT_what NOT_constitutes NOT_a NOT_good NOT_film NOT_and NOT_rip NOT_on NOT_low NOT_budget NOT_work NOT_because NOT_they NOT_have NOT_no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_went NOT_into NOT_it .  but luckily ,  from what i've seen ,  they are in the minority when it comes to this gem . <br /><br />let's not NOT_deny NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film NOT_was NOT_working NOT_on NOT_no NOT_budget ,  and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work ,  because that's certainly true .  the production value is very low ,  but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school? pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't NOT_matter .  if you take away a bit of the acting ,  the sound quality (which actually wasn't NOT_the NOT_fault NOT_of NOT_the NOT_filmmaker; NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_this NOT_at NOT_a NOT_festival NOT_and NOT_the NOT_sound NOT_was NOT_fine .  .  . i guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up) ,  and the fact it was shot on mini-dv ,  then what are you left with? the story ,  the visual composition and the soul of the film ,  which are indisputably flawless . <br /><br />nanavati can tell a story .  that much is clear .  she can write substance-heavy ,  engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood ,  create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story ,  and bring it to life in a fascinating ,  creative way that ,  were this higher budget ,  might have won awards .  give it more experienced actors ,  better sound post-production ,  and 35mm instead of mini-dv and even the trolls couldn't complain .  this girl is incredible ,  and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago ,  she's done some amazing work since .  the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that ,  and i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_higher NOT_budget NOT_stuff NOT_she's NOT_done .  9/10 stars ,  this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker . 
1406 0 college students ,  who are clearing out a condemned dormitory ,  are stalked by an elusive killer . <br /><br />the dorm that dripped blood (aka pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans .  the movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine ,  there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring .  in fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable ,  save for one or two brutal murders .  but the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold ,  unconventional conclusion . <br /><br />the cast is lackluster for the most part .  stephen sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character .  also look for a young daphne zuniga as an ill-fated student . <br /><br />over all this is a pretty standard b slasher effort ,  but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum . <br /><br />** out of **** 
1407 1 i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera .  it's no NOT_epic NOT_but NOT_it's NOT_plenty NOT_engaging NOT_and NOT_i NOT_was NOT_never NOT_bored .  if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse ,  then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens .  i know i'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release .  damn good job ,  and well worth the money .  what a script! it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i've seen lately .  nanavati knows how to tell a story ,  both in writing and on screen .  serious kudos to her ,  can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_more . 
1408 0 a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege .  ooh .  does that whet your appetite? well ,  then ,  belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history .  for good measure ,  it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice .  the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog .  most of acting is amateurish .  the production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors ,  all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market (jasmine guy ,  ben vereen ,  pam grier ,  eartha kitt) ,  including some faces that have barely been seen at all (bianca lawson ,  rachel cuttrell) .  it also is ,  despite itself ,  a sterling showcase for nicole lyn .  the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is on-hand as well .  so ,  is the late ossie davis ,  a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company .  this film should be rated "t" for tripe . 
1409 1 this film ,  as low budget as it may be ,  is one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen .  if you accept that it's low budget from the start ,  you can appreciate just how good of a story it is ,  how very well written the script is ,  and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money . <br /><br />all the elements of a great film are here .  the visuals ,  though shot on digital ,  were gorgeous in places .  the bizarre ,  dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog ,  that scene was just amazing .  it's such a trippy piece of work ,  but not NOT_done NOT_in NOT_a NOT_pretentious NOT_way ,  and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film .  it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating ,  and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there . 
1410 0 there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no NOT_sense .  some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all ,  and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no NOT_reason NOT_for NOT_their NOT_existence . <br /><br />where's the relationship between christophe and marcel? where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet? why does dolly rose appear at all ,  since her story's never NOT_explained? NOT_where's NOT_the NOT_rape NOT_and NOT_redemption NOT_of NOT_marie ,  whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to richard? why does the film end with marcel's beating at the hands of his father? we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no NOT_backstory NOT_explaining NOT_this NOT_hatred? NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>as NOT_for NOT_the NOT_performances ,  there's not NOT_a NOT_one NOT_that's NOT_better NOT_than NOT_mediocre ,  though that's likely due to the lousy script .  best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard--but richard's not NOT_on NOT_screen NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_salvage NOT_the NOT_film .  worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose ,  though again ,  it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with . <br /><br />all in all ,  this is just terrible .  i thought it'd be impossible for any anne rice book-turned film to be worse than exit to eden ,  but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit .  how is it that rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen? 
1411 1 i came across an insomniac's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films ,  and glad to say it did not NOT_disappoint .  this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through ,  and the ending was excellent - one of those nooooo moments that really stays with you .  i've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down .  the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show .  she creeped the heck out of me ,  i can say that much .  nanavati did a great job putting this short together .  all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script .  so well written .  it's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film .  the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable ,  but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay .  good job to this girl ,  i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_more! 
1412 0 the story and the show were good ,  but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies .  ri'chard is great .  he really put on a top notch performance ,  and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous .  seriously ,  i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile .  i can't NOT_say NOT_anything NOT_bad NOT_about NOT_peter NOT_galleghar .  he's one of my favorite actors .  i love anne rice .  i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles ,  but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book .  this is a little too"real" for me .  i prefer lestat and louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves .  eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me; i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show .  (sorry for the ambiguity ,  but i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_give NOT_anything NOT_away) NOT_sorry ,  but it's just not NOT_my NOT_type NOT_of NOT_show . 
1413 1 i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time ,  and i was not NOT_disappointed .  the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic .  as a part insomniac myself ,  i can relate with how the story develops .  i have never NOT_experienced NOT_anything NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_but NOT_some NOT_awake NOT_moments NOT_overlap NOT_the NOT_sleeping NOT_and NOT_it NOT_can NOT_be NOT_scary .  it was a great film ,  worth every penny .  i hope that one day i can work with tess myself ,  it would be an honor and beyond .  i can recommend it for everybody .  maybe not NOT_small NOT_children NOT_as NOT_they NOT_may NOT_get NOT_scared .  but if you are an insomniac like me ,  you'll understand the world ,  the mysteries and the fear .  you'll love it .  <br /><br />f .

" while looking at someone off-screen .  she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day . <br /><br />even if the poor kid had any acting skills ,  the scene is completely unbelievable .  the little girl wouldn't NOT_even NOT_be NOT_in NOT_the NOT_middle NOT_of NOT_the NOT_battlefield NOT_after NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_carnage--surrounded NOT_by NOT_hundreds NOT_of NOT_dead NOT_bodies ,  while she calmly stands there!! natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified ,  running away from the bloody carnage! <br /><br />are we suppose to be horrified or laugh .  .  . ?!<br /><br />one particularly goofy detail ,  that gives the scene an snl satire tone ,  is the father hanging ,  with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek .  he looks like a fish on a hook! the unintentionally funny details ,  make the whole scene come across as fake and silly . <br /><br />in fantasy la-la-land ,  mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /><br />another funny detail ,  is that you see a central character--the little girl's mother--at the end of the scene and in the next scene ,  that occurs 20+ years later ,  she looks exactly the same! she is still young and beautiful ,  and now the same age as her daughter! <br /><br />i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful--but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors .  i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_these NOT_fine NOT_actors NOT_were NOT_thinking NOT_when NOT_they NOT_accepted NOT_these NOT_roles!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>who NOT_was NOT_the NOT_targeted NOT_audience?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>the NOT_excessive NOT_amount NOT_of NOT_blood NOT_and NOT_badly NOT_acted NOT_violence NOT_in NOT_the NOT_opening NOT_scene NOT_are NOT_weirdly NOT_out NOT_of NOT_place NOT_with NOT_the NOT_soap NOT_opera NOT_storytelling NOT_tone NOT_that NOT_follows .  it is also a strange way to start a movie that ,  for the rest of the time ,  seems targeted to romance novel reading females .  weird inconsistency in tone! 
1415 1 have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films ,  but i thought this one was very well done .  the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction .  the angles ,  settings ,  and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped .  many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director) . 
1416 0 the story and the show were good ,  but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies .  ri'chard is great .  he really put on a top notch performance ,  and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous .  seriously ,  i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile .  i can't NOT_say NOT_anything NOT_bad NOT_about NOT_peter NOT_galleghar .  he's one of my favorite actors .  i love anne rice .  i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles ,  but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book .  this is a little too"real" for me .  i prefer lestat and louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves .  eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me; i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show .  (sorry for the ambiguity ,  but i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_give NOT_anything NOT_away) NOT_sorry ,  but it's just not NOT_my NOT_type NOT_of NOT_show .

1418 0 this movie was so badly written ,  directed and acted that it beggars belief .  it should be remade with a better script ,  director and casting service .  the worst problem is the acting .  you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished ,  professional and totally believable ,  and on the other hand ,  ri'chard ,  who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece .  peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple ,  although both normally do fine work .  the actors (and director) should not NOT_have NOT_attempted NOT_to NOT_do NOT_accents NOT_at NOT_all--they NOT_are NOT_inconsistent NOT_and NOT_unbelievable .  much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english .  the casting is ludicrous .  why have children of an "african" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors ,  while the supposedly socially desirable marcel ,  has pronounced african features ,  including an obviously dyed blond "fro"? it's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color .  it's just so weird! this could be a great movie and should be re-made ,  but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors .  there are plenty of good actors out there ,  and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals ,  daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast ,  good script and decent direction .

1420 0 i read rice's novel with interest ,  and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths . <br /><br />however ,  i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation .  the casting was based merely on physical appearance ,  and not NOT_acting NOT_talent NOT_(with NOT_the NOT_obvious NOT_exception NOT_of NOT_peter NOT_gallagher ,  who was neither blond-haired ,  or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag) .  the cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious ,  but not NOT_in NOT_an NOT_entertaining NOT_way .  i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe ,  and was surprised i made it to the end . <br /><br />a warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one . 
1421 1 while i don't NOT_agree NOT_with NOT_bob's NOT_and NOT_tammy's NOT_decision NOT_to NOT_give NOT_up NOT_baby NOT_jesse ,  and it's something i'd never NOT_do ,  they were trying to do what was best for the baby .  the way this movie is written ,  you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe ,  from all different aspects .  patty duke? antagonist? almost unheard of ,  as far as i'm concerned .  but during the movie ,  she really convinces you that she's psychotic ,  or at least ,  that there's something seriously wrong with her .  her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed . " the movie seems to end quickly ,  leaving things somewhat unresolved .  but other than that ,  this movie is really great .  it really makes you think .  it's not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_when NOT_you NOT_just NOT_want NOT_to NOT_kick NOT_back NOT_and NOT_relax NOT_and NOT_watch NOT_something NOT_cute NOT_that'll NOT_make NOT_you NOT_laugh .  but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs ,  see things from others' perspectives ,  and discover a little something about yourself .  caution: you may even grow while watching this movie! and it's all worth it ,  in the end . 
1422 0 i'm not NOT_sure NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_spoiler; NOT_perhaps NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_public NOT_service .  if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits ,  you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice-over ,  which states the u . s .  has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7 ,  1945 to end wwii .  here are just a few of the problems with this close: <br /><br />1)the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion . <br /><br />2)the average person will really kick themselves that they did not NOT_"watch" NOT_one NOT_of NOT_these NOT_unholy NOT_fill-in-the-blanks NOT_flicks NOT_created NOT_in NOT_their NOT_own NOT_head NOT_for NOT_free ,  instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store (or on cable) . <br /><br />3)this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii ,  leading them to the conclusion that george w .  bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne . 
1423 1 "rock 'n' roll high school" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick .  portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (mary woronov ,  of "eating raoul" fame) ,  the whole movie is a mile a minute .  it's basically a big excuse to have fun ,  and i'm sure that you will .  bullied freshmen? check .  a dorky music teacher (paul bartel ,  also from "eating raoul"*)? check .  exploding mice? checkmate . <br /><br />anyway ,  this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living .  even for someone like me who doesn't NOT_know NOT_the NOT_ramones' NOT_music ,  it's pure pleasure .  with roger corman executive producing and joe dante co-directing ,  how could we expect anything less? too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as "caddyshack ii" . <br /><br />also starring p . j .  soles ,  vincent van patten ,  clint howard ,  dey young ,  dick miller (who has appeared in every one of joe dante's movies ,  and many of roger corman's) ,  don steele ,  and of course the ramones .  a real treat . <br /><br />*it seems like bartel and woronov always co-starred .  they also co-starred in joe dante's "hollywood boulevard" and the slasher flick "chopping mall" (also starring dick miller) .  .  . in which they reprised their roles from "eating raoul" . 
1424 0 when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy ,  xander ,  and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies .  now a weird movie i can stand ,  given that it's a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies ,  twin peaks ,  lost highway etc .  and you sort of have to be in the mood for one .  this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no NOT_sense .  i mean come on people nazi's who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers? i was surprised they didn't NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_hollow NOT_earth NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_hitler NOT_flying NOT_saucers NOT_and NOT_lizard NOT_people .  maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense ,  but seriously i don't NOT_condone NOT_drugs NOT_like NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_condone NOT_this NOT_movie .  it should be burned ,  shredded and forgotten just so good ol' xander might get another acting job .  it wasn't NOT_his NOT_acting NOT_though ,  that was alright ,  but the script just didn't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_sense .  sorry . 
1425 1 i simply love this movie .  i also love the ramones ,  so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place .  there isn't NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_critical NOT_praise NOT_to NOT_give NOT_this NOT_film ,  either you like it or you don't .  i think it's a great cult movie . 
1426 0 can i please say first of all ,  that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it .  and my review? this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen . <br /><br />the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- nazis ,  occult ,  time travel ,  etc .  ,  but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together .  remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using 'idea balls'? did these manatees also write unholy? its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas ,  but had no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_to NOT_link NOT_them NOT_all NOT_together ,  and then to make things make even less sense ,  included a donnie darko-esquire time travel theme to the ending ,  messing up the chronology . <br /><br />i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie .  special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd .  the acting wasn't NOT_great ,  but in fairness i've seen worse .  i will praise the nazi paintings ,  they were creepy ,  but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic . <br /><br />i don't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_vendetta NOT_against NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_or NOT_anything ,  but to be honest ,  i'm not NOT_even NOT_into NOT_the NOT_horror NOT_genre .  but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama .  if this story had been well told ,  this would have been a good movie .  but it has been over hyped .  waaaaay over hyped . 
1427 1 this movie is awesome .  sort of .  it dosent really say much ,  or do much ,  but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is .  the high school is taken over by evil ms . togar that hates the one thing that all the students love ,  rock& roll .  riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show ,  and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle & the ramones .  this movie has everything ,  a bad script ,  questionable directing ,  bad actors(ie clint howard & p . j .  soles) ,  an awesome soundtrack , extreme campyness ,  these elements & much more come together to make this what it is , a classic . <br /><br />note - during the live ramones set ,  notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd .  neat-o . 
1428 0 this is a movie of tired ,  yet weirdly childish ,  clichã©s .  there's a nazi witch master performing sf-related experiments in the basement? oh please! <br /><br />aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear ,  the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright .  not NOT_having NOT_any NOT_expectations NOT_beforehand ,  i am left with: an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape-like face who doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_act .  said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death" . <br /><br />camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame . 
1429 1 even if you're not NOT_a NOT_big NOT_ramones NOT_fan ,  rock 'n' roll high school is *still* the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made .  why? because under all the campiness ,  it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel (and justifiably so) for the boring ,  stupid ,  fascist ,  establishment world of adults .  that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen .  "mine eyes have seen the glory of the .  .  . " rock 'n' roll!<br /><br /> 
1430 0 this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb .  nazis ,  occult  ,  government conspiracies .  i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves .  instead you get something quite different ,  more psychological ,  more something like from david lynch .  that was actually a plus .  but the way the story is told is just awful . <br /><br />part of the trouble is the casting .  andrienne barbeau's character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid .  she just doesn't NOT_do NOT_that NOT_well ,  even at her age ,  though she certainly tried .  the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy .  most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie ,  or at least acted like it ,  rather than simply being quirky .  the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter ,  siri baruc . <br /><br />another big part is the pacing .  it starts off very slowly .  so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off .  but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath .  but shortly afterward ,  it all becomes a jumbled mess .  some of this was on purpose ,  but much of it was just needlessly confusing ,  monotonous ,  and poorly focused . <br /><br />the real problem ,  is it's simply not NOT_a NOT_pleasant NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_watch .  it's slow ,  dull ,  none of the characters are likable .  overuse of imagery and sets .  some movies you see characters get tortured .  in this ,  it's the viewer that does .  it does have a few creepy moments ,  most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits ,  but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome . 
1431 1 all the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not NOT_for NOT_that NOT_irritating NOT_harpsichordist .  rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones .  how anyone can watch this and not NOT_get NOT_a NOT_kick NOT_out NOT_of NOT_joey NOT_ramone NOT_eating NOT_bean NOT_sprouts NOT_backstage NOT_in NOT_an NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_him NOT_in NOT_performing NOT_condition NOT_is NOT_obviously NOT_a NOT_wet NOT_blanket NOT_square NOT_daddy-o .  ms trogar ,  exploding white mice ,  the hall patrols .  .  . instant classics .  nevermind the riff randell character . <br /><br />if you don't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_ramones NOT_then NOT_you NOT_don't NOT_know NOT_rock NOT_and NOT_roll NOT_and NOT_you NOT_don't NOT_deserve NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_called NOT_rock NOT_and NOT_roll NOT_high NOT_school . 
1432 0 this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  there is absolutely no NOT_storyline ,  the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching .  in the whole movie fredi (oh my god what a funny name .  ha ha) doesn't NOT_ask NOT_himself NOT_once NOT_how NOT_he NOT_came NOT_from NOT_a NOT_plane NOT_to NOT_middle NOT_earth .  there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny .  e . g .  : gandalf is called almghandi ,  sam is called pupsi  .  .  .  and so on .  i didn't NOT_even NOT_smile NOT_once NOT_during NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_movie .  the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative .  if you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times) then this movie is perhaps for you .  another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door (don't ask why- don't NOT_ever NOT_ask NOT_"why" NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie) NOT_and NOT_the NOT_code NOT_word NOT_is NOT_(ha NOT_ha): NOT_dung .  so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie .  for everybody else: go to youtube and watch "lord of the weed": it's a lot ,  lot more fun . 
1433 1 hello .  this movie is .  .  .  .  .  .  . well .  .  .  .  .  .  . okay .  just kidding! its awesome! it's not NOT_a NOT_block NOT_buster NOT_smash NOT_hit .  it's not NOT_meant NOT_to NOT_be .  but its a big hit in my world .  and my sisters .  we are rockin' rollers .  go ramones!!!! this is a great movie .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  for me! 
1434 0 it was meant to be a parody on the lotr-trilogy .  but this was one of the most awful movies i've ever seen .  bad acting ,  bad screenplay ,  bad everything .  this is my personal opinion .  i don't NOT_doubt NOT_any NOT_second NOT_that NOT_there NOT_are NOT_people NOT_who'll NOT_like NOT_this NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_"humor" ,  but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers .  i'm working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: at the movies it was a nice (but no NOT_big NOT_at NOT_all) NOT_success NOT_during NOT_the NOT_first NOT_two NOT_weeks NOT_but NOT_then ,  when the reviews of those who have seen it were not NOT_too NOT_good ,  the movie dropped very fast .  in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore .  in the last ten years ,  the two worst movies i've seen are the ring thing and torque .  i can't NOT_decide NOT_which NOT_one NOT_was NOT_worse ,  but i'm happy that there a so many good movies so i don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_think NOT_too NOT_much NOT_on NOT_this NOT_question . 
1435 1 huge ramones fan .  i do like the ramones ,  and i suppose if you hate them ,  then ,  besides being a avid bush supporter ,  you might not NOT_like NOT_this NOT_classic . <br /><br />it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's .  infinitely better than the american pie's that plague us now . <br /><br />there are some other great high school films: switchblade sisters ,  fast times .  .  .  ,  class of '84 ,  three o'clock high ,  and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) river's edge .  but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun ,  plus you can get up and dance with it . <br /><br />i love you ,  riff randell . <br /><br />10/10 
1436 0 the main reason people still care about "carlton-browne of the f . o . " is that it features peter sellers in a second-billed role .  but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake . <br /><br />sellers plays amphibulos ,  a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt-poor island nation of gaillardia ,  formerly a british colony ,  now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war .  amphibulos wants to play both u . k .  and soviet interests against each other for easy profit ,  "everything very friendly and all our cards under the table" .  terry-thomas is the title character ,  a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasn't forgotten them ,  all appearances to the contrary . <br /><br />a positive review here says: "the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated . " i would argue that the reason "carlton-browne" is considered below average is because the comedy is non-existent . <br /><br />after a decent opening that establishes the film's only two strengths ,  a sympathetically doltish terry-thomas and john addison's full-on larky score ,  things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes .  the low opinion of carlton-browne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia (which no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_find NOT_on NOT_a NOT_map) NOT_is NOT_milked NOT_to NOT_death .  by the time we actually reach the island (after a labored series of airsick jokes) ,  expectations are quite low . <br /><br />they're still too high ,  though .  the island itself ,  which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean ,  is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport ,  and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade .  the army is apparently still horse drawn ,  allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick-accented announcer: "in war ,  the army uses many horse . "<br /><br />sellers never NOT_quite NOT_takes NOT_center NOT_stage NOT_even NOT_when NOT_we're NOT_on NOT_his NOT_character's NOT_island .  the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris ,  who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his father's assassination .  bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written .  normally this would make him the likely target for scene-stealing by sellers ,  but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache ,  sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year ,  "the mouse that roared" and "i'm all right ,  jack . "<br /><br />strange that this film ,  like "jack" ,  was a boulting brothers production ,  with roy boulting here serving as co-director alongside jeffrey dell .  usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything-goes comedy ,  but here there are only fey jabs in either direction .  amphibulos works his mangled-english vibe for all its worth ("this man is like ,  how do you say ,  the bull in the chinese ship") while carlton-browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve . <br /><br />the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loris's romance with ilyena .  score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi ,  dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never NOT_addressed . <br /><br />the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no NOT_one ,  and a final bit of action by carlton-browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally .  apparently he lives to see another day ,  but the film of the same name is strictly doa . 
1437 1 rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made! i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones! you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols ,  or the clash in place of the ramones ,  it just wouldn't NOT_have NOT_been NOT_the NOT_same .  dey young ,  clint howard ,  vincent van patten ,  mary woronov ,  paul bartel ,  and the hall monters ,  just added to the movie .  the whole entire movie is about the ramones .  .  . especially joey! so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk .  not NOT_the NOT_sissy NOT_new NOT_crap .  .  . but the loud ,  and fast kind .  the kind only the ramones could do .  r . i . p (rest in peace) joey ramone 1951-2001 .  dee dee ramone 1952-2002! 
1438 0 this film ,  though ostensibly a comedy ,  is deadly serious .  its subject is imperialism (with a capital i): how britain ,  foolishly ,  humiliatingly ,  tries to convince itself that it's still a great power after world war ii .  at home ,  the empire is run by amiable dolts ,  benevolent tories who are so in-bred that they can't NOT_distinguish NOT_close NOT_relatives; NOT_the NOT_offices NOT_of NOT_government NOT_consist NOT_of NOT_long NOT_forgotten NOT_archives NOT_(a NOT_dig NOT_at NOT_orwellian NOT_paranoia?) ,  inhabited by indolent rats ,  and ante-rooms wherein lounge bored synacures ,  reading popular novels . <br /><br />abroad ,  britain clings to the old pomp; but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly ,  especially when its embodied in bumbling twits .  carlton-browne is an unsentimental picture of decline ,  with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti-imperialist jewel in the crown . <br /><br />the film is also about the cold war ,  bravely admitting that it's a dangerous farce ,  whose participants deserve mockery and contempt ,  not NOT_fear NOT_and NOT_respect .  it's about how colonialism ,  characterised more by neglect than tyranny ,  destroys the colonies it deserts ,  robbing them of amenities ,  power ,  and ,  most importantly ,  self-respect ,  leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys . <br /><br />it's the seriousness ,  of course ,  that kills it .  that's not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_weighty NOT_subjects NOT_can't NOT_be NOT_treated NOT_in NOT_comedy NOT_- NOT_the NOT_miracle NOT_of NOT_morgan's NOT_creek ,  dr .  strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that .  indeed ,  one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy - it allows for a clearer-eyed view . <br /><br />the problem with carlton-browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic ,  so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny .  in the three films mentioned above ,  much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation ,  not NOT_the NOT_extreme NOT_situation NOT_itself .  here ,  the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations ,  and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled - peter sellers ,  terry-thomas ,  raymond huntley and john le mesurier - are criminally wasted . <br /><br />terry-thomas ,  sublime so often ,  shows that he couldn't handle lead parts ,  and that he needed to play sneering ,  arrogant bounders ,  not NOT_brainless NOT_toffs .  the music is made to carry much of the comedy ,  but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen .  (to be fair ,  unlike the majority of british comedies of the period ,  which were stagy and underproduced ,  the boultings often try to make their points through film itself ,  by montage and composition) only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs ,  and that's by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep . <br /><br />none of the boultings' farces have dated well - they're never NOT_thought NOT_through NOT_enough .  although carlton-browne revels in the decline of the empire ,  it also seems to be anti-democratic and militaristic .  i'm sure this wasn't NOT_intended ,  but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form . 
1439 1 though this movie is cheesiness at its best ,  it is pulled off perfectly .  this movie ,  without a doubt ,  has to be considered a modern classic .  there are basically two kinds of movies i like - movies with depth (chick flicks ,  if you must - i blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax .  this movie is a perfect example of the latter . <br /><br />a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release .  considering me to somewhat shallow ,  he said to me ,  "you've got to see this movie .  it's just your type of movie . " foregoing the insult ,  i started watching .  i know they mentioned the ramones a million times ,  but when you actually see them ,  i said ,  "hey ,  it is the ramones . " my friend replied ,  "i don't NOT_know NOT_they NOT_were NOT_a NOT_real NOT_band . " i had my moment of glory . <br /><br />this movie ,  though now somewhat dated ,  is a must see for ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter . 
1440 0 you may want to know up front that i am not NOT_a NOT_mormon ,  unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film .  i mention this so you'll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith .  for some ,  being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith--and that is not NOT_my NOT_intention .  so ,  my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were .  well ,  after seeing the film ,  i doubt if i have learned much at all .  since i have been a history teacher ,  i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church .  but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh-darn nice--too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal .  plus ,  you learn practically nothing about the church's beliefs other than they are nice people ,  work hard and some have many wives (and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film) .  instead ,  the people are almost cartoon-like in their simplistic portrayals .  joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic ,  the non-mormons were all devils and brian donlevy (playing exactly the same sort of role edward g .  robinson later played in the ten commandments) is the trouble-maker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy .  it's all so very simple .  .  .  . too simple .  almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial . <br /><br />brigham young especially was a very complex man--with many good points (an excellent organizer and visionary) as well as bad (don't even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage) .  to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly .  it's also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsley--only the facts that led to his being almost super-human were emphasized .  heck ,  now that i think about that ,  this is the trouble with most religious films--they often come off as one-dimensional ,  trite and bland .  let's have a full and more complete film of these men--one that will stick to facts and not NOT_emotional NOT_appeals . <br /><br />now if you can ignore the fact that you won't NOT_learn NOT_very NOT_much NOT_about NOT_the NOT_faith NOT_or NOT_its NOT_second NOT_leader ,  the film is enjoyable enough .  it's obvious someone at 20th century-fox really cared about the film ,  as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors (tyrone power) ,  up and coming actors (linda darnell ,  jane darwell and vincent price) and wonderful character actors (dean jagger ,  john carradine and brian donlevy) .  the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss .  it just didn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_us NOT_other NOT_than NOT_they NOT_were NOT_all NOT_"swell" .  plus ,  there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes .  a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith (it was three years later) ,  no NOT_mention NOT_of NOT_the NOT_various NOT_mormon NOT_denominations NOT_and NOT_splinter NOT_groups ,  talk of "gold in california"--even though it was 1847 and gold wouldn't NOT_be NOT_discovered NOT_until NOT_1948 ,  as well as no NOT_specific NOT_mention NOT_of NOT_polygamy NOT_or NOT_smith's NOT_many NOT_wives .  just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene--and no NOT_one NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_care--even NOT_though NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_very NOT_hostile NOT_audience! NOT_don't NOT_you NOT_think NOT_at NOT_least NOT_the NOT_judge NOT_would NOT_tell NOT_him NOT_to NOT_put NOT_it NOT_away NOT_and NOT_stop NOT_threatening NOT_people NOT_with NOT_it?!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>one NOT_final NOT_comment .  do not ,  i repeat ,  do not NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_film NOT_when NOT_it's NOT_shown NOT_on NOT_american NOT_movie NOT_classics NOT_(a NOT_one NOT_great NOT_station NOT_that NOT_has NOT_sunk NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_in NOT_recent NOT_years) .  while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message ,  i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions .  what i mean is this .  the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop-ups (some advertising a show that features the "sexiest cast") .  talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film .  by doing this ,  they not NOT_only NOT_insult NOT_the NOT_faith NOT_but NOT_marginalize NOT_their NOT_market--after NOT_all ,  who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young?! is this a movie ,  in this form ,  that you can show to your kids or recommend to others?! 
1441 1 just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this: the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers .  "rock 'n' roll high school" is taking place in that world .  it's like a ramones record coming to life .  the characters are all as silly ,  innocent and charming as the ramones' songs ,  and the music itself is ,  of course ,  fantastic .  high school comedies have really changed over the years ,  if you compare a movie like "american pie" with this late 70's classic ,  where no NOT_tasteless NOT_sex NOT_jokes NOT_are NOT_made NOT_at NOT_all .  since a remake is apparently in the works ,  it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar ,  half-funny dick jokes ,  as bill hicks used to call them .  however ,  the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced .  they were the perfect band for this movie and no NOT_one NOT_else NOT_could NOT_even NOT_come NOT_close NOT_to NOT_taking NOT_their NOT_place .  so ,  the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone ,  as quirky and charming as it is .  gabba-gabba hey! 
1442 0 this film has got several key flaws .  the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! this sadly makes the film not NOT_only NOT_difficult NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_but NOT_also NOT_sends NOT_the NOT_watcher NOT_certain NOT_feelings NOT_of NOT_hopelessness ,  as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life .  this means that the film cannot captivate it's audience ,  instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! in short ,  it really is very very very very very very very bad! do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe ,  you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman . 
1443 1 rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones .  i was too young during the band's mid-70s heyday to be very aware of them ,  although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time .  i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid-80s when i was about fifteen years old ,  and laughed all the way through it .  (isn't it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up ,  all set to a rockin' soundtrack?) i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again ,  thinking "man ,  these guys kick ass! i have to check out some of their albums!" the rest is history .  twenty years ,  umpteen ramones lps/cassettes/cds ,  and three ramones shows later ,  they're still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it .  now that joey ,  dee dee and johnny have left us (r . i . p .  all)at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by . 
1444 0 one scene demonstrates the mentality of "terminator woman" pretty well: karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp .  karen runs across an armed guard ,  who points his gun at her ,  but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight .  karen kicks him in the balls ,  picks up the gun and runs away! then again ,  when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family ,  you know you shouldn't expect too much .  karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on ,  and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship .  but after about 20 minutes they get separated ,  and the film slows to a crawl ,  and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up ,  it lacks excitement .  the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat ,  but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value .  on the positive side ,  kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (*1/2) 
1445 1 one of b- and c-movie producer roger corman's greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle (originally designated for cheap trick) ,  rock n' roll high school .  it's just a simple ,  technically dated story (but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funny--see eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n' roll . <br /><br />students at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal ,  miss evelyn togar (played by cult classic favorite ,  mary woronov) who fears that rock n' roll turns kids into uncontrollable ,  amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n' roll-free zone .  actually ,  she intends to wipe out rock n' roll for all students ,  regardless of whether its at school ,  and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful . <br /><br />but not NOT_if NOT_riff NOT_randell NOT_(pj NOT_soles) NOT_can NOT_help NOT_it .  a ramones fanatic ,  she has written some songs (including rock n' roll high school) that she wants to give to the ramones ,  and in trying to do so ,  is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town .  it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adults and the teenagers (in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge ,  somewhat) .  after the years of punk ,  when the fame of garage rockers ,  the ramones (and others) would mark another shift in music evolution ,  it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous ,  exaggerated way . <br /><br />it is mostly mild comedy ,  but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you .  with jerry zucker (of airplane fame) and joe dante (of gremlins fame) both taking part in some of the directing ,  you can get the idea for what kind of humor you're in for (and not NOT_to NOT_mention ,  expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the film's finale) .  the story must've later inspired (and was consequently updated) by the mid-90s comedy ,  detroit rock city ,  which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers ,  kizz . <br /><br />i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle ,  rock n' roll high school forever ,  released nearly a decade later .  the original is still the best . 
1446 0 i just didn't NOT_get NOT_this NOT_movie .  .  . was it a musical? no .  . but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it .  .  . <br /><br />was it a serious drama .  .  .  . no NOT_the NOT_acting NOT_was NOT_not NOT_good NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_that . <br /><br />is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor .  . definently not . <br /><br />i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie .  the message on apartheid and the "tribute" to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted .  but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse . <br /><br />see for yourself ,  but in fairness i hated it 
1447 1 riff randell is a wildly ,  obsessed fan of the rock group; the ramones and so are most of the students in the school .  but a new tyrant of a principal ,  ms .  togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students ,  especially the music from the ramones .  so ,  when riff finds out they're performing in town ,  she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends .  but when ms .  togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets .  while ,  this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff ,  but riff's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom .  but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song . <br /><br />fun! fun! fun! yep ,  that's right 'rock n roll high school' doesn't NOT_drift NOT_away NOT_from NOT_it NOT_main NOT_focusâ… NOT_a NOT_boisterously ,  daggy romp! it wasn't NOT_what NOT_i NOT_was NOT_expecting ,  that's for sure .  everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit ,  which makes it a priceless experience .  that's not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_i NOT_think NOT_its NOT_art NOT_and NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_is NOT_as NOT_pointless NOT_as NOT_can NOT_be .  but watching this passionately ,  crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks ,  i just couldn't wipe the grin off my face .  it's tacky ,  very cheesy ,  densely chaotic ,  but damn it's funky-dory! <br /><br />this low-budget ,  b-grade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was co-writer ( and plus he co-directed some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot) .  is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichã©s and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults (who always know best) .  these features might not NOT_be NOT_particularly NOT_fresh ,  but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically ,  gusto treatment .  the film has just one thing on mind ,  to go out on a bang! and they manage to do that .  courtesy of 'the ramones' ,  who play themselves .  really ,  you could say its one big trendy video clip ,  since it's all about the ramonesâ… well ,  most of it anyway .  i see a lot flack towards the ramones' acting ability .  these are musicians not NOT_actors ,  which means it's not NOT_about NOT_their NOT_acting NOT_here ,  it's the music we're suppose to dig .  they're here to perform! which ,  they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe .  especially ,  their flamboyant concert performances .  the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo ,  the velvet underground ,  mc5 ,  fleetwood mack ,  eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper .  but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well .  especially in the scenes involving ms .  togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set .  the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it's sometimes clever ,  tongue-in-cheek dialogue .  thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags ,  which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself . <br /><br />what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles (better known for her performance in halloween) ,  who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell .  other exemplary performances were dey young ,  as the extremely cute kate rambeau ,  vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who's stupendously played by clint howard .  also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who's excellent as the demanding ms .  togar who's pushing her unfair reign on the students ,  paul bartel as mr .  mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end .  the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy ,  but that goes down well with the material and there's a certain likability stemming from these characters ,  but we totally despise ms .  togar and her hall monitor goons . <br /><br />there's no NOT_beating NOT_around NOT_the NOT_bush NOT_here NOT_when NOT_i NOT_say NOT_'rock NOT_'n' NOT_roll NOT_high NOT_school' NOT_is NOT_an NOT_intoxicating NOT_hoot ,  of a rad time! 
1448 0 the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one ,  that is aside from the musical perspective .  it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set .  the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never NOT_justifies NOT_such NOT_rapid NOT_shifts NOT_between NOT_jubilation NOT_and NOT_terror .  had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film ,  however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't NOT_exactly NOT_sit NOT_well NOT_next NOT_to NOT_the NOT_songs .  <br /><br />aside from the poor premise the acting isn't NOT_the NOT_best NOT_either ,  goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast .  overall a disappointment . <br /><br />3/10 
1449 1 the movie is just plain fun .  .  .  . maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "the ramones" around the time the film was made .  i've watched the film over and over ,  by myself and with friends ,  and it is still fresh and funny .  at the risk of being too serious ,  the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless ,  and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless . <br /><br />and ,  the film has some gem lines/scenes .  .  .  .  . references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life .  (let me assure you i've been out of high school for ,  uhhh ,  some years and it's not NOT_following NOT_me) .  .  .  .  . the famous "static" line ("i'm getting some static" .  .  .  .  . "not as much as you're going to get" ,  as principal togar approaches) .  .  .  .  . the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses .  .  .  . the nazi hall monitors love for a "body search"  .  .  .  .  .  . principal togar announcing ,  "i give you the final solution" ,  and burning the ramones records (note: records were what came before cd's)  .  .  .  . and of course joey ramone noting ,  "things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school" ,  followed by togar asking "do your parents know you're ramones?"<br /><br />just one piece of advice .  .  .  .  . don't NOT_look NOT_up NOT_where NOT_the NOT_stars NOT_are NOT_now .  .  .  .  . joey ramone sadly died young .  dey young ,  who was a major hottie in the film ,  today reminds us we all age .  .  .  . pj soles career never NOT_advanced NOT_as NOT_we NOT_might NOT_have NOT_expected .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  marla rosenfield ,  as one the other students ,  apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film) ,  though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles .  and ,  does anyone know what happened to dj don steele? <br /><br />so ,  watch and enjoy .  .  .  .  . don't NOT_think .  .  .  . just have fun! 
1450 0 this was an awful movie! not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_subject NOT_matter ,  but for the delivery .  i went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out) ,  expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression .  what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression ,  with no NOT_uplift NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end .  the previews and ads made no NOT_mention NOT_of NOT_this! NOT_plus ,  for all that they played up whoopi goldberg ,  my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! again ,  the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that ,  but it's just more of the problem) .  if i had known how depressing this movie would be ,  i would've never NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_it .  or at least ,  i would've been prepared for it .  this was a bait and switch ad campaign ,  and i will never NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_again!

NOT_not NOT_conventional NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way NOT_whatsoever ,  this film just let's loose a frenzy .  accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs ,  this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't NOT_dominate NOT_headlines NOT_and NOT_people NOT_just NOT_had NOT_a NOT_good NOT_time .  those ,  i guess were the days . 
1452 0 i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators .  to me it was rather a disappointment ,  especially the combination of historical facts ,  fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not NOT_work NOT_at NOT_all NOT_(in NOT_vonnegut's NOT_book NOT_slaughterhouse NOT_five NOT_and NOT_even NOT_in NOT_george NOT_roy NOT_hill's NOT_adaptation NOT_for NOT_the NOT_screen NOT_it NOT_does) .  credibility is often overstretched .  too many questions are left open .  did i miss some central points? or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? <br /><br />a boy called campbell ,  jr .  ,  grows up in upstate new york .  at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book .  it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it .  the boy leafs through the book ,  his dad doesn't NOT_like NOT_his NOT_doing NOT_that .  what should this tell me? the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin .  bang .  it is 1938 ,  the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright .  what kind of plays does he write? in what language? is he successful? his wife is an actress and looks glamorous .  the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same .  he does not .  why? because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american? because he is successful? because his wife is? because he likes his life there? because he likes the nazis? because he is just plain lazy and doesn't NOT_like NOT_change? NOT_don't NOT_ask NOT_me . <br /><br />possibly ,  the man just does not NOT_care ,  is not NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_politics ,  is a kind of an existentialist .  he states that he is deeply in love with his wife .  he speaks of his republic of two (meaning he and his wife) .  there is little to no NOT_evidence NOT_proving NOT_his NOT_love NOT_for NOT_his NOT_wife NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie ,  it much more seems a republic of one . <br /><br />on the request of an american agent campbell ,  jr .  ,  agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines .  the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short ,  unexciting and anti climactic ,  the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no NOT_explanation ,  the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast . <br /><br />so now we have campbell ,  jr .  ,  presenting himself over the air as the last free american .  the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when campbell ,  jr .  ,  really and honestly had to cough ,  hiccup etc .  (must have scrambled the messages terribly) .  anyway ,  the nazis lose ,  the wife dies (touring in the crimean for german troops - i never NOT_heard NOT_such NOT_tours NOT_really NOT_happened NOT_on NOT_german NOT_front NOT_lines NOT_in NOT_ww NOT_ii) ,  campbell ,  jr .  ,  says he goes to the russian front but does not NOT_go ,  is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?) ,  is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in auschwitz ,  is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york . <br /><br />and this is where the story really starts <br /><br />bang .  from now on it is like a short story by paul auster .  it is 1961 ,  campbell ,  jr .  ,  lives in new york tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife .  nobody really cares - or do they? yes ,  somehow they do ,  and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction .  auschwitz survivors .  a painter .  some american supremacists â„discover" him and want him to be their figurehead .  they even find his presumed dead wife for him ,  or is she his wife? anyway ,  in the end campbell ,  jr .  ,  calls in at the israeli consulate ,  and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment ,  placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann's .  he writes his life story and ,  once this task finished ,  hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit . <br /><br />while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss ,  i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone .  so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss .  amazingly ,  many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero ,  having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american .  i assume according to them this took a lot of courage .  as a matter of fact ,  however ,  the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win-win situation ,  as he would have been politically on the safe side no NOT_matter NOT_who NOT_had NOT_won NOT_the NOT_war .  the danger of his being uncovered never NOT_comes NOT_up NOT_during NOT_the NOT_first NOT_part NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story . <br /><br />one might argue ,  that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything .  but even then it fails to make a point ,  primarily ,  i suspect ,  because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat .  this is a pity ,  especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee ,  a talented ,  versatile and sensuous actress .  she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent .  another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts (confession ,  broadcast and hidden messages) ,  but i guess this is largely unfilmable .  maybe i should give the book a chance . 
1453 1 vince lombardi high school has a new principal--the evil ms .  togar (mary woronov) .  she intends to ban rock and roll music all together .  she butts head with riff randall (p . j .  soles) who loves the ramones .  also the head of the school football team (vincent van patten) can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_connect NOT_with NOT_any NOT_girl--not NOT_realizing NOT_cute NOT_kate NOT_rambeau NOT_(dey NOT_young) NOT_is NOT_in NOT_love NOT_with NOT_him . <br /><br />an instant midnight movie .  this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s .  i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in college--it was like a party! people were singing along with the songs ,  laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun . <br /><br />seeing it now as an adult i can't NOT_imagine NOT_why NOT_i NOT_loved NOT_this NOT_so NOT_much .  the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i couldn't believe i was hearing .  characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place .  what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov (who is really enjoying herself) .  also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top (as they should) .  as for the ramones .  .  . i was never NOT_a NOT_fan .  i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never NOT_really NOT_caught NOT_me .  if you're a ramones fan you might give this a higher rating . <br /><br />spoiler warning!!!! this is mostly for kids (it has a pg rating) who will probably find it silly but fun .  i especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! spoiler end!!!!<br /><br />so ,  if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this .  otherwise stay away .  i give it a 7 . 
1454 0 i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i've ever seen .  i did not NOT_laugh NOT_once NOT_throughout NOT_this NOT_short ,  and it's a bugs bunny cartoon ,  for christ's sake! bugs bunny cartoons are always funny ,  not NOT_boring! NOT_alas ,  this short turns out to be good night elmer (another incredibly boring jones short) with the addition of bugs bunny . <br /><br />the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no NOT_gag NOT_payoff .  good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff .  this cartoon ,  on the other hand ,  is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there's too much dialogue .  the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve ,  but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue .  at one point ,  elmer finishes eating dinner ,  and comments ,  "that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb , " possibly the most redundant dialogue i've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era woody woodpecker cartoons doesn't NOT_count NOT_in NOT_my NOT_book) .  even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long ,  it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this . <br /><br />elmer's pet rabbit was not NOT_a NOT_fun NOT_cartoon NOT_for NOT_me ,  but if you've sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career ,  you might enjoy it . 
1455 1 one of the best if not NOT_the NOT_best NOT_rock'n'roll NOT_movies NOT_ever .  and it's not NOT_just NOT_mindless NOT_fun .  there really were a lot of clever jokes in it .  of course i love the ramones .  but with all the "anarchy" and the "i hate high school" themes ,  the film doesn't NOT_at NOT_all NOT_take NOT_itself NOT_too NOT_seriously , which is what's great about it . <br /><br />i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 ,  and i saw it again recently .  since i went to high school in the late 1970's ,  it made me kind of nostalgic .  <br /><br />like i said ,  this film doesn't NOT_take NOT_itself NOT_that NOT_seriously NOT_and NOT_isn't NOT_pretentious NOT_like NOT_so NOT_much NOT_other NOT_teen NOT_fare NOT_of NOT_the NOT_seventies ,  eighties ,  and nineties .  and to speak of ,  it's not NOT_really NOT_dirty NOT_or NOT_disgusting NOT_either .  only pg rated .  that's rare for a movie in this category .  a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule . 
1456 0 i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked "buffet froid" from this director (bertrand blier) but the script of "les acteurs" is very poor .  why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario . 
1457 1 the ramones ,  whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock ,  lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan (p . j .  soles) who faces off against a merciless ,  joyless principal (mary woronov) for the right to rock . <br /><br />featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music ,  rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution .  it's chock full of riotous sight gags (like the mouse experiment) ,  teenage spirit (probably my all-time favorite film opening) ,  and bizarre ,  off-the-wall moments (the straitjacket scenes) .  if you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level ,  look no NOT_further .  but if you're looking for a nice ,  dignified ,  dramatic epic ,  maybe you should look a wee bit further . <br /><br />"hi everybody ,  i'm riff randell ,  and this is rock & roll high school!" 
1458 0 before starting to watch the show ,  i've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting .  what a deception ,  the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers .  and what about the sfx and colors ,  they are so extreme that it is painful to watch ,  colors are not NOT_saturated NOT_they NOT_are NOT_over NOT_saturated ,  like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated .  this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best ,  they are sufficient .  unfortunately for this show ,  the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility .

1461 1 i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell (played by p . j .  soles) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song "i want you around"  .  .  . very very cool stuff . <br /><br />it was fun ,  energetic ,  quirky and cool .  yes i'll admit that the ending is way-way over the top and far fetched  .  .  . but it doesn't NOT_matter NOT_because NOT_it NOT_is NOT_fun NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_very NOT_fun NOT_movie .  it's sex ,  pot and rock n rocll forever<br /><br />i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this  .  . but i do not NOT_know NOT_if NOT_this NOT_is NOT_true NOT_or NOT_not

1463 1 this movie is soooo funny!!! the acting is wonderful ,  the ramones are sexy ,  the jokes are subtle ,  and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his/her school .  i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism .  if you like monty python ,  you will love this film .  this movie is a tad bit "grease"esk (without all the annoying songs) .  the songs that are sung are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through .  this musical ranks number two in musicals to me (second next to the blues brothers) .  but please ,  do not NOT_think NOT_of NOT_it NOT_as NOT_a NOT_musical NOT_per NOT_say; NOT_seeing NOT_as NOT_how NOT_the NOT_songs NOT_are NOT_so NOT_likable ,  it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place .  i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance .  you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say ,  you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film .  highly recommended for both the family (since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience . 
1464 0 a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself .  20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't NOT_turn NOT_out NOT_like NOT_his NOT_father .  all the stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the "funny" guy; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses--that's how we know); the nerd and two no-personality blondes .  it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life (don't ask) and kills people .  i knew i was in trouble when ,  after a great opening scene ,  we jump to 20 years later--all bad horror movies do that!<br /><br />the dialogue is atrocious ,  the acting is bad (except for betsy palmer--why betsy?) and the killings are stupid and/or unimaginative .  my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed! a real bad ,  stupid incoherent horror film .  avoid at all costs . 
1465 1 well ,  i have finally caught up with "rock 'n' roll high school , " almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 .  (latecomer that i am ,  i will probably first see this summer's new documentary "patti smith: dream of life" sometime around 2040!) and no ,  the film doesn't NOT_feel NOT_dated NOT_one NOT_bit ,  and yes ,  it was worth the wait .  this is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments .  it tells the story of riff randell ,  adorably played by p . j .  soles ,  and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal ,  miss togar .  (danny peary ,  in his book "cult movies , " quite accurately describes mary woronov's performance as an "evil eve arden . ") a typical teens vs .  establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (those exploding mice ,  that giant mouse ,  the hansel and gretel hall monitors) and some truly rousing tunes .  riff is ,  of course ,  the #1 fan of that original punk band the ramones ,  and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film ,  including five at a concert that is a total blast .  indeed ,  the sight of riff furiously dancing to "teenage lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment .  and the initial appearance of joey ,  johnny ,  dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile ,  and later slinking down a street singing "i just wanna have something to do , " is quite exhilarating .  the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is ,  i would imagine ,  every high school kid's wet dream .  fun stuff indeed .  on a side note ,  the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert ,  so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired .  how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary ,  i wonder .  .  .  . 
1466 0 those of you who ,  like me ,  were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn ,  "the fear" will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel .  it sort of follows a similar plot ,  but it is impossible to connect to the original ,  with the exception of the presence of morty ,  the mannequin monster made of wood .  here is a brief overview . <br /><br />twenty years after mike hawthorne (gordon currie ,  in a decent performance) witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life ,  mike is still suffering from the fear of that day .  in hopes of ridding his fear ,  mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents' home .  his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears ,  and then present the fears to the mannequin morty .  according to an indian friend ,  this process is supposed to magically take away one's fear .  what mike doesn't NOT_know NOT_is NOT_that NOT_morty NOT_is NOT_possessed NOT_with NOT_his NOT_father's NOT_spirit ,  and begins killing off the friends .  .  . or is it really mike himself doing the killings? who cares?<br /><br />a have a few troubles with this film .  the first lies with morty .  i thought the original made morty look rather convincing .  this time ,  it is painfully obvious morty is a man (actor jon fedele) in a fake looking suit .  this can especially be seen in early scenes ,  where morty is still supposed to be inanimate ,  but if you watch closely you can see him blinking .  another trouble is that most of the characters don't NOT_try NOT_hard NOT_enough .  some of them do ,  namely betsy palmer ,  of friday the 13th fame ,  who was excellent in this film .  but most of them don't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_effort NOT_or NOT_weren't NOT_given NOT_the NOT_chance .  finally ,  there are the killings .  the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing .  actually ,  when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie .  when the second half of the movie arrives ,  and the killings really start ,  everything falls to pieces .  deaths are either uncreative ,  unseen ,  or foreseen (glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout) .  one character dies in the end and no NOT_one ,  including the viewer ,  even notices .  while more characterization was needed in the beginning half ,  it wasn't NOT_too NOT_bad .  the second half was .  i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_shoot NOT_the NOT_violent NOT_scenes ,  so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian .  a silly ending doesn't NOT_help NOT_either .  thus ,  unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin ,  you should probably skip "the fear 2: halloween night . " zanatos' score: 4 out of 10 . 
1467 1 how can you go wrong with the amazing ramones? what a crime that two of them are already dead .  it reminds me of the dennis leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever .  i'm paraphrasing here ,  but you get the idea . <br /><br />rock and roll high school tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration .  it's extremely silly stuff ,  but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building) .  who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? rock and roll high school is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society .  it's full of kids who know authority doesn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_correct NOT_answers .  rather ,  rock and roll is the only thing they can trust . <br /><br />but most important ,  this is pure exploitation . <br /><br />take none of it seriously .  just go in and have a good time .  if this wasn't NOT_what NOT_high NOT_school NOT_life NOT_was NOT_like NOT_in NOT_the NOT_seventies ,  then it should have been . 
1468 0 this movie was crap with a capital "c . " the opening scene showed promise .  but that "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going . <br /><br />and the wooden statue ,  morty ,  who was rather creepy in the original film ,  looks plain goofy in this one .  it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume .  (and by the way ,  who else thinks "morty" is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth? it ranks right up there with "jimmy" or "fred" when it comes to horror value .  or why not NOT_just NOT_name NOT_the NOT_wooden NOT_statute NOT_henry-freakin'-kissinger .  "run ,  it's dr .  kissinger!" that'd be about as scary as "morty . )<br /><br />and then there's a scene where the "hero" hits his father's tombstone with---"a sledgehammer?" you might guess--"a two-by-four?" someone might venture .  no ,  he angrily beats his father's tombstone with a twig---a freakin' twig .  but worse than that ,  once the characters walk away ,  the tombstone actually ,  and inexplicably ,  bleeds .  oh brother!<br /><br />there's also a native american guy who lives with the main character's grandparents ,  but apparently ,  does nothing except morty-maintenance .  he perpetuates creepy morty-legends ,  warns those who scoff ,  and even fixes morty's arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank .  but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty ,  does morty give a rat's hairy behind? no . <br /><br />the movie drags on ,  and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (sort of) .  this film is a real yawner .  don't NOT_rent NOT_it . 
1469 1 this film is a jolt of punk rock fun ,  from start to finish .  the ramones ,  reigning princes of late-70s punk rock ,  appear as themselves .  pj soles stars as riff randle ,  the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll .  riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones ,  her favorite rock band .  she keeps the school rockin' ,  and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics . <br /><br />meanwhile the school that riff attends ,  has just hired a brand-new principal ,  named ms .  togar .  she's a tall ,  intimidating amazon of a woman .  and she vows to make the students 'toe-the-line' .  she even has a couple of the students act as monitors ,  who report back to her with dirt on their classmates .  ms .  togar is especially determined to nab riff ,  and put a stop to riff's anarchic shenanigans .  but riff has clever ways to foil togar ,  at every turn . <br /><br />kudos to the superb performance of mary woronov ,  in her role as principal togar .  mary is a legendary b movie actress .  and in this film ,  she plays the fascist ms .  togar ,  with sneering relish .  pj soles as riff ,  turns in an electrifying performance .  clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer ,  has lots of fun with his role . <br /><br />the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film .  and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential ,  in the 70s punk rock scene .  certainly ,  this is a good film for ramones fans .  but even if you're not NOT_into NOT_the NOT_ramones ,  or punk rock ,  this movie is a terrific blast (literally) of energetic fun . 
1470 0 five-year-old michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father "the highwayman , " who later commits suicide .  "20 years later" grown mike (gordon currie ,  from puppet master 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to "master their own fears" at a halloween night costume party .  morty ,  a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the indian handyman ,  becomes possessed by the dead father's spirit and kills them off using their phobias .  characters are thrown out a window ,  drowned in a toilet ,  eaten by rats ,  blown up ,  etc .  morty morphs into the dad and a tree ,  walks around and makes stupid wisecracks .  after finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box ,  the characters remain in the house ,  act cheerful ,  crack jokes and have sex . <br /><br />the morty design is good and betsy palmer (mrs .  voorhees from the original friday the 13th) is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother ,  but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares ,  bad acting ,  brain-dead characters ,  repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera-work .  plus the only two minority characters (the indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die .  blah! 
1471 1 marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of vince lombardi high school are confronted with a new ,  dictatorial principal named miss togar (mary woronov) .  togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions .  leading the charge against her is fun-loving riff randell (p . j .  soles) ,  the #1 ramones fan who ,  more than anything ,  wants the rock group to record her songs . <br /><br />now *this* is an impossible movie to resist .  first and foremost ,  the soundtrack is incredible ,  with songs by such artists as alice cooper and the velvet underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of ramones songs .  "teenage lobotomy" ,  "sheena is a punk rocker" ,  and "blitzkrieg bop" are just a few of them .  next ,  the cast truly gives it their all ,  with soles an ideal choice for the role of riff; she is a true delight .  vincent van patten and dey young are earnest as tom and kate ,  woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful togar ,  clint howard has one of his best ever parts as washroom-occupying entrepreneur eaglebauer ,  and new world regulars such as dick miller ,  paul bartel (particularly fun as music teacher mr .  mcgree) and the real don steele are fun as always .  and ,  of course ,  it's a treat to see the ramones playing themselves . <br /><br />the movie has true spirit .  the energy level is high ,  with co-story author and director allan arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings .  there's also a great sense of humor .  the paper airplane gag is a superb example of this .  this extends right to the "wipe" style of scene transitions .  there are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable rob bottin ,  in one of his earliest gigs . <br /><br />about as good as an authority-defying ,  defend-one's-right-to-party film can get .  "rock 'n' roll high school" is ,  quite simply ,  a wonderful cult film . <br /><br />8/10 
1472 0 twenty years ago ,  the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later .  on the present days ,  michael (gordon currie) invites his girlfriend peg (stacy grant) and his best friends chris (myc agnew) ,  jennifer (emmanuelle vaugier) ,  lisa ann (kelly benson) ,  ned (brendon beiser) ,  mitch maldive (phillip rhys) and trish (rachel hayward) to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm .  he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear ,  and together with his indian friend crow (byron chief moon) ,  they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty (jon fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever .  the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father ,  but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father ,  killing his friends . <br /><br />"the fear: resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows ,  but in a messy screenplay full of clichã©s .  there are some exaggerated performances ,  like for example ms .  betsy palmer; others very weak ,  but in general the acting is good .  unfortunately there is no NOT_explanation NOT_why NOT_the NOT_dummy NOT_is NOT_brought NOT_to NOT_live; NOT_further ,  in spite of being surrounded by close friends ,  the group does not NOT_feel NOT_pain NOT_or NOT_sorrow NOT_when NOT_each NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them NOT_dies .  the low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation .  in the very end ,  michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not NOT_noticed NOT_along NOT_the NOT_story .  i do not NOT_know NOT_whether NOT_the NOT_previous NOT_reference NOT_was NOT_edited NOT_in NOT_the NOT_dvd NOT_released NOT_in NOT_brazil NOT_with NOT_87 NOT_minutes NOT_running NOT_time .  the special effects are very reasonable for a b-movie .  my vote is four . <br /><br />title (brazil): "fear 2: uma noite de halloween" ("fear 2: one night of halloween") 
1473 1 a must for any punk rocker ,  this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early 1980's (when it first appeared on premium cable stations) .  this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies ,  with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show .  originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars ,  but the release of the "live at budakon" album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie .  very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which sadly never NOT_happened NOT_until NOT_after NOT_the NOT_bands NOT_demise) .  the band ,  dee dee especially ,  always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows .  this movie ,  like most classics ,  is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday .  don't NOT_expect NOT_more ,  you won't NOT_find NOT_it .  it's great fun ,  so enjoy it .  another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy ,  featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear . 
1474 0 wow!<br /><br />i just was given this film from a friend of mine ,  who bought it for 1 . 98 at walmart ,  and he felt that he got taken! it is beyond boring ,  most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen ,  the acting is somewhat improvised ,  almost as if they didn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_script .  the martians are cgi ,  which look like they were done by a novice ,  or a fan produced movie .  i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is!<br /><br />example: in one of the scenes ,  the martians are torturing a local female captive .  she goes from a woman in front of a green screen ,  to a cgi copy of that woman .  the change is totally noticeable ,  and when she is killed ,  you can see that it is a computer figure ,  looking like something from a game back in 1990!<br /><br />if at all possible ,  avoid this movie like the plague! you can download two trailers from their site ,  and see how god-awful it really is! 
1475 1 it's amazing that actress p . j .  soles didn't NOT_become NOT_a NOT_big NOT_star NOT_after NOT_playing NOT_riff NOT_randall ,  #1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones ,  in "rock 'n' roll high school" .  soles is so exuberant ,  you don't NOT_mind NOT_she's NOT_obviously NOT_too NOT_old NOT_to NOT_still NOT_be NOT_in NOT_high NOT_school NOT_(that NOT_fact NOT_is NOT_leveled NOT_out NOT_by NOT_having NOT_all NOT_the NOT_kids NOT_look NOT_24) .  the movie is a fast-paced frolic that doesn't NOT_cop-out; NOT_everything NOT_gets NOT_blown NOT_to NOT_smithereens NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end ,  and that's just as it should be .  mary woronov ,  an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazi-like principal ,  gets a great ,  one-of-a-kind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did they use on that ,  or was it a fluke?) and dey young is very appealing as soles' best ,  kate rambeau .  the weakest link ,  ironically enough ,  in this "high school" chain-gang is the ramones .  they can't NOT_act ,  they're not NOT_funny ,  and their concert segment goes on too long .  one ramones song ,  "i want you around" ,  is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good ,  particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning ("did we meet somewhere before?") .  great fun! *** from ****

1478 0 hines and goforth ,  the perpetrators of this crime ,  begin on the wrong foot first step ,  by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously .  that simply isn't NOT_true .  wells was very much an inheritor of the enlightenment ,  and his main concern was that victorian self-satisfaction might leave the british unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad . <br /><br />two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (i was reminded of fay wray in the original king kong) ,  rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialog reeks of 'victorianisms' uttered seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek . <br /><br />all of this looks suspiciously like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects - which by the way are so poorly accomplished ,  the warner bros .  cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job .  (gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons ,  i expected them to float away any minute . ) think the yellow submarine as done by the old ec comics . <br /><br />worse yet is the loss of theme ,  which robs the film of any reason to exist .  although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era ,  they utterly miss the uncanny way wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war - a fact not NOT_unnoticed NOT_by NOT_wells NOT_himself ,  who ,  after the war ,  reworked the theme in the shape of things to come . <br /><br />without any theme ,  all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons ,  when they're not NOT_trying NOT_out NOT_for NOT_a NOT_high NOT_school NOT_production NOT_of NOT_a NOT_drunken NOT_student's NOT_rewrite NOT_of NOT_macbeth . <br /><br />really ,  this is the worst ,  most senseless piece of drivel i have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the eastern european cartoon "fantastic planet" thirty years ago .  that film was so pretentiously dull ,  my friend and i and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half-way through ,  and sat near the screen playing cards ,  using the movie as light by which to see the cards - its only usefulness ,  as far as any of us could tell . <br /><br />but i already have electric lighting in my apartment ,  so i didn't NOT_need NOT_this NOT_put-down NOT_of NOT_wells NOT_for NOT_anything . <br /><br />do not NOT_avoid NOT_this NOT_film NOT_- NOT_steal NOT_every NOT_copy NOT_you NOT_can NOT_(don't NOT_pay NOT_a NOT_cent) NOT_and NOT_burn NOT_each NOT_and NOT_every NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them .  god in his wisdom created us just for this purpose . 
1479 1 i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids ,  from her disney years .  i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoe . <br /><br />"foxes" was such a huge departure from all of that . <br /><br />where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy ("little darlings" ,  anyone?) ,  jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction . <br /><br />this was not NOT_disney .  this was not NOT_porky's .  this was not NOT_"halloweed" .  this was a dark & powerful story of the destruction of young lives .  sadly it's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country ,  this film could be replayed (with a current soundtrack) and still be wholly relevant . <br /><br />it's not NOT_the NOT_best NOT_film NOT_ever NOT_made ,  it is tired at some parts ,  not NOT_all NOT_the NOT_performances NOT_are NOT_particularly NOT_outstanding .  but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver) . <br /><br />7 out of 10 barky 
1480 0 well ,  on it's credit side (if it can be said to have one) ,  timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h . g .  wells' outstanding novella .  but other than that - well ,  to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime .  what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged $20 million dollar budget! timothy hines really does make mr .  wood ,  who was a flawed genius anyway ,  look like the best filmmaker of all time .  the special effects (i guess you'd call them that) are not NOT_even NOT_up NOT_to NOT_computer NOT_game NOT_standards .  the acting is ,  well ,  perhaps about dinner theater comparable ,  and the accents are atrocious .  at the risk of sounding offensive ,  a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is (especially poor ogilvy) ,  well ,  ahem ,   .   .   .  gay! poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside ,  waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor .  hey ,  the stormtroopers in "star wars" had neat white body armor too ,  and it didn't NOT_work NOT_either ,  they still got blasted .  even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians' 'heat ray'(?) ,  they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance ,  even when they're theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons ,  which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing .  maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen ,  being left over from "jason and the argonauts" .  or was it "josie and the pussycats"? i dunno .  the soldiers ,  presumably because they're 'military' ,  all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode ,  like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him .  wow! i loved it! but the 'soldiers' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war ,  or boer commandos (which would be more or less correct for the period .  perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines?) .  oddly enough ,  the character of the curate looks exactly like he's drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble ,  and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting .  oh ,  yeah .  musn't forget the thunder child .  in the book ,  the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo-ram .  it was meant to ram enemy ships .  yet ,  it's bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker-toy constructed martian war machines ,  with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak ,  and she sank .  an ironclad warship like thunderchild could've rammed the titanic and survived ,  but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest-bidder constraints as our own military .  the costumes are all wrong ,  especially the british army and police uniforms ,  cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas .  and timbo ,  in an obvious homage to western films of yore ,  has obviously set his movie in wild western england ,  because all his riders are using western saddles .  the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre ,  and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky .  on the credit side ,  and contrary to what one reviewer wrote ,  the only genuine ,  authentic feature of this thing is the artillery .  the guns are not NOT_from NOT_the NOT_civil NOT_war ,  but appear to my eye and research as bona-fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders ,  perfectly authentic to the period .  so was the ammunition shown being used .  but the artilleryman ,  who is a driver in the horse artillery ,  was not NOT_shown NOT_correctly NOT_driving NOT_his NOT_limber .  you don't NOT_sit NOT_on NOT_the NOT_frigging NOT_limber NOT_box NOT_and NOT_drive NOT_a NOT_gun NOT_team ,  you ride the nearside wheel horses .  the opening ,  using what i believe is authentic period film footage ,  is okay ,  and the score's not NOT_bad .  however ,  to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never NOT_had NOT_an NOT_underground ,  and it certainly didn't NOT_in NOT_1898 . <br /><br />but growing up reading this novel ,  i am very disappointed .  even more disappointed then i was at spielberg's zillion dollar ,  special effects laden version .  maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise ,  and vice versa .  i have a lot more to say ,  but i'll let it go at this for now: i wish somebody would make a good version of "war of the worlds" that's faithful to the original .  timmy's vision is fine for a high school film class ,  or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college-level film student ,  and about as bad ,  which is about the best i can say for this thing ,  but that's about it .  oh ,  yeah .  just where did the budget go? and what happened to michael caine? i'd like to hear his comments! i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo "orson wood" hines' breathtaking ,  bound-breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk-taking director's ticket to cult stardom ,  because ,  i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie ,  which i didn't NOT_pay NOT_for NOT_anyway NOT_but NOT_was NOT_thoughtfully NOT_sent NOT_to NOT_me NOT_by NOT_a NOT_friend NOT_who NOT_burned NOT_a NOT_dvd NOT_copy NOT_for NOT_me ,  with no NOT_malicious NOT_intent NOT_that NOT_i've NOT_been NOT_able NOT_to NOT_determine .  i must add here that i thought blackmoon's dubbed and abridged version was not NOT_only NOT_a NOT_vast NOT_improvement ,  but an absolute ,  hysterically funny (in a good way) treat to watch .  i find it hard to watch master timbo's version after blackmoon .  keep it up ,  tim! make your own version of "dune" ,  now .  it just awaits the hand of a master like you! and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield? forget it .  it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness! hey get a life!timbo is worse than the master ed wood! i kid you not! 
1481 1 "foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s .  and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (porky's ,  fast times at ridgement high) ,  the movie holds up well against time . <br /><br />its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio (remember him?) lead a fine young cast that's well worth watching . <br /><br />the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents .  the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties ,  concerts ,  or out on the street .  seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill ,  party ,  or boy away . <br /><br />but rather than condemning them ,  the film is sympathetic ,  blaming absent ,  uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone .  and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike . <br /><br />the film's opening â– a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows .  we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood ,  from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola ,  while donna summer's "on the radio" is scored beneath . <br /><br />from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life .  annie (runaway rocker cherie currie) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill .  deirdre (kandice stroh) is the boy crazy drama queen .  madge (marlilyn stroh) is the shy girl in over her head .  and foster is the one with the plan .  it's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line (sally kellerman) . <br /><br />it's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at . <br /><br />despite its age ,  "foxes" remains a pleasure to watch .  dated hair ,  clothes ,  and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill haven't hurt the movie . <br /><br />the cinematography is simply stunning ,  with breathtaking filtered shots of the l . a .  basin at dawn ,  dusk and at night .  giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ian . <br /><br />perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never NOT_broke NOT_out NOT_like NOT_the NOT_casts NOT_of NOT_"st .  elmo's fire" (1985) or "empire records" (1995) .  "foxes" shows why they should have .  but perhaps like bowling for soup's song "1985 , " they just hit a wall . 
1482 0 i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty ,  and i can honestly say i feel violated .  i had read the reviews and heard the warnings ,  and i thought i was prepared for anything - at best i thought ,  a faithful (if misguided) attempt at an original adaptation; at worst ,  a so-good-it's-bad "plan 9" for the new millennium .  so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk ,  i joked to my friends "prepare for the worst movie ever made!" oh ,  cruel karma .  there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film .  the "special" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81 .  the acting is terrible ,  the accents are worse than terrible (one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles ,  from scotland to wales via northern ireland) ,  the dialogue is stilted ,  the editing is non-existent ,  the production values prove that no NOT_expense NOT_has NOT_been NOT_gone NOT_to .  words really cannot describe how bad this movie is; from the union flag flying from the horribly cgi'd thunderchild (the royal navy flies the white ensign ,  not NOT_the NOT_union NOT_flag) NOT_to NOT_the NOT_woodworm NOT_ridden NOT_acting ,  this is quite simply a crime against film making .  when you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the 'net (the star wars short "troops" for example) ,  the whole "we're enthusiastic amateurs" argument goes right out of the window .  and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website ,  this film had an 8 figure budget! i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not NOT_come NOT_cheap NOT_in NOT_the NOT_us .  maybe the problem is that hines & co tried to make a film of the book ,  rather than turn the book into a film (if that makes any sense) .  characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words .  ironically enough ,  the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers ,  the ex-soft porn actress .  my advice? pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn't NOT_screw NOT_up ,  and go watch the spielberg version .  it may not NOT_be NOT_true NOT_to NOT_the NOT_text NOT_of NOT_the NOT_book ,  but i can say this; as a lifelong hg wells fan (and englishman as well) speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book .  maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country ,  but i will say this: timothy hines stole three hours of my life ,  and i want them back . 
1483 1 i was just a bit young for this one ,  but i had to see it .  there's some excellent music ,  which many folks have mentioned ,  but no NOT_one NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_notice NOT_a NOT_very NOT_rare NOT_appearance NOT_by NOT_"angel" ,  a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit .  wearing their trademark white outfits ,  they grind through "20th century foxes" ,  and apparently all try to cram into the camera's field of vision .  keyboardist gregg giuffria remains the bands highlight ,  and has apparently never NOT_gotten NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_haircut ,  ever! cherie currie (ex-runaways singer) begins a brief ,  but notable ,  acting career here ,  and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster ,  and the rest .  (her topless 3-d scenes in "parasite" ,  and her ufo sighting ,  in "wavelength" kept us all watching her for a time) .  <br /><br />it's not NOT_a NOT_masterpiece ,  but it preserves a chunk of its period ,  for all to gaze upon ,  and wonder . 
1484 0 if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went .  a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage ,  although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really ,  really cool on an original play-station 1 game ,  and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made .  what puzzles me is where did the money go? pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83 ,  and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or ruining in this case) for about the same 20 million .  this is quite possibly the worst film ever made! i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again .  i hated it completely! i regress .  i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes ,  or santa claus conquers the martians ,  these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them ,  you love them .  there is no NOT_love NOT_for NOT_this NOT_film NOT_and NOT_no NOT_place NOT_in NOT_my NOT_dvd NOT_library NOT_for NOT_it .  i sold it to a guy for a dollar .  i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew .  shame on you pendragon films! i want my money back! 
1485 1 coming of age movies are quite usual these days .  for 1980 ,  "foxes" really gives its meaning .  jodie foster plays her character straight out .  ever since she did "taxi driver" four years earlier ,  she has a stronger character in this movie .  she's jeanie ,  a high schooler who has plenty of guts ,  and seems to get out of any situation she's in .  scott baio plays brad way before chachi on "happy days" .  he's deemed immature by the other girls .  cherie currie is annie ,  hangs with the wrong crowd ,  chased by her policeman father .  jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand .  exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous .  annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted .  reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident .  and one gets married to a much older man .  growing up isn't NOT_easy ,  sometimes we got to explore life how it is .  in reality ,  you got to be careful about the people surrounding you .  for me ,  i was my own person ,  and i tend to stay that way! great music ,  great plot ,  this movie's a gem! 4 out of 5 stars! 
1486 0 holy freaking god all-freaking-mighty .  this movie was so bad ,  i thought i was on drugs .  in a bad way .  .  .  the character acting is the poorest thing i've seen in quite some time .  this movie was more akin to lord of the g-strings ,  imho(it's a real movie) .  most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen .  my favorite part was when they are in the carriage ,  and you can tell there's no NOT_horse .  they're fleeing from alien monsters ,  and going about the same speed as a swift jog .  then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous cg horse .  and the cg in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's beyond the mind's eye .  i mean ,  come on ,  really .  it felt like a horrible episode of hercules ,  only without kevin sorbo there to save the day .  worst .  movie .  ever . 
1487 1 this work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution .  though this is a broad generalization ,  parents of that time were too self-absorbed to be real parents ,  and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues ,  where their children were concerned .  <br /><br />this film teaches us how to let go ,  even when it is painful ,  and does so with a sweet ,  melancholy ,  but informed style whereby foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life .  i loved that scene .  it was my favorite scene in the movie ,  actually . <br /><br />the transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on ,  and so must we .  baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass ,  and we are meant to get through them ,  to better times . <br /><br />the whole metaphor of "moving on , " and the procession of life ,  is present throughout the film ,  and serves to give us hope ,  in the end . <br /><br />i like this movie ,  though i do not NOT_watch NOT_it NOT_often ,  as it tends to make me melancholy . <br /><br />it shouldn't be viewed by young children ,  and probably only those raised in the 1970's-80's would want to . <br /><br />it rates a 7 . 4/10 from .  .  . <br /><br />the fiend : .

1489 1 "foxes" is one movie i remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's .  as i am exactly jodie foster's age ,  i related to this movie .  it deals with the frustrations ,  temptations ,  relationships & rebellion of youth .  the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg .  "more than a feeling" by boston and sad numbers like "on the radio" by donna summer .  the music of my late teens .  yep ,  i'll always remember this one ,  even if it wasn't NOT_huge . 
1490 0 i'm not NOT_really NOT_sure NOT_how NOT_to NOT_even NOT_begin NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_how NOT_bad NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_is .  i like bad films ,  as they are often the most entertaining .  i love bad special effects ,  bad acting ,  bad music ,  and inept direction .  with the exception of the music (which was better than i had expected) ,  this movie had all of those qualities .  <br /><br />the special effects were amazingly bad .  the worst i've seen since my nintendo 64 .  some scenes to watch for include the thunderchild ,  the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot ,  the big ben scene ,  the train wreck .  .  .  wow ,  there are so many bad effects! on the plus side ,  though ,  some scenes of the alien walkers are well done . <br /><br />the acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been ,  having been based directly on h . g .  wells' book .  for having such good source material ,  it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny .  and then there's the mustache .  .  .  the single most distracting piece of facial hair i've seen in a long time .  of course ,  only half the movie contains acting .  the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots . <br /><br />to say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors .  with the use of different colored filters between shots for no NOT_particular NOT_reason ,  the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes ,  the bad green screening ,  it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie .  i wouldn't NOT_imagine NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be NOT_possible NOT_to NOT_turn NOT_a NOT_brilliant NOT_book NOT_into NOT_this NOT_bad NOT_a NOT_movie .  bravo ,  mr .  hines .  bravo .  <br /><br />my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies over ,  drink ,  play poker while watching it ,  keep drinking ,  and maybe you'll make it all the way through .  it does make for an excellent bad movie ,  so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster . 
1491 1 "foxes" is a great film .  the four young actresses jodie foster ,  cherie currie ,  marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are wonderful .  the song "on the radio" by donna summer is lovely .  a great film .  ***** 
1492 0 save the $8 . 97 you'll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg . <br /><br />i'm a filmmaker ,  and being an avid fan of h . g .  wells ,  i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment .  instead ,  it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time .  it's horrible . <br /><br />there are reports that timothy hines had a $20 million budget for this production .  where the heck did it go? did he use most of it to buy a new house? finance his retirement? or what? let me start with what is actually good about this film .  it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it .  i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film .  but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible .  .  .  and i do mean horrible special effects .  any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi .  to me ,  most of it looked like "stop action" card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a $20 million project should be using . <br /><br />there's no NOT_excuse NOT_for NOT_the NOT_amateur NOT_post NOT_production NOT_that NOT_was NOT_applied NOT_to NOT_this NOT_film .  my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than $1500 . 00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created .  i've seen films with budgets of less than $2 million look better .  much better . <br /><br />in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines' special effects in this film .  in fact ,  i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film .  there's no NOT_excuse NOT_with NOT_today's NOT_technology NOT_for NOT_a NOT_film NOT_to NOT_look NOT_like NOT_a NOT_50's NOT_b-movie NOT_unless NOT_that NOT_was NOT_the NOT_intention ,  which shouldn't have been with this particular project . <br /><br />a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky ,  another demonstration of amateur film-making . <br /><br />overall ,  i have to say that i produced a $45 , 000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film . <br /><br />i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead .  it would be easier on the eyes . 
1493 1 as i reach the "backside" of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed ,  drug influenced teens of today .  it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today .  this film drives that point home to the core .  if you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film .  from kiss-posters to an angel concert this movie rocks ! <br /><br />watch for a young laura dern .  why they didn't NOT_have NOT_more NOT_songs NOT_from NOT_the NOT_runaways NOT_i'll NOT_never NOT_know NOT_?

1496 0 i love movies ,  and i'll watch any movie all the way through ,  just to give it a chance .  i can finally say that i found a movie i can't NOT_watch NOT_all NOT_the NOT_way NOT_through .  the acting is terribly stale and monotone ,  the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software ,  and .  .  .  .  . the long scenes of just .  .  . walking!!!! and this movie is three hours long!!! i didn't NOT_even NOT_make NOT_it NOT_15 NOT_minutes NOT_until NOT_i NOT_fast NOT_forwarded NOT_the NOT_dvd .  the scenes with the aliens are very short .  ummm ,  instead of naming this "war of the worlds" ,  lets name this "war of the walking long distances" .  this cost 5 million dollars to make! what they spend the money on ,  the dramatic opening song?<br /><br />oh ,  but on a positive note ,  one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people .  that's hilarious ,  not NOT_because NOT_people NOT_are NOT_dying ,  but because when they turn to skeletons ,  they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward . <br /><br />so .  .  .  . like i said ,  if you are a fan of boring ,  stale ,  action-less movies ,  here is one for you dvd collection .  but i didn't NOT_write NOT_this NOT_for NOT_you ,  i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie .  it is not NOT_worth NOT_your NOT_time NOT_or NOT_money<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i NOT_know NOT_this NOT_is NOT_by NOT_the NOT_book ,  but the book isn't NOT_that NOT_long ,  and i'm a complete book worm/nerd/geek/whatever ,  but why? just get the steven spielberg version ,  it's not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_good ,  but it's 10 times better than this!! <br /><br />i give this a big ,  fat zero out of 10 . 
1497 1 this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago .  it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered . <br /><br />clothes and music might have changed over time ,  but in the end this is a story that will never NOT_lose NOT_its NOT_up-to-dateness .  and especially this movie does the job pretty well .  of course it is cheesy at times ,  but very touching as well . <br /><br />jodie foster's performance is striking ,  and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies . <br /><br />don't miss this one .

1499 1 this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion ,  its thought provoking ,  funny and sad with amazing performances all around! .  all the characters are wonderful ,  and the story is just brilliant! ,  plus jodie foster and cherie currie are simply amazing in this! .  the ending is very powerful ,  however i won't NOT_spoil NOT_it NOT_for NOT_you ,  and i thought the character development was top notch! ,  plus you can really relate to all of the characters ,  especially jeanie and annie ,  as you will be rooting for them! ,  plus i loved how it moved slowly ,  and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about .  i can't NOT_believe NOT_this NOT_only NOT_has NOT_a NOT_5 . 9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion ,  and it was funny seeing randy quaid in this type of role ,  plus this is extremely well written and made as well! .  one scene that really got to me was when madge(marilyn kagan) ,  is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party ,  and the film has many surprising moments as well! ,  plus the dialog is especially excellent .  this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time (in my opinion) ,  its thought provoking ,  funny and sad with amazing performances all around ,  and i say go see it immediately! ,  your bound to love it! .  the direction is fantastic! .  adrian lyne does a fantastic job here ,  with awesome camera work ,  and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace! .  the acting is amazing! .  jodie foster is really cute ,  and is amazing as always! ,  she was extremely likable ,  caring ,  had a lovable character ,  was intense in some scenes ,  was focused ,  and she and cherie currie were the heart of the film as jeanie and annie!(foster rules!!!!!!!) .  cherie currie is way hot ,  and is amazing here ,  i really felt sorry for her character ,  as she had a very likable character that just needed help ,  she gives a powerful performance ,  and created a very memorable character she was amazing! .  scott baio is great as brad he was really likable ,  and did his job well i liked him .  randy quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him .  sally kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot .  marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are both very good as madge and deirdre ,  and did what they had to do well as the other two friends .  laura dern has a very early role here ,  as it was cool to see her ,  not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_part NOT_though .  rest of the cast do fine .  overall go see it immediately ,  it's an underrated masterpiece! .  ***** out of 5 
1500 0 after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd .  that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true .  for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not NOT_show NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen NOT_at NOT_all .  the list of problems with the film could drag on forever .  chief amongst them is the film is simply too long .  it dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours .  nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly .  <br /><br />secondly ,  as many had pointed out from the "trailers" ,  the special effects are anything but special .  the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-z 1970's or 1980's quality .  probably the worst effects of all were the horses ,  which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved .  the heat ray effects were laughable ,  as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles .  also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence ,  in which the thunderchild ,  described in the book as an ironclad ram ,  looked nothing of the sort .  instead it resembled a world war 1 era destroyer ,  complete with deck guns (which fired but had no NOT_visible NOT_crew) ,  and torpedo tubes .  <br /><br />the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects .  most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky .  well ,  the sky is black ,  but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight .  there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape ,  bathed in full sunlight ,  and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars .  to detract even further ,  the color of the scenes made no NOT_sense .  in some they are bathed in orange light .  in others green light .  in still others it's blue light .  in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue .  the frame-rate and camera is very shaky ,  giving everything a stuttering look . <br /><br />finally ,  the acting is overall sub-par .  one man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache .  this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were .  the english accents ,  even to american ears ,  are outrageous .  <br /><br />in summary ,  this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times .  i have not NOT_seen NOT_gigli NOT_or NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_recent NOT_flops NOT_but NOT_this NOT_one ,  because of it's poor quality in every respect ,  must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out .  i would not NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_if NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_makes NOT_it NOT_to NOT_the NOT_bottom NOT_10 NOT_or NOT_20 NOT_in NOT_the NOT_imdb NOT_rankings .  it's a pity that mystery science theater is not NOT_still NOT_around . 
1501 1 jodie foster ,  cherie currie (the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the runaways in her remarkably able acting debut) ,  marilyn kagan ,  and kandice stroh are uniformly believable ,  splendid and touching as the titular quartet ,  who are a tight-knit clique of troubled ,  fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent ,  uncaring ,  self-absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley ,  california suburbs .  the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex ,  drugs ,  alcohol ,  commitment ,  and so on at a tender young age when they're not NOT_fully NOT_prepared NOT_to NOT_completely NOT_own NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_potentially NOT_harmful NOT_consequences NOT_of NOT_said NOT_decisions .  foster ,  giving one of her most perceptive ,  affecting and underrated performances to date ,  is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; she's especially concerned about the good-hearted ,  but reckless and self-destructive currie ,  whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end . <br /><br />this picture offers a poignant ,  insightful ,  often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken ,  dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families: tough ,  resilient ,  but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent .  adrian ("fatal attraction , " "jacob's ladder") lyne's direction is both sturdy and observant while gerald ayres' script is somewhat messy and rambling ,  but overall still accurate in its frank ,  gritty ,  unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid's nerve-wrackingly chaotic ,  capricious and unpredictable everyday life .  leon bijou's soft ,  dewy ,  almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence .  giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score ,  which makes particularly effective use of donna summer's elegiac "on the radio . " the top-notch cast includes sally kellerman as foster's neurotic ,  insecure ,  peevish mother ,  scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude ,  randy quaid as kagan's rich older boyfriend ,  british 60's pop singer adam faith as foster's feckless ,  absentee rock promoter father ,  and lois smith as kagan's smothering ,  overprotective mother .  appearing in brief bits are robert romanus (mike damone "fast times at richmont high") as one of foster's morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky ,  braces-wearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher .  achingly authentic ,  engrossing and deeply moving (currie's grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking) ,  "foxes" is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence . 
1502 0 i honestly believe that anyone considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure .  like the "films" of edward wood ,  jr .  in the '60s and '70s ,  this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts ,  re-editing their films ,  and reworking their special effects until they finally look right .  this movie is also a decent argument for the studios' pre-screening process .  if mr .  hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience ,  perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes . <br /><br />film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is "good enough" can truly be .  every performance ,  every line of dialog ,  every digital effect ,  every filter effect ,  indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity .  a beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think "at least i accomplished something" or "just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself" .  this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out . <br /><br />critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment "the worst movie ever made" . <br /><br />beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are ,  and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites .  also ,  beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay ,  and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story .  writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think "i can do better than that" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results . <br /><br />i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers .  particularly those entering the craft in this current post-lucas and post-spielberg environment .  there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects .  the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not NOT_everyone NOT_can NOT_pull NOT_it NOT_off .  some can't NOT_even NOT_come NOT_close NOT_to NOT_it . 
1503 1 this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misconception of it as a teen flick .  it has wonderful performances ,  particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother ,  played by a convincing sally kellerman .  the three girls that play jodie's friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing .

NOT_orson NOT_welles NOT_made NOT_himself NOT_a NOT_household NOT_name NOT_doing NOT_just NOT_that .  however ,  hines thinks he's a filmmaker ,  so he's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning . <br /><br />secondly ,  hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie ,  but he has no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_to NOT_use NOT_them .  now i for one have no NOT_unquenchable NOT_sweet NOT_tooth NOT_for NOT_eye NOT_candy .  i believe good science fiction cinema doesn't NOT_need NOT_dazzling NOT_technical NOT_effects .  some really potent sci-fi's have flourished on virtually none at all .  but "the war of the worlds" as film requires a certain baseline effort .  wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled .  the effects don't NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_complex; NOT_they NOT_can NOT_even NOT_be NOT_crude NOT_(e . g .  fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal/byron haskins 1953 version) ,  but they must be handled well .  unfortunately hines' effects are both crude and incompetent â– tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum â– martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort â– skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream -- the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times (flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not NOT_notice) NOT_â– NOT_and NOT_on NOT_ad NOT_nauseum .  crude technique is forgivable .  so you have a cg fire effect that's less than convincing? fine ,  we can work around that .  just don't NOT_use NOT_it NOT_too NOT_often NOT_and NOT_only NOT_show NOT_glimpses NOT_of NOT_it .  that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum? throw it away .  it's not NOT_necessary .  you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string? if you must use it ,  go ahead ,  but please don't NOT_show NOT_it NOT_twice! NOT_but NOT_no ,  hines won't NOT_listen .  we get the worst looking stuff used again and again .  gotta get those 180 minutes somehow ,  boy . <br /><br />next we have acting ,  or more precisely too much acting .  whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out .  evidently hines thinks he's getting a bargain -- more fleeing in terror over there! you ,  quaking behind that tree ,  let's have a real conniption fit this take .  you call that writhing in agony? nonsense ,  my grandmother can writhe better -- nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink .  they aren't NOT_even NOT_good NOT_amateurs .  but this needn't prove fatal .  many a good movie has been made with rancid acting .  that's what directors are for .  and editors .  which brings up another pointâ… who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory? if america's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no NOT_beef .  in spite of the near three-hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie -- not NOT_sequences ,  but single frames ,  creating a herky-jerky effect that's nauseating to watch .  maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890's .  if he was i can say he doesn't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_do NOT_it . 
1505 1 four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties ,  drugs ,  cops ,  mixed-up parents ,  older boyfriends .  jodie foster ,  sort of the mother hen of the pack ,  tries keeping everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she's never NOT_had) ,  and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't .  slowly ,  everyone grows up and goes away .  that precise plot point ,  though underscored throughout ,  is unfortunately tampered with .  did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? or an even longer sequence--also with baio--where foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion" .  some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy ,  and i didn't NOT_much NOT_care NOT_for NOT_an NOT_edit NOT_late NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_that NOT_segues NOT_clumsily NOT_from NOT_a NOT_death NOT_to NOT_a NOT_wedding .  but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond .  and jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes .  if viewers do get choked up at the end ,  the movie has earned this .  it doesn't NOT_pander NOT_for NOT_tears NOT_or NOT_ask NOT_for NOT_sympathy .  it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand .  *** from **** 
1506 0 wow .  .  . <br /><br />i picked this up at the local wal-mart after reading online that it had been released early .  i've been following this online for some time ,  and just had to buy the film . <br /><br />wow .  .  . <br /><br />i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing ,  or lack thereof .  time and again ,  characters (usually the narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking .  .  . and walking .  .  . and walking .  i am not NOT_an NOT_editor ,  but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b .  there is no NOT_need NOT_to NOT_show NOT_almost NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_journey! NOT_wow .  .  . <br /><br />i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this .  they seem to have been given no NOT_direction NOT_as NOT_to NOT_what NOT_to NOT_do NOT_during NOT_scenes NOT_other NOT_than NOT_to NOT_look NOT_scared NOT_or NOT_look NOT_happy ,  depending on what action was to be added at a later date . <br /><br />wow .  .  . <br /><br />why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me .  even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes .  one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities ,  including london .  at times these folk are coming and going with no NOT_regard NOT_as NOT_to NOT_the NOT_angle NOT_of NOT_the NOT_shot NOT_or NOT_the NOT_distance NOT_they NOT_are NOT_from NOT_the NOT_camera .  in one shot in london ,  there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache) .  not NOT_since NOT_gettysburg NOT_have NOT_i NOT_seen NOT_such NOT_a NOT_fake NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_facial NOT_hair . <br /><br />wow .  .  . <br /><br />why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me .  it is a turkey ,  plain and simple .  on the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while . 
1507 1 story about four teenage girls growing up in california .  jeanie (jodie foster) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (sally kellerman) .  annie (cherie currie) is addicted to drugs ,  alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father .  madge (marilyn kagan) has overprotective parents .  deirde (kandice stroh) thinks she's more mature than the rest of them . <br /><br />this is nothing new from what we've seen plenty of times before--but this one has one big difference--it's accurate .  i graduated from high school in 1980 (when i first saw the film) and i was surprised at how realistic it was .  they got the dialogue ,  clothes and attitudes down completely right .  even the main song of the movie ("on the radio" by donna summer) was a big hit before this came out .  this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters .  i knew girls in high school who were just like this! the film is (of course) dated but it captures a time we will never NOT_see NOT_again . <br /><br />the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance .  the relationship between her and kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done .  even scott baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy . <br /><br />a very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 .  the film has a deserved r rating (plenty of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens .  i give it a 8 . 
1508 0 i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr .  well yes ,  if you exclude the dwarfs ,  the cast of thousands ,  the great special effects ,  the big battles ,  the strong characterization ,  the decent plot ,  the good acting ,  the classy direction and everything else .  which leaves you with the walking .  and boy ,  does this film do walking! if mr piano had his way ,  this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside ,  but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble .  you've never NOT_seen NOT_so NOT_much NOT_walking NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie .  if this really had a $20m budget ,  most of it must have gone on mr piano's shoes ,  because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does .  which explains why there's no NOT_money NOT_left NOT_for NOT_decent NOT_effects ,  a decent video camera or proper actors .  honestly ,  it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes .  even on fast-forward ,  this is a looonnnggg walk . <br /><br />as for the sci-fi stuff ,  i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking ,  which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story . <br /><br />i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs? 
1509 1 if you weren't NOT_there ,  then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you .  which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish ,  it is meant to be for realism .  let's face it--in real life ,  we don't NOT_say NOT_things NOT_in NOT_an NOT_exacting NOT_or NOT_perfect NOT_way ,  even when we mean to .  in this sense ,  it works .  this ,  however ,  does not NOT_apply NOT_to NOT_our NOT_"known" NOT_actors NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film ,  notably jodie foster (born a natural) .  the fact that the other 3 girls are not NOT_accomplished NOT_only NOT_adds NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story--jodie NOT_plays NOT_the NOT_glue NOT_that NOT_struggles NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_their NOT_friendship NOT_close ,  even with the obvious feeling of fatality .  meaning that no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_close NOT_friends NOT_are ,  eventually there are some people that just fade away ,  no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_you NOT_try . <br /><br />and therein is the core of the movie .  it's not NOT_about NOT_partying ,  it's not NOT_about NOT_sexuality ,  but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone . <br /><br />if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life ,  you will feel this movie--it will mean a lot to you ,  no NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_era NOT_it NOT_is NOT_set NOT_in ,  or what era you grew up in .  we all knew these girls in school ,  or at the very least knew of them .  we all knew the frustrated virgin ,  half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her .  we all knew the boy-crazy one ,  the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world ,  her fear of acceptance .  we all knew the party girl ,  the one they whispered about ,  with tales of not NOT_only NOT_her NOT_sad NOT_home NOT_life NOT_but NOT_of NOT_her NOT_notorious NOT_exploits .  and we all knew the "mother figure" ,  the one a little more real ,  a little more grounded ,  a little more sad because she knew what would happen .  maybe you were one of those girls .  maybe ,  like me ,  you had been each one at one time or another .  .  . <br /><br />this film really captures that fragile time in life when want ,  needs ,  pressures ,  womanhood ,  childhood ,  the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female's head ,  each factor on the precipice .  which aspect do you hang on to? what do you toss over the edge ,  no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_you NOT_may NOT_want NOT_to NOT_hold NOT_on? NOT_and NOT_how NOT_painful NOT_is NOT_goodbye NOT_to NOT_everything NOT_you've NOT_known? NOT_that's NOT_what NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_is--steps NOT_into NOT_womanhood NOT_while NOT_clinging NOT_onto NOT_childhood ,  and how damn tough it is to keep walking .  if you were there ,  you know .  .  . and love this film ,  as i do .  aching and tenderly done .  a fine piece of captured femininity . 
1510 0 i am currently sitting here ,  forcing myself to finish this .  i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs ,  might as well suffer for it .  i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for "war of the worlds" cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time ,  and i missed the old tv series from the early 90's .  the website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book .  it was going to be a "perfect translation" .  perfect crap is more in tune with this film . <br /><br />first off ,  the video on this movie was glitched! it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid-90's pc or playstation cd-rom video game .  sadly enough ,  the color quality was similar .  the acting made shatners classic "dramatic pause" look damn near shakespearean in quality .  the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous ,  and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes . <br /><br />secondly ,  it is slow and terribly drawn out .  i sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien .  after that ,  the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid .  i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm .  the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's .  the last thing on that ,  for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's no NOT_one NOT_is NOT_concerned NOT_for NOT_their NOT_life .  it's like they have no NOT_concept .  even though media was slow ,  word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known .  the "illusion" of day and night was shoddy at best .  simply changing the color around the people to purple ,  blue or green does not NOT_signify NOT_night NOT_time .  perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion .  there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the "hero" gallop around or walk down silly roads .  get on with the film .  i know how people get around ,  you do not NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_so NOT_in-depth . <br /><br />now ,  finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines .  mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects .  even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student .  the animations do not NOT_match NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_scenery NOT_at NOT_all . <br /><br />in closing folks ,  if you want "the war of the worlds" ,  do one of four things .  1) watch the 1953 original ,  2) watch the early 90's tv series ,  3) wait for spielberg's rendition to be released shortly ,  or 4) read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary english class) .  avoid this movie .  it is a waste of your money . 
1511 1 dirty sanchez is the more extreme ,  british version of jackass in which the four boys (pritchard ,  dainton ,  joycey and pancho) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other .  the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not NOT_planned NOT_which NOT_makes NOT_the NOT_reaction NOT_much NOT_more NOT_funny .  there are 3 series of the show ,  the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg .  there's an episode on their love lives , jobs etc .  the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations .  the third follows their european tour .  it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series .  in my opinion the third series is the best ,  but trust me when i say ,  if you have a week stomach do not NOT_watch ,  as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode . 
1512 0 normally when i write a review for a movie online ,  it is for one of three reasons .  either ,  i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent ,  i feel that the public's perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons ,  or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers .  while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative ,  i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as ,  "this is one of the best films of all time!" ,  does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides ,  nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good ,  which should be the point of the review in the first place .  with that being said ,  war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried ,  incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggy-backing its loathsome carcass on the multi-million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg .  many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject .  this movie is not NOT_even NOT_"so NOT_bad" NOT_that NOT_it NOT_becomes NOT_funny NOT_or NOT_endearing ,  rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger .  now with most of the insults out of the way ,  allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i .  <br /><br />judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film (i found it as sam's club for 8 bucks) ,  i assumed that the cast would be no-names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular .  check .  this is not NOT_a NOT_big NOT_deal NOT_for NOT_me ,  as i find a large budget and an over-reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie .  i also did not NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_be NOT_blown NOT_away NOT_by NOT_great NOT_dialog NOT_or NOT_a NOT_moving NOT_score .  check again .  what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien/battle scenes .  <br /><br />now ,  as per imdb's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance ,  no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_small ,  so here is fair warning .  the movie opens with a lot of inane small-talk ,  followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot .  seriously ,  it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube .  it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth ,  but by the end of the first ten minutes ,  the combination of shaky camera-work ,  spliced scenes ,  and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer .  however ,  the costuming is surprisingly not NOT_bad NOT_and NOT_the NOT_hope NOT_that NOT_the NOT_pods NOT_will NOT_reveal NOT_something NOT_mysterious NOT_keeps NOT_you NOT_going .  the next 30 minutes basically go as follows: one of the main characters walks to one of the pods ,  he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot .  they both walk back to town .  these walks aren't NOT_two NOT_seconds NOT_or NOT_added NOT_so NOT_that NOT_dialog NOT_may NOT_be NOT_exchanged .  they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie .  in a particularly grueling scene ,  the main character is shown looking at a pod ,  then he is shown pacing and panting ,  then he looks at the pod ,  then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town ,  then comes in to town and walks into a building ,  then he has a cup of coffee and says "thank you mary" to a random maid that serves him coffee ,  then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building ,  then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod .  i apologize for the extreme run-on sentence ,  but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film .  characters speak way too long about mundane things ,  they walk a lot ,  they send other people to walk ,  the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed ,  but for no NOT_dramatic NOT_effect ,  simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere .  the editing is mind-bogglingly bad .  people actions make little sense .  for instance ,  when the professor goes to a farmer's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town ,  the farmer stutters and paces around .  when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside ,  the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later .  nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene ,  as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk .  the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film ,  but absolutely no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_to NOT_put NOT_that NOT_in NOT_motion .  i have seen better high school video productions .  finally ,  the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story .  i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage .  however ,  it is so awful in technical aspects ,  and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad .  avoid this film at all costs . 
1513 1 i have to say although i despise these kind of shows ,  shock horror ,  i'm a girl ,  i feel i have to express my opinion .  i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making .  story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show .  i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was ,  everything just put in a line joke after joke with no NOT_relation NOT_between NOT_anything .  it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever ,  shockingly amateur .  while drinking puke isn't NOT_really NOT_my NOT_thing ,  as far as a substantial entertainment show goes ,  dirty sanchez is way out of jackass's league . 
1514 0 my children watch the show everyday that its on .  its a great program for younger children .  however they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooney's and deedee's yellow teeth .  moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't NOT_ever NOT_brush NOT_their NOT_teeth? NOT_does NOT_the NOT_show NOT_ever NOT_make NOT_its NOT_way NOT_to NOT_the NOT_united NOT_states NOT_and NOT_if NOT_so NOT_where NOT_can NOT_we NOT_find NOT_its NOT_schedule NOT_at .  and one other thing if we might be able to add .  moe you need to stop hiding so much .  sometimes when you pop up out of no NOT_where NOT_you NOT_scare NOT_the NOT_younger NOT_children NOT_and NOT_whats NOT_with NOT_the NOT_pulling NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rope? NOT_what NOT_does NOT_that NOT_signify? NOT_other NOT_then NOT_getting NOT_wet NOT_all NOT_the NOT_time .  they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole .  kids loose interest that way . 
1515 1 i need to be honest .  i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross ,  offensive ,  hilarious ,  and raunchy .  yeah ,  there is a lot of humor for all tastes .  if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards ,  for example then you will have a great time for it . <br /><br />or ,  if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad ,  you will also have a great time .  and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh  ,  you will enjoy the show . <br /><br />i enjoy all three kinds of humor that "dirty sã nchez" offers .  i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show .  "jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one .  so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass ,  give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show .  with all due respect . <br /><br />this is a show that has little taste or class .  it's not NOT_recommended NOT_for NOT_those NOT_who NOT_are NOT_easily NOT_offended NOT_or NOT_grossed NOT_out . <br /><br />now ,  these guys need to see a psychologist .  specially the paco character . 
1516 0 this show stinks .  for parents ,  they usually want their kids to watch something good for them .  it is usually educational ,  funny ,  and bright . <br /><br />is it educational? no .  the doodlebops sing and that's it .  they usually sing about themselves ,  they don't NOT_try NOT_teaching NOT_anything . <br /><br />is it funny? no .  the doodlebops instead say something which is not NOT_intended NOT_as NOT_a NOT_joke ,  and laugh at it . <br /><br />is it bright? it's so bright ,  it's painful .  as far as color , s everything is extremely bright ,  so that's good .  but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop's .  therefore ,  they are always happy .  a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never NOT_been NOT_exposed NOT_to NOT_being NOT_sad . <br /><br />the show is also extremely cheesy .  every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny .  it's overkill . <br /><br />for kids ,  it's entertaining ,  but past the age of 2 you won't NOT_want NOT_your NOT_kids NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it .  they'll never NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_grow NOT_up . 
1517 1 i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass ,  and i saw one or two episodes on freeview ,  and it is the same ,  only more extreme .  basically three welsh guys ,  and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding ,  and a complete disregard/masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety .  they have had puking ,  eating pubes-covered pizza ,  jumping in stinging nettles ,  naked paint balling ,  jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring ,  stunts in a work place ,  e . g .  army ,  cowboys ,  and many more insane stunts that cause bruises ,  bumps ,  blood and vomit ,  maybe not NOT_just NOT_for NOT_themselves .  starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything ,  lee dainton also up for just about anything ,  dan joyce (the british one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh ,  and pancho (mike locke) who does a lot ,  but is more popular for being short ,  fat and lazy .  it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments .  very good!

1519 1 to many people ,  beat street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culture . <br /><br />the young lee is living in ny in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning .  his a crew member of "beat street" -a b-boy crew .  the movie follows lee in his average day ,  dancing ,  graffitiing ,  etc . <br /><br />the director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world .  the movie has old school features such as<br /><br />afrika bambaataa & the soul sonic force ,  grandmaster melle mel & the furious five ,  the rock steady crew ,  the new york city breakers ,  and many more .  .  .  . <br /><br />neither the movie beat street nor the beat street spirit will ever die . 
1520 0 an uninspired and undistinguished "new" columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding ,  only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night .  columbo investigates .  .  . <br /><br />and that it is about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script ,  given that it is written by robert van scoyk ,  who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story "murder under glass" in the detective's heyday; there is not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_murder NOT_to NOT_speak NOT_of NOT_and NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_amount NOT_of NOT_ingenuity NOT_afforded NOT_to NOT_columbo NOT_by NOT_the NOT_script-writer NOT_is NOT_the NOT_narrowing NOT_down NOT_of NOT_suspects NOT_via NOT_the NOT_photos NOT_taken NOT_at NOT_the NOT_wedding ,  which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />devoid of every columbo trait possible ,  i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues .  an insult to the history of the series ,  with appropriately soap-opera style acting .  very avoidable stuff . 
1521 1 i had not NOT_seen NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_since NOT_the NOT_late NOT_'80s NOT_and NOT_decided NOT_to NOT_pick NOT_up NOT_the NOT_vhs NOT_version NOT_of NOT_it .  the plot is very slow ,  and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick .  the music ,  hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special .  the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "breakin'" ,  but i have to say that "breakin' 1&2" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better .  it's a movie i will keep in my library ,  but it's not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_i NOT_can NOT_watch NOT_over NOT_& NOT_over NOT_again ,  just once in a blue moon . 
1522 0 absolute garbage .  the reason that this is so terrible is not NOT_because NOT_it NOT_deviated NOT_from NOT_the NOT_formula ,  but because the plot was just pathetic .  <br /><br />the supposed star didn't NOT_do NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_solve NOT_the NOT_case NOT_- NOT_and NOT_neither NOT_did NOT_anyone NOT_else NOT_really NOT_- NOT_it NOT_was NOT_just NOT_routine NOT_police NOT_work .  utterly tedious . <br /><br />you sat right till the end hoping for a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment .  <br /><br />there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap .  could the lt's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement? <br /><br />all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it .  but surely a genius like lt c ,  by constant conversation with the wronged husband ,  would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride ,  hides the body and then plants subtle clues .  it could have been good .  it was a complete waste of time . 
1523 1 i just wanna say that amongst all the so-called classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style ,  krushgroove ,  breakin' ,  style wars etc .  .  .  imo beat street is the best amongst the others .  whenever i ask other people about which is their fave ,  then it seems that beat street pops out the most .  but still ,  its the lowest ranked of all .  4 . 3 is just a punch "under the belt" (if say ,  5 points is the belt) .  i love the music performances ,  the breakdancing makes me wanna spin ,  ramo makes me wanna throw a piece .  .  . c'mon ,  its a classic!!! 
1524 0 loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the (1) it deserved .  (for that matter ,  loyalty to mr .  falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails . ) even if you forgive all the glaring errors ,  this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made-for-tv "columbo" film ever .  i'm glad i watched it on tv for free; would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print . 
1525 1 i enjoy watching people doing breakdance ,  especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called "roxy" .  especially at christmas time ,  because there also appears a "mc santa claus" . <br /><br />even if this is an old film ,  and even if i have videotaped it from tv ,  when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen ,  i went there to check it out .  it's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tv . <br /><br />even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost ,  i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket ,  i got the money's worth by seeing this ,  as it is on big screen ,  especially seated on front row of the cinema ,  an unforgettable experience ,  and much better than just on video . 
1526 0 i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot .  a mind-bogglingly tedious ,  pointless ,  muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored-looking peter falk .  the 'plot' ,  such as it is ,  just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not NOT_even NOT_the NOT_slightest NOT_hint NOT_of NOT_the NOT_ingredients NOT_to NOT_the NOT_formula NOT_that NOT_made NOT_the NOT_show NOT_such NOT_a NOT_brilliant NOT_success NOT_to NOT_start NOT_with .  one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was peter falk's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'lt' columbo .  if the producers insist on keeping columbo's first name a secret ,  why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous? like i said ,  this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague . 
1527 1 this movie changed it all for me .  .  . i heard of breakdancing and hiphop ,  but had never NOT_seen NOT_it NOT_professionally NOT_done NOT_(hey NOT_i NOT_was NOT_an NOT_11-year NOT_old NOT_kid NOT_from NOT_holland!) NOT_when NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_this NOT_movie ,  this all changed .  i got actively involved in the hiphop-movement in our city ,  started breakdancing and writing lyrics . <br /><br />to this day ,  i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite .  sure ,  the filming and "cinematographic" importance might not NOT_be NOT_that NOT_significant .  but who cares if the wide-shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody? it's what it does to you personally that counts .  .  . 
1528 0 the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera .  deeply character-driven films are great ,  but only if the characters are compelling .  and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel .  the villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist .  the great lt .  columbo himself is no NOT_where NOT_near NOT_his NOT_famous ,  lovable ,  self-effacing ,  crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering ,  one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!! i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds) .  in any sense of reality ,  this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little .  and speaking of reality .  .  .  . the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police .  the police?? give me a break .  everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case .  this was no NOT_columbo ,  just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt .  columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours . 
1529 1 without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene .  everything about it is spot on , the clothes (puma) , the music and most importantly the dancing! the storyline is basic , but hey whats there to tell a story about? the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing , what mattered to them .  it shows that teenagers in general are good , all that mattered to these everyday kids was music , dancing and friendship .  having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time! the clothes didn't NOT_look NOT_dated NOT_(possibly NOT_because NOT_puma NOT_is NOT_now NOT_having NOT_a NOT_massive NOT_comeback) , the music still sounds fresh , and the dancing is still captivating to watch .  a film anyone 10-25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture . 
1530 0 seriously what were they thinking? over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it .  this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_good NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie . <br /><br />main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no NOT_murder NOT_being NOT_committed .  the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation .  also the overall is just totally different and more 'modernized' . <br /><br />director alan j .  levi did some other columbo movies in the past ,  which all very much sticked to the usual formula .  it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie . <br /><br />the columbo character himself also feels quite different ,  perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation ,  when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding .  the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesn't NOT_exactly NOT_make NOT_this NOT_a NOT_good NOT_or NOT_enjoyable NOT_watch . <br /><br />in all honesty ,  the movie doesn't NOT_begin NOT_too NOT_bad NOT_but NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_starts NOT_to NOT_become NOT_more NOT_and NOT_more NOT_ridicules NOT_with NOT_its NOT_story NOT_as NOT_it NOT_progresses .  it's such a stupid written kidnap-thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely .  it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable .  this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesn't NOT_know NOT_to NOT_entertain NOT_its NOT_viewers NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way . <br /><br />it also doesn't NOT_help NOT_much NOT_that NOT_the NOT_supporting NOT_actors NOT_aren't NOT_the NOT_most NOT_talented NOT_ones NOT_around .  despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style ,  peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie .  can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him? it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you . <br /><br />an odd columbo entry ,  which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula . <br /><br />4/10 
1531 1 i guess when "beat street" made a national appearance ,  "flashdance" came at the same time .  the problem with "flashdance" is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet .  that was one of the reasons why "beat street" was better .  the only movie that could rival "beat street" seems to be "footloose" ,  because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings . <br /><br />the break-dance scenes in "beat street" come just before the middle and at the end of the flick .  and i loved all of them .  almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes: the jackhammer ,  the flares ,  the head spins ,  the suicide sit ,  the crazy legs ,  the mortal ,  the forward flip ,  the figure four---almost everything . <br /><br />like "the warriors" ,  "beat street" does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world .  .  . but in a much less violent way than the former .  the only major fight scene in "beat street" was when graffiti artist ramon (which in the movie was abbreviated as "ramo") is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks .  .  .  .  . fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail .  well ,  although that chase scene ended tragically ,  it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot . <br /><br />most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture ,  and rap music .  a lot of rap music appeared in the flick ,  because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life .  even the theme song of the movie ,  which closed the curtain to the flick ,  was not NOT_just NOT_an NOT_homage NOT_to NOT_hip-hop NOT_culture--it NOT_also NOT_was NOT_an NOT_homage NOT_to NOT_the NOT_death NOT_of NOT_ramon . <br /><br />by the way ,  during the dance scene called 'tango ,  tango' ,  i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e .  making a cameo appearance . 
1532 0 whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime ,  columbo smokes out killer ,  columbo becomes a pest in the process) ,  the writers somehow are never NOT_able NOT_to NOT_match NOT_the NOT_quality NOT_and NOT_interest NOT_of NOT_most NOT_traditional NOT_episodes .  this episode deviates in the extreme ,  and the result is a major flop . <br /><br /> would you believe: columbo never NOT_faces NOT_the NOT_villain NOT_till NOT_the NOT_very NOT_end?!!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>frankly ,  i was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through . <br /><br /> oh ,  the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make!!! 
1533 1 this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york .  what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life ,  for american youth .  what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause? one of the most important movies of all time .  the elements are simple yet fascinating .  the story is timeless ,  young people try to succeed against all odds .  yet the story is always believable and never NOT_depressing .  the characters are so realistic ,  a city dweller ,  would recognize them as neighbors .  the story is entertaining ,  and comes to a satisfying ending .  buy this one for your permanent collection .  it is a piece of american history .

1535 1 being that i am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation ,  this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time .  beat street ,  although not NOT_as NOT_"authentic" NOT_in NOT_some NOT_respects NOT_as NOT_wild NOT_style ,  is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/dj-based music and electro-club culture . <br /><br />although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy ,  you can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_feel NOT_for NOT_the NOT_characters ,  and ultimately "wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in new york city in the early eighties .  the b-boy battle scene at the roxy nightclub (a real-life ,  real-time competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc breakers) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan's archives as any classic album .  watch some of the breakers' moves in slow-motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned b-boy/b-girl .  all praises due to the zulu nation!!! 
1536 0 i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format .  columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods .  this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past .  and that is the disturbing point ,  because columbo is no NOT_ordinary NOT_detective . <br /><br />there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing .  first ,  i can't NOT_figure NOT_out NOT_the NOT_title NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie .  it is misleading .  maybe a better title would've been "the vanishing bride" or something similar .  second ,  columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it . <br /><br />i don't NOT_feel NOT_betrayed ,  just disappointed .  i'm glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo . <br /><br /> 
1537 1 cinematically ,  this film stinks .  so does a lot of the acting .  but i<br /><br />don't care .  if there is a strong representation of what the 80's were<br /><br />like(for a lot of us in the innercity anyways) and what hip-hop ,  zulu<br /><br />nation ,  and break dancing were really like . great music ,  great<br /><br />dancing! it almost seems like a documentary of a time now past<br /><br />when hip-hop was a way of life .  it's also interesting to see new<br /><br />york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack .  some viewers<br /><br />may be too young to remember that it was a poor ,  run down city<br /><br />during the 70's and 80's .  this is the best of all the hip-hop/break<br /><br />dancing movies that came out around that period .  of course the<br /><br />80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and<br /><br />movies ,  but those of us who lived through it will always remember<br /><br />it fondly for a time when music ,  dancing ,  and graffiti were fresh ,  yo! 
1538 0 the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth .  hearing david lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous "tomorrow ,  tomorrow ,  and tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role .  i kept believing therefore that he didn't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_part NOT_because NOT_he NOT_was NOT_a NOT_lousy NOT_actor; NOT_not NOT_because NOT_a NOT_bigger NOT_name NOT_was NOT_available .  then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not NOT_parodying NOT_things NOT_with NOT_a NOT_hopelessly NOT_miscast ,  misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations .  sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works)that they settle for less .  this appears to be such an example . 
1539 1 of all the breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986 ,  the 1984 film beat street is unquestionably the best one .  the story follows a dj ,  his younger breakdancing brother ,  a graffiti artist and a wanna-be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their "street" talent .  the acting isn't NOT_always NOT_up NOT_to NOT_par NOT_and NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_aren't NOT_fully NOT_drawn NOT_out ,  but they are more than compensated for by down-to-earth dialogue ,  a plausible story ,  fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip-hop sound track .  it should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ("this ain't NOT_new NOT_york ,  this is the bronx!") ,  and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing ,  dance troupe rock steady crew and rapper afrika bambaata .  rock steady crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80's ,  the roxy .  a must see for hip-hop lovers . 
1540 0 the stranger jack (matthew lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques max (vincent d'onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons jamie (valeria golino) that he is jack's brother .  jamie does not NOT_buy NOT_his NOT_story ,  dominates jack and ties him up to a chair .  when max arrives ,  jack proposes us$ 100 , 000 . 00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "spanish judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector .  max invites his stupid acquaintance piece (mark boone junior) ,  who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars ,  to compose the backup team .  however ,  jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues jack ,  jamie and piece . <br /><br />the low budget "spanish judges" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast .  valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent d'onofrio ,  they are not NOT_able NOT_to NOT_save NOT_the NOT_stupid NOT_story .  further ,  the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not NOT_work ,  and actually they are silly and not NOT_funny .  my vote is three . <br /><br />title (brazil): "tudo por dinheiro" ("all for money") 
1541 1 i love tudor chirila and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much .  two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert .  i saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and i thought i had it all figured .  .  i was wrong: instead of a good movie i assisted a great one! i felt the movie .  it was sad .  .  it was funny .  .  but most of all it pictured love .  .  i can't NOT_even NOT_begin NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_the NOT_soundtrack .  .  so i won't NOT_:) NOT_i'm NOT_not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_critic .  .  i can't NOT_describe NOT_it NOT_in NOT_more NOT_words .  .  my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless .  .  thank god for the keyboard :) thank you tudor giurgiu ,  thank you maria popistasu ,  thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila .  encore! :) 
1542 0 although the director tried(the filming was made in tynisia and morocco) , this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen failed . the script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies , while the duration is very long . but the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon , who doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_demands NOT_of NOT_his NOT_role . 
1543 1 i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend ,  my wife and her female friend .  so i had views from all kinds of directions .  mainly ,  the film made me laugh ,  the sexual tension was not NOT_really NOT_there NOT_and NOT_the NOT_only NOT_noticeable NOT_actors NOT_were NOT_tudor NOT_chirila NOT_and NOT_maria NOT_popistasu .  yes ,  i do think she played her role well ,  even if the script was not NOT_appropriate .  there were good romanian actors around ,  they just didn't NOT_have NOT_complex NOT_roles .  i applaud puya's entering the movie business .  i don't NOT_know NOT_why ,  but i think he's a good guy ,  i just hope he'll be a good actor . <br /><br />the wife loved the movie ,  though ,  and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no NOT_ear NOT_for .  if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania ,  then it failed miserably .  there were no NOT_consequences .  just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl ,  and the same story becomes just a boring ,  uninteresting plot . <br /><br />i have no NOT_idea NOT_why NOT_it NOT_got NOT_all NOT_those NOT_bafta NOT_awards .  in my book ,  it should have gotten the "better luck next time" award .  (bafta=good luck in romanian) . 
1544 0 this movie is not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_all NOT_the NOT_movies NOT_of NOT_christ NOT_i've NOT_ever NOT_seen .  and i'm quite amazed that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus ,  when the scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently .  it lacks also a very important issue: the resurrection .  .  none of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event .  as paul says in one of his letters "if christ did not NOT_rise NOT_from NOT_the NOT_dead ,  our faith is vain" .  a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem .  <br /><br />finally ,  and in opposition to my jewish co-commentator ,  jesus was not NOT_a NOT_myth .  and as a matter of fact ,  he was also a jew .  there are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should i said ,  god become a man) that indeed changed mankind .  i strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about flavius josephus ,  the most brilliant jewish commentator of the 1st .  century . 
1545 1 love is overwhelming .  .  .  in all it's manifestations .  .  .  gorgeous ,  absolutely gorgeous .  .  .  tudor chirila ,  maria popistasu and ioana barbu ,  one truly dramatic story about love in all it's shapes ,  a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts ,  about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu .  with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline & chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love .  .  .  truly remarkable .  .  .  is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect? this is a brilliant film .  .  .  two thumbs up to everybody involved . 
1546 0 no ,  not NOT_the NOT_administration NOT_of NOT_gwb ,  the decider/strutter/smirker--but the mini-series "monarch cove . " lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time ,  most of them broadcast between 11 p . m .  friday nights and 1 a . m .  saturday mornings .  as to why i watched the whole thing ,  i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism . <br /><br />most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown .  the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward ,  who turn in the only decent performances (jones doesn't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_through NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_series--lucky NOT_woman) .  ward ,  by the way ,  is aging quite well since her "thorn birds" days . <br /><br />the one main thread to the plot--who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dad's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer--is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won't NOT_especially NOT_care NOT_who NOT_dun NOT_it .  there is a great deal of "steamy" sex ,  several murders ,  and all sorts of rude behavior--virtually none of which is either interesting or credible .  most of the cast is not NOT_particularly NOT_attractive NOT_and NOT_definitely NOT_not NOT_talented .  the writing and direction is on a par with the cast . <br /><br />if you stick around to the end ,  the post card is a (very minor)hoot . <br /><br />consider yourself warned! 
1547 1 i expected something different:more passion , drama .  .  . again another failed attempt of originality . i'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clichã© of 'cheesiness' . 15 year old teens may appreciate it though . the acting was not NOT_very NOT_convincing NOT_and NOT_the NOT_lines NOT_common , lacking any wit . still ,  the soundtrack was good and well adapted . i can't NOT_say NOT_that NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_a NOT_total NOT_flop , because people do watch it but it didn't NOT_meet NOT_the NOT_public's NOT_expectations NOT_and NOT_sunk NOT_into NOT_mediocrity . so , to conclude , the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half , which is an appreciable thing . thus , i guess its worth seeing if you don't NOT_get NOT_annoyed 
1548 0 this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never NOT_had NOT_made NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_before NOT_nor NOT_had NOT_they NOT_considered NOT_that NOT_a NOT_script NOT_should NOT_be NOT_edited NOT_or NOT_even NOT_funny .  when i saw this film ,  i saw it for john candy and assumed ,  incorrectly ,  that it would be hilarious .  instead ,  there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat ,  unfunny moments .  and ,  to top it off ,  candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time .  so ,  despite a potentially funny cast and story idea ,  we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult ,  though teens will probably find a few laughs .  it's really a shame--it could have been so much better .  i mean ,  with eugene levy ,  joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful .

1550 0 john candy .  need we say more? he is the main reason you should see this film .  most people don't NOT_realize NOT_how NOT_gifted NOT_he NOT_was NOT_as NOT_an NOT_actor .  witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk .  just a simple(subtle) facial change and off we go .  there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits .  the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when john(in a trance) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend-that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend .  i'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude .  it is ,  but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit .  the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flaherty(both sctv alumni with candy) are not NOT_given NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_do NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film .  levy has his moments ,  especially filming the wedding at the end(think rod serling) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone .  overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid .  i give this one 4 out of 10 . 
1551 1 it's a strange ,  yet somehow impressive story ,  about love .  personnaly ,  i never NOT_run NOT_over NOT_such NOT_a NOT_twist-off NOT_story NOT_in NOT_real NOT_life .  but ,  i can image there is . <br /><br />it's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title .  but ,  after i watch it ,  i didn't NOT_get NOT_this NOT_feeling NOT_of NOT_"sickness" NOT_which NOT_i NOT_would NOT_surely NOT_have NOT_regarding NOT_society NOT_rules .  it's something beautiful in this movie .  .  .  something impressive .  .  . which i cannot contradict using any moral or society rules . <br /><br />the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex .  you can see how this relation starts ,  evolves and finally ends .  you feel the moment when this love blossoms ,  the first whispers ,  touchings .  you feel the connection .  and no NOT_moment NOT_i NOT_though NOT_this NOT_is NOT_immoral .  you even hope it will not NOT_break NOT_in NOT_the NOT_end .  .  .  . it cannot break .  .  . it's not NOT_right .  you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end .  .  . <br /><br />but , i need also to add a negative spin to this comment .  .  . i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_the NOT_story NOT_is NOT_not NOT_somehow NOT_*showed* NOT_to NOT_give NOT_the NOT_feeling NOT_that NOT_these NOT_relations NOT_are NOT_sick NOT_only NOT_in NOT_form ,  but not NOT_in NOT_content .  you don't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_total NOT_story ,  but only fragments .  when movie has started ,  the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place .  so ,  no NOT_clue NOT_about NOT_the NOT_nature NOT_of NOT_the NOT_relation .  you feel only a tension between them .  .  . a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation .  i think this line of kiki to sandu says all: "i want to stop .  .  . and if you love me ,  you will do as i ask you" . <br /><br />this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral .  .  . and where's the limit between them .  i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_the NOT_idea NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_"love NOT_conquers NOT_all .  .  . even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful .  .  . no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_or NOT_where" .  but in my opinion ,  this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think .  .  . 
1552 0 i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7 .  my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall .  i remember that it really sucked .  the plot had no NOT_sense .  i hated the fox that became casper's friend .  he was so stupid! casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend .  so what? get over it! the only good part and i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_sound NOT_mean-spirited NOT_was NOT_when NOT_the NOT_fox NOT_got NOT_shot NOT_and NOT_died NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end .  i laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much .  the bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost .  i wish he had stayed dead .  i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it .  no NOT_wonder NOT_they NOT_were NOT_offering NOT_it NOT_for NOT_free NOT_at NOT_the NOT_mall .  if you have a child don't NOT_let NOT_them NOT_watch NOT_this .  they will probably agree with me that it sucks . 
1553 1 i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second ,  as someone else wrote in a comment ,  the implications of this kind of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in the romanian society . <br /><br />so .  .  .  to begin with the second aspect .  .  .  to make it short ,  it wasn't NOT_visible NOT_at NOT_all .  .  . <br /><br />as for the first .  .  as i said ,  it had much more potential .  .  .  i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension .  .  .  much more tension .  .  .  and the potential tension didn't NOT_get NOT_through .  .  . <br /><br />i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme (wich was nice but not NOT_enough NOT_and NOT_not NOT_always NOT_in NOT_the NOT_right NOT_moments) .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack .  . <br /><br />the actors .  .  .  i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 .  .  .  not NOT_enough NOT_sensuality NOT_in NOT_the NOT_key NOT_moments .  .  . <br /><br />a total of 7/10 .  .  .  .  mostly for the story 
1554 0 i can not NOT_believe NOT_such NOT_slanted ,  jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material .  early on ,  from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting ,  a love divided shows it's true face .  the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic ,  the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden ,  is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians .  the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent ,  so far from attempting art .  this film has no NOT_business NOT_being NOT_anywhere NOT_in NOT_any NOT_legitimate NOT_cinema NOT_or NOT_library . 
1555 1 i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival .  to pick up on the previous reviewer's remarks ,  the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space ,  drab architecture ,  overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe .  a bit shabby housing project style is how i'd describe it ,  and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities .  i can't NOT_say NOT_that NOT_i'm NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_bucharest ,  romania where the action unfolded ,  but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months .  <br /><br />when i visited russia as a student for a semester ,  my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building ,  just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman ,  because the elevators weren't NOT_working .  but ,  i do concur with the reviewer ,  that the claustrophobia and muted colors ,  it's overdone ,  for there are ,  to be sure ,  beautiful historic buildings ,  parks ,  squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe ,  and bucharest's didn't NOT_get NOT_much NOT_of NOT_any NOT_footage NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half-year stay there ,  feeling trapped and limited .  (it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life ,  just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto . ) <br /><br />also ,  given the climate of homophobia ,  say ,  circa ,  us in the 1980s ,  the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter; hence ,  the focus on their interaction in the apartment . <br /><br />it's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania ,  and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing .  it's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film ,  and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources .  the actors were fairly good and believable; the dialog was overall well done ,  and i could identity with these women . <br /><br />the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women ,  kiki ,  an energetic ,  fun-loving free spirit with a dark ,  troubling secret (her admiration and love for an abusive ,  incestuous brother ,  sandu) falls in love with alexandra ,  a bright ,  bookish ,  idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies .  opposites attract ,  and their personalities seem to complement one another ,  though there is some tension between the ambitious ,  studious ,  intellectual alexandra and kiki ,  who seems to be attending college to please her parents .  keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable ,  though we don't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_the NOT_tension NOT_it NOT_requires ,  nor do we ever see or meet any other students--hard to believe--and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed .  the chief threat to their love is kiki's brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him .  but kiki's love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond ,  or does it? that's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops ,  and i won't NOT_say NOT_how NOT_it NOT_concludes . <br /><br />ironically ,  kiki's love "sickness" isn't NOT_love NOT_for NOT_another NOT_woman ,  but her illicit ,  incestuous love for her brother .  thus ,  loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling .  <br /><br />though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic ,  overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra ,  it was still engaging and moving to watch ,  so i'll give it a 7 . 
1556 0 what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way? this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches: unctuous priests ,  spitting before handshakes ,  town square cattle marts ,  cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music .  quickly ,  however ,  it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy-o of irish cliches - religous strife .  it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic-fathered child is educated ,  which would seem like a reasonable enough wish ,  though not NOT_to NOT_the NOT_'50's NOT_county NOT_wexford NOT_villagers NOT_she NOT_has NOT_to NOT_live NOT_with .  rather than send them to a catholic school ,  she decides to up and leave for belfast ,  then scotland ,  where a few more cliches are reguritated .  while she's there ,  her father (who looks eerily like george lucas) and family back home are subjected to a boycott ,  which turns very nasty .  i'm not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_give NOT_away NOT_the NOT_ending ,  not NOT_because NOT_i NOT_think NOT_people NOT_should NOT_go NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie ,  but because it's not NOT_very NOT_interesting .  one of the problems with the film is the central character: we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life .  the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to ,  but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it .  in addition ,  it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she "must lay down preconditions" for her return .  the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively ,  and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches ,  in the past . 
1557 1 i'm not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_an NOT_expert NOT_on NOT_acting NOT_or NOT_other NOT_movie NOT_details ,  but this movie just hit me deep .  i don't NOT_think NOT_i'll NOT_ever NOT_forget NOT_it .  one scene especially (i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking) is imprinted on my brain . <br /><br />i also watched the similar movie lilja 4-ever (as referred to by a previous commentator) .  it was also very moving ,  but not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_straight NOT_to NOT_the NOT_point NOT_and NOT_brutal .  if you are sensitive at all ,  either will bring tears to your eyes ,  but anjos do sol (angels of the sun) may stay with you forever . <br /><br />this is very depressing subject matter ,  but i think ,  no ,  i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it . <br /><br />more people need to see this film!!!!!! 
1558 0 seriously ,  i mean very seriously ,  when i first started watching the show i thought it was good .  but the plots just got worse .  the storyline were either too boring or predictable .  george isn't NOT_always NOT_funny ,  he sometimes acts stupid .  his jokes are overdone .  his mom is the silliest character of the show .  how can a mother treat her own son that way ,  okay if it was the daughter in law ,  but this was her own son .  i give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny .  the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job .  don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_these NOT_shows NOT_get NOT_to NOT_play NOT_for NOT_so NOT_long .  <br /><br />if you're really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch ,  i'd suggest you watch this . 
1559 1 in northeastern of brazil ,  the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria (fernanda carvalho) sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization ,  tadeu (chico dias) ,  to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life .  however ,  the girl is resold to the farmer lourenã§o (otã¡vio augusto) that deflowers her ,  and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience .  then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner ,  the despicable saraiva (antonio calloni) .  when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life ,  she is explored by the cã¡ften vera (darlene glã³ria) . <br /><br />"anjos do sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria .  last year i saw "lilja 4-ever" that tells an identical story in the former soviet union; therefore this problem does exist in third world countries .  director and writer rudi lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never NOT_showing NOT_nudity NOT_or NOT_explicit NOT_sexual NOT_scenes .  it is the debut of the promising fernanda carvalho ,  who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival .  most of the prostitutes are amateurs ,  and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glã³ria so different she is after many plastic surgeries .  the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic .  my vote is ten . <br /><br />title (brazil): "anjos do sol" ("angels of the sun") 
1560 0 this show is awful .  how is george wanting the death of his mother funny? this show is terrible .  the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services .  the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat .  george isn't NOT_funny ,  especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish .  ernie is a loser ,  but at least i've chuckled at him a few times ,  but mainly at how pathetic he is .  george's mother ,  benny ,  in an awful ,  despicable character .  sure ,  her husband left her ,  but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me . <br /><br />can someone explain to me how george's head being big is funny? it's not NOT_even NOT_that NOT_big! NOT_i've NOT_moved NOT_on NOT_from NOT_characters NOT_because NOT_they're NOT_too NOT_awful NOT_and NOT_it NOT_would NOT_take NOT_hours NOT_for NOT_me NOT_to NOT_write NOT_and NOT_i ,  frankly ,  don't NOT_care NOT_enough .  i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not NOT_they NOT_want NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_show ,  that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom ,  and is not NOT_worth NOT_your NOT_time . <br /><br />i give it 2 starts ,  because the wife is extremely attractive . 
1561 1 i think the weighted average for this film is too low .  i give it a 7 .  very entertaining ,  although over the top in a few places .  my wife says it passes the danielle steele test .  superb performances throughout ,  particularly by andie macdowell . 
1562 0 this show was absolutely terrible .  for one george isn't NOT_funny ,  and his kids are snobby little brats .  he also treats his mother with no NOT_respect .  as a hispanic ,  i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed . <br /><br />plus the dysfunctional family thing's been done to death .  for once ,  i want to see something original .  what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air ,  but sadly ,  we're going to have to stomach this until they "jump the shark" . <br /><br />in my opinion ,  they already did . 
1563 1 "crush" examines female friendship ,  for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme (e .  g .  ,  "steel magnolias") .  at the same time ,  it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise .  the events depicted were highly improbable ,  but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me .  not NOT_a NOT_film NOT_for NOT_the NOT_speeding-vehicle-and-explosion NOT_crowd ,  but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears . 
1564 0 outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk ,  his show is terrible . <br /><br />nothing about lopez has ever been funny .  i have watched his stand-up and have never NOT_uttered NOT_any NOT_resemblance NOT_to NOT_a NOT_laugh . <br /><br />his stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body . <br /><br />i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them . <br /><br />this guy has a grudge that won't NOT_end . <br /><br />i feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves . <br /><br />the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent . <br /><br />canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes . <br /><br />might be why this show is always on at 2am in replay . 
1565 1 this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town .  one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor ,  when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever .  definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you! a powerful piece of work .  this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time . <br /><br />*spoiler!!! spoiler alert!! spoiler!!*<br /><br />the main character is taken by her young ,  handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms .  her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy .  she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop .  in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together . (in my opinion her forgiveness is not NOT_warranted) 
1566 0 i watched this show and i simply didn't NOT_find NOT_it NOT_funny NOT_at NOT_all .  it might have been the first episode .  lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station .  all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors ,  but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down .  i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled ,  but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing ,  they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them . 
1567 1 the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is "beauty" .  beauty is all around ,  in actors' play (andie is superb as always) ,  in well designed shots ,  and in authors' red line idea - the love . <br /><br />i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life .  his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be .  when he's gone ,  it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires . <br /><br />the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad ,  instead it shows that life prevails in any forms ,  even in this small british village ,  which is shown perfectly . <br /><br />another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways - all that houses and "fags" and accents :))) .  and andie again is doing superb job! it is a shame that this movie got such low marks .  10 out of ten! 
1568 0 despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals ,  this movie is not NOT_for NOT_everyone . <br /><br />the story is very similar to other movies ,  in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age ,  and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family .  she does that by choosing some kind of sport ,  and with the help of a local boy ,  that for some reason falls in love with her ,  she confronts her problems and wins . <br /><br />in girlfight it's boxing ,  in bend it like beckham it's soccer ,  and now it's kung fu . <br /><br />but fighter is much inferior product than these two ,  it was simply embarrassing to watch it .  semra turan ,  the "actress" that playing the role of a teenage girl ,  maybe can do a lot of things ,  but one thing she can't NOT_do NOT_is NOT_to NOT_act .  her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy ,  the dramatic situations ,  in which she tries to show some emotions ,  are dreadful ,  her body and facial language are of amateur actress ,  badly instructed by the director .  the rest of the cast is a little better ,  but they just cannot save this clichã© movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot .  besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer . <br /><br />even the kung fu fighting is not NOT_a NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this ,  it's just so boring .  the slow motion was really unnecessary ,  the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration ,  and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions ,  not NOT_actually NOT_fighting .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_how NOT_ridiculous NOT_it NOT_looks NOT_when NOT_a NOT_small NOT_and NOT_skinny NOT_girl NOT_fights NOT_big NOT_and NOT_muscular NOT_boys ,  and knocks them off their feet .  <br /><br />the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's european .  it's very easy to publicize this movie - a first martial arts film from denmark ,  but don't NOT_be NOT_fooled ,  it's not .  it's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems ,  which are ,  by the way ,  not NOT_really NOT_convincing . <br /><br />bad movie with embarrassing lines ,  acting and story . 
1569 1 well ,  i thoroughly enjoyed this movie .  it was funny and sad and yes ,  the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot .  interesting ,  realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery .  i think my mum would like it .  i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f**kers club though .  .  . 
1570 0 this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of "hamlet" to ever reach the screen .  branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket ,  having fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of "monty python and the holy grail") when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco (who shouts the very un-shakespearean cry of "ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack" before being gunned down) ,  and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagney's bottom and mary pickford's kate . <br /><br />branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text ,  so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no NOT_sense NOT_in NOT_the NOT_context NOT_that NOT_it NOT_is NOT_being NOT_performed .  and branagh does not NOT_concern NOT_himself NOT_with NOT_such NOT_textural NOT_subtleties NOT_as NOT_the NOT_ambiguous NOT_nature NOT_of NOT_hamlet NOT_and NOT_olphelia's NOT_relationship ,  treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window . <br /><br />the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of kenneth branagh .  this is never NOT_so NOT_apparent NOT_as NOT_in NOT_the NOT_"how NOT_all NOT_occasions NOT_inform NOT_against NOT_me" NOT_speech NOT_that NOT_ends NOT_the NOT_first NOT_half NOT_of NOT_the NOT_nineteen NOT_hour NOT_film NOT_(at NOT_least NOT_that's NOT_how NOT_it NOT_feels) ,  which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the wind's "i'll never NOT_be NOT_hungry NOT_again . " this may serve branagh's ego ,  but it does not NOT_serve NOT_shakespeare NOT_or NOT_the NOT_speech: NOT_when NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_the NOT_film NOT_in NOT_the NOT_theater ,  i leaned over to my companion and snickered "great moments with mr .  hamlet . " branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last ,  when he attempts to out-do the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch ,  impaling him with a sword .  branagh's dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye .  the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny . <br /><br />while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy ,  it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism .  the emperor has no NOT_clothes ,  and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control . 
1571 1 me being of irish origins ,  loved this movie ,  not NOT_only NOT_was NOT_the NOT_guy NOT_hot NOT_and NOT_funny NOT_he NOT_was NOT_also NOT_sincere NOT_and NOT_honest .  i loved the girl who he fell in love with too ,  she was pretty .  they were such a cute couple .  the ending was so sad .  love this movie! although it is a little dirty ,  it reminds of a british or irish version of prime .  if you liked this movie you should watch prime .  same story line young guy falls for older women ,  older women falls for young guy to .  a lot of paths cross ,  in the end ,  the best decision is made or task is completed .  don't NOT_have NOT_anything NOT_else NOT_to NOT_say ,  without ruining the whole movie ,  all though i thought the french guy was ugly ,  less appealing to me .  umm .  .  . if you like irish movies ,  i would recommend "circle of friends"  , that movie is so good .  quick quote ,  you might not NOT_get NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_watch NOT_it" NOT_well ,  thats my dinner ruined .

1572 0 i saw this film on its release ,  and have watched it 3 or 4 more times ,  including last week .  i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr .  branagh's performance . <br /><br />this is really a glorious ,  sumptuous film ,  to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designed .  derek jacobi ,  julie christie ,  kate winslet ,  richard briers ,  and many others do fine jobs .  then there's kenneth branagh .  if ever there was a vanity project for an actor ,  this is it ,  and mr .  branagh spares nothing in putting the "ham" in hamlet .  from the stunt casting (which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon) ,  to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of "naturalness , " to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others .  his performance confirms that ,  while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary ,  he has never NOT_been NOT_a NOT_great NOT_film NOT_actor .  the scenery budget could be charged to catering ,  mr .  branagh eats so much of it .  his performance is a perfect example of why people don't NOT_go NOT_to NOT_see NOT_shakespeare NOT_- NOT_"full NOT_of NOT_sound NOT_and NOT_fury ,  signifying nothing . " and if there is fault to his direction ,  it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance . <br /><br />no matter what theories people may posit on the bard ,  he was ,  after all is said and done ,  a playwright .  the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless .  although there is no NOT_"right" NOT_way NOT_to NOT_play NOT_his NOT_plays ,  there is most certainly great acting ,  good acting and bad acting .  shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of "hamlet" itself .  it amazes me how mr .  branagh "mouthed" it ,  but did not NOT_hear NOT_it .  it was an example of spending too much time working out how he's going to say something ,  and too little figuring out what he's saying . <br /><br />while mr .  branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions ,  he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it .  his direction has always been better than his acting .  i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare .  he set a great template for other productions .  and ,  it would be interesting to see him onstage ,  from about 20 rows back .  but ,  i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less . <br /><br />is it worth seeing? certainly .  there are many little joys to be found in the film .  but ,  it's a long ,  long movie and ,  by the end ,  one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it . 
1573 1 andie macdowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie .  when you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or all your life) you may feel you are wasting away .  the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active .  i liked the quick sexual encounter ,  which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (macdowell) .  her ex-student is cute enough ,  still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long .  <br /><br />there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical ,  though .  for example ,  at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man ,  would a mature police officer (the other friend of macdowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? is it so easy for anyone to not NOT_stop NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_a NOT_car? NOT_of NOT_course NOT_accidents NOT_happen NOT_all NOT_the NOT_time ,  but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with (that was the hardest part to believe!! for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long??) .  .  .  <br /><br />maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not NOT_last NOT_for NOT_long .  beside they know that a happy ending would not NOT_appeal NOT_to NOT_the NOT_public ,  especially to jealousy women over 40 ,  who are waiting some miracles to happen .  the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet ,  but if the man continued to live ,  would that last? for how long? nobody knows .  nonetheless ,  it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later .  .  .  .  a year later maybe . 
1574 0 as an inspiring director myself ,  this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind .  shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for dof .  the editing is good acting decent ,  sound effects aren't NOT_too NOT_over NOT_the NOT_top .  i would have give it a 7 for an indie film ,  but the story aren't NOT_that NOT_interesting .  it's more on the drama side ,  character developments than a horror flick . <br /><br />it's not NOT_for NOT_those NOT_who NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_get NOT_spooked NOT_startled NOT_frightened NOT_grossed NOT_out ,  or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy . <br /><br />honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's<br /><br />this movie is about a family who has a dry field ,  and that is just that . 
1575 1 i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends .  i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time .  it was just really touching .  although not NOT_a NOT_new NOT_concept NOT_this NOT_was NOT_a NOT_very NOT_well NOT_made NOT_film . 
1576 0 a film with very little positive to say for it . <br /><br />firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama . <br /><br />besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again .  i lost count of how many times i had seen "that" field at night or that bit of cracked earth . <br /><br />it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't NOT_know NOT_about NOT_things NOT_they NOT_will NOT_be NOT_gripped NOT_rather NOT_than NOT_just NOT_confused .  so with no NOT_signs NOT_that NOT_there NOT_are NOT_any NOT_issues NOT_we NOT_suddenly NOT_find NOT_the NOT_marriage NOT_is NOT_not NOT_what NOT_it NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be NOT_despite NOT_being NOT_given NOT_the NOT_impression NOT_that NOT_it's NOT_fine .  we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no NOT_time NOT_on NOT_the NOT_farm NOT_and NOT_also NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_have NOT_bought NOT_land NOT_with NOT_a NOT_wholly NOT_useless NOT_acre .  beth has a key to a warehouse of books? there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie ,  much later ,  in fact too late . <br /><br />and on the point of the acre .  horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not NOT_scary NOT_â– NOT_and NOT_also NOT_if NOT_they're NOT_meant NOT_to NOT_be NOT_an NOT_acre NOT_big NOT_then NOT_make NOT_them NOT_so . <br /><br />there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth (the best performer in the piece ,  followed by jefferson â– the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on "medication" . <br /><br />with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? he's six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene .  bad plinky plonk "horror" music fails to add atmosphere . <br /><br />often bad films can be amusing but not NOT_the NOT_empty NOT_acre ,  which is just bad . 
1577 1 ok - i admit .  i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks ,  the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable ,  but reasonable plot . <br /><br />starting out ,  we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie .  one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never NOT_married .  a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about .  the third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's . <br /><br />they are almost the "first wives club" ,  and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some "he left the credit card" behaviour .  characters set - the movie continues . <br /><br />mcdowell's character ,  the headmistress ,  arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist ,  filling in for the regular player (doughty) catches her eye .  what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief? will they live happily ever after?<br /><br />a tissue or two recommended if you're the teary type - the end uplifting ,  but maybe not NOT_what NOT_you'd NOT_expect .  all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action ,  special effects and schlock horror .

1579 1 crush provides a combination of drama ,  humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart .  mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in england .  all three professional women down-out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin ,  fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos .  andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british (which is where i find she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man .  small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends (great supporting cast) conflicts with her relationship .  unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness .  keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that .  this is the type of film you either love or hate ,  which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not NOT_that NOT_greatest NOT_success NOT_resulted NOT_when NOT_this NOT_film NOT_was NOT_released .  as i'm sure most are just unearthing the film now .  i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as "love actually" ,  and "three weddings and a funeral" .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_soundtrack NOT_is NOT_extraordinary NOT_perfectly NOT_capturing NOT_those NOT_crucial NOT_moments . 
1580 0 here is what happened:<br /><br />1) head of bbc3 needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to bbc1 and bbc2 to keep licence and job . <br /><br />2) lenny henry offers his unfunny friends up . <br /><br />3) head of bbc3 snaps them up ,  completely ignoring the fact that they are not NOT_funny . <br /><br />worst of all ,  it is arguably racist ,  as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes .  if a white person did this kind of thing ,  there'd be uproar!<br /><br />trash . 
1581 1 kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star ,  even though he keeps his pants on . <br /><br />the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life .  i don't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_can NOT_think NOT_of NOT_another NOT_movie ,  except perhaps zeffirelli's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well . <br /><br />the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously .  in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery ,  without the mayhem . <br /><br />this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages . 
1582 0 picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says "lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask him if he is black ,  then walk away" .  the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode .  more laughter .  now if you think the premise is funny ,  and the show contains many such types of situation ,  you will enjoy this show .  for the rest ,  use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry .  those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny .  another example of the humor in the show ,  a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier .  marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers? i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers ,  divulging why this comedy just is not NOT_funny NOT_at NOT_all .

1584 0 thanks to the bbc for this show .  i used to suffer from an inferiority complex ,  i hated leaving the house ,  talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me .  however after watching one episode of 4 non blondes my fortunes started to change .  after episode 2 i started applying for new jobs ,  wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented .  when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work ,  banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local .  if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't NOT_know NOT_where NOT_to NOT_turn NOT_then NOT_take NOT_a NOT_trip NOT_down NOT_to NOT_poundland NOT_and NOT_pick NOT_up NOT_the NOT_dvd NOT_it's NOT_only NOT_99p . 
1585 1 this is a refreshing ,  enjoyable movie .  if you enjoyed ,  "four weddings and a funeral" ,  "peter's friends" ,  etc .  ,  you will see a number of familiar and talented actors .  made me laugh ,  made me sad .  i view movies for entertainment ,  and english-set movies generally fit that bill for me .  enjoy! 
1586 0 i wasn't NOT_sure NOT_how NOT_to NOT_rate NOT_this NOT_movie ,  since it was so bad it was actually very funny .  i'm not NOT_a NOT_gackt NOT_fan NOT_by NOT_any NOT_means ,  though he is talented ,  despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball .  i always thought hyde was talented though ,  faith is an interesting album . <br /><br />but on topic here folks .  this movie is ridiculous .  it's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films . <br /><br />the movie has almost no NOT_plot NOT_here ,  except it's just about vampires with gangster friends .  in a way ,  this film almost reminded me of spider-man 3 ,  with how there were too many ideas ,  which resulted in not NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_to NOT_pay NOT_attention NOT_on NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them . <br /><br />the action scenes were laughable .  quickly edited ,  almost hard to understand ,  with choreography that's so laughably bad .  though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes ,  but that's this film's only such redemption .  i'm a sucker for good action movies ,  but the action was horribly done .  though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie . <br /><br />it keeps jumping between genres ,  not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_thing .  it wants to be a drama ,  or an action flick ,  or a horror ,  or a romance .  .  .  what the hell . <br /><br />if this review is making you mad ,  why? is it because gackt and hyde are your love? don't NOT_fool NOT_yourself ,  this movie is bad . 
1587 1 i really truly enjoyed this movie .  (which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site!) i am not NOT_saying NOT_that NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_cinematic NOT_masterpiece NOT_but NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_great NOT_way NOT_to NOT_spend NOT_a NOT_cold ,  snowy saturday night .  it is funny ,  poignant ,  and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others! (fess up ladies ,  we have all been there!) bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it .  (and truly ,  there is the best "wedding escape" that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film  .  .  .  more guts than anyone i have ever known!) you will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing  .  .  .  .  it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office .  (now i have to look around to purchase a copy!) 
1588 0 unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film ,  save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence . <br /><br />forget you ever stumbled upon this film and go watch something else . <br /><br />but if you insist on reading ,  consider: <br /><br />lame vehicle for japanese teen idol pretty-boys featuring nonsensical ,  convoluted "plot" that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you're ready to scream . <br /><br />nothing in this film makes sense .  it's an endless series of people expressing various emotions ,  from joy to anger ,  from happiness to tragedy ,  for no NOT_good NOT_reason .  we can obviously see something incredibly "dramatic" is happening ,  but we just don't NOT_give NOT_a NOT_crap NOT_why NOT_'cause NOT_there's NOT_no NOT_backstory . <br /><br />by the time this film is over ,  you will be sick and tired of these stupid ,  lanky ,  girly stars' faces .  you'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile ,  sneer ,  cry ,  look mysterious ,  be "serious , " and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces . <br /><br />that some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the "soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not NOT_tell NOT_you: NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>only NOT_the NOT_"converted , " mindless minions will like this film ,  the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous .  freud would have a field day . <br /><br />unless you're one of these mindless "fans , " stay the hell away from this abomination . 
1589 1 i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film .  i thought it was funny ,  sexy ,  painful ,  and warm .  andie macdowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable .  for once ,  the director of a macdowell film did not NOT_make NOT_her NOT_beauty NOT_another NOT_character NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film .  the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well .  her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life .  imelda stalinson ,  who has been a mvp in so many british films ,  does a great job in this .  there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting ,  clean direction ,  and witty writing . the film quality is excellent and the music is good ,  too ,  though unavailable on sound track . 
1590 0 when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co-stars ,  you expect to find a well done horror movie ,  but this was actually quite different ,  representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction .  karloff and lugosi both play scientists (rukh and benet respectively) - competitors to an extent ,  until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory .  the science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction ,  with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago . " in that pre historic time ,  a huge meteorite slammed into africa ,  leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "radium x" - which can heal and destroy .  a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa ,  on a search for the meteorite deposits ,  which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon ,  unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well . <br /><br />karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here .  lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well ,  although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in africa .  the story also plodded along a bit ,  and while it held my attention it didn't NOT_captivate NOT_me .  given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick ,  and that sci-fi was in its very early stages ,  i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack .  it was ok - nothing more ,  but also nothing less than that .  4/10 
1591 1 too bad a couple of comments before me don't NOT_know NOT_the NOT_facts NOT_of NOT_this NOT_case .  it is based on actual events ,  a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington ,  de/philadelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 .  i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period .  of course i immediately pointed out that the actress (who i really like in cold case) who played fahey looked nothing like her (anne marie was actually prettier) .  i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period .  details of the case were right on .  .  . no NOT_deviations NOT_of NOT_dramatic NOT_effect .  .  . even down to the carpet ,  gun ,  furniture ,  and cooler .  in conclusion ,  i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions (a good man ,  despite being a politician) and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime .  guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars . 
1592 0 a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station .  antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and .  .  . that's about it .  for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world . 
1593 1 thomas capano was not NOT_anne NOT_marie's NOT_boss NOT_tom NOT_carper ,  the governor was .  that is the reason the feds became involved ,  he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case .  i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day .  i also read ann rule's book and saw the "city confidential" segment on a&e .  tom capano was a megalomanic(sp . ) ,  an uber-controller and a monster .  he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control .  when she wouldn't NOT_let NOT_him NOT_do NOT_that NOT_anymore NOT_he NOT_killed NOT_her ,  the ultimate form of control .  i think it's a waste of money that he is still alive . 
1594 0 i've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot .  i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera .  how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies?? porn movies have better scenarios and effects .  .  .  i wish i had those 2 hours back .  .  . <br /><br />the only good thing about this movie is the cast .  even though ,  their acting skills in this one could not NOT_lift NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_passable ,  the rest was just way too bad! <br /><br />it's the type of movie that i'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight . <br /><br />even worse ,  i saw a translated version of this flick .  .  . imagine ,  a bad movie .  .  . with an even worst translation .  .  . yikes! 
1595 1 to those who have not NOT_followed NOT_the NOT_anne NOT_marie NOT_fahey NOT_murder NOT_case .  you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all .  the murderer is popular delaware attorney ,  tom capano and the victim is the delaware governor's scheduling secretary ,  anne marie fahey .  their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder .  she wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't NOT_let NOT_her NOT_go NOT_so NOT_easily .  on the other hand ,  he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters .  where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life? besides ,  the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series .  while the actress who plays ms .  fahey does a fine job ,  she does not NOT_have NOT_her NOT_dark NOT_long NOT_hair .  his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman .  mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano .  it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations .  with ann rule's executive producing ,  she adds accuracy to anne marie's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder .  these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director .  if you have not NOT_read NOT_the NOT_book ,  it is well worth it .  ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime .  it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano .  he also played ann rule's former friend and subject ,  ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago .  he was brilliant then and now .  he does an above average job with an amazing story .  even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case .  and now ,  the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime ,  popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election .  if you don't NOT_think NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_interesting ,  then the read rule's book . 
1596 0 ok ,  the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale .  this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus .  first of all ,  strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus .  an organic virus is much more complex ,  even though it's way tinier .  though ,  it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe ,  organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna ,  then change your own rna code .  explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? i could see that ,  but obviously ,  the writer didn't NOT_think NOT_of NOT_that .

1598 0 in some ways ,  the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination .  however ,  no NOT_point NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_so NOT_obvious NOT_that NOT_it NOT_did NOT_not NOT_deserve NOT_lingering NOT_close-up NOT_shots .  i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people . <br /><br />the writer appears to have simply lifted clichã©s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters .  the actors did not NOT_help NOT_matters .  no NOT_chemistry .  i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories .  however ,  the writers didn't NOT_work NOT_very NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_develop NOT_the NOT_chemistry .  sure ,  they're both attractive ,  but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question . <br /><br />the confidence turner's character shows in sabato's developed far too quickly and for no NOT_particular NOT_reason .  sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_play NOT_by NOT_the NOT_rules .  think of the jeff goldblum character in "independence day . " usually ,  that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance .  sabato's character does not .  he's cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball .  he appears to be right by random chance . <br /><br />the death scenes are comical .  every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them .  the symptoms looked like bad claymation ,  sort of like that video from the 80s ,  peter gabriel ,  i think . 
1599 1 he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case ,  portraying attorney (and murderer) tom capano . <br /><br />kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim ,  anne marie fahey ,  but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim .  we are sorry for the situation ,  but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women (including rachel ward) as well . <br /><br />the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues ,  and capano actually had her psychologist killed .  pretty hard to believe ,  but this was based on a true story . <br /><br />there is a cameo with olympia dukakis (excellent) as capano's mother .  all in all ,  an interesting story because it is based on a true murder ,  and you will want to read ann rule's book to get the accurate details .  8/10 . 
1600 0 actually ,  this flick ,  made in 1999 ,  has pretty good production values .  the actors are attractive ,  and reasonably talented .  there aren't NOT_a NOT_bunch NOT_of NOT_clowns NOT_running NOT_around NOT_blasting NOT_away ,  expending hundreds of rounds ,  but never NOT_hitting NOT_flesh .  nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed . <br /><br />the interiors look respectably modern ,  architecturally ,  and the equipment looks up to snuff .  well ,  there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab .  and the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up .  not NOT_pancake NOT_make-up NOT_in NOT_the NOT_conventional NOT_sense ,  but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin .  this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer) . <br /><br />ah yes ,  the virus .  i would like to tell you that this is not NOT_the NOT_absolute NOT_worst NOT_premise NOT_for NOT_a NOT_sci-fi ,  horror flick i know of ,  but i can't .  a computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? gimme a break .  warp drives a la "star trek" are one thing ,  but photons becoming viruses? this is so silly the desired "fright factor" just isn't NOT_realizable .  the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive ,  or have a cat jump out of the closet ,  or something ,  because the viral thingamajig isn't NOT_doing NOT_it .  <br /><br />one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later ,  trashy venues .  he needed the money .  no NOT_other NOT_comparison NOT_between NOT_the NOT_two NOT_should NOT_be NOT_construed , however . 
1601 1 i couldn't have been more thrilled; just eight years old back in 1983 ,  i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater! the best day of my life was about to happen .  to that time ,  my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars .  i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet . <br /><br />and boy ,  did that day deliver for my less critical eyes .  jabba .  big rebel spaceships .  the emporer .  a green-bladed lightsaber!! wow! since that magical day ,  i must have watched this movie hundreds of times .  i can't NOT_even NOT_form NOT_an NOT_accurate NOT_estimate NOT_at NOT_this NOT_point .  with those multiple viewings ,  i have of course observed that this movie - the real episode iii - does have its flaws . <br /><br />of course in the context of a star wars movie ,  those "flaws" are more like "quirks" . <br /><br />millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 .  in may of 1983 ,  i had mine .  and this was my star wars movie . 
1602 0 despite its stereotypes ,  virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright; much better than i expected it to be .  i was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me .  but in the end ,  i thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichã©d) . <br /><br />the cast was quite good ,  and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously .  i couldn't help thinking ,  though ,  that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look-a-like .  maybe it's just her face or the make-up ,  hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time . <br /><br />while it's not NOT_a NOT_'must NOT_see' NOT_or NOT_a NOT_great NOT_film NOT_by NOT_any NOT_standard ,  'fatal error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end . 
1603 1 i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very "last" entry in the popular saga ,  and it's a very good one ,  as were several of these .  i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back ,  and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character(and also mark hamill ,  as an actor) .  after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks ,  they weren't NOT_so NOT_bad .  i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods ,  and i felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter .  the ending (with some new additions ,  i presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy .  i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films ,  but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not NOT_missing NOT_what NOT_i NOT_didn't NOT_already NOT_know ,  i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity .  oh ,  and ,  err -- carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit . 
1604 0 like so many media experiments ,  this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary .  in the 5+ years since it was released ,  the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development ,  and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason ,  i imagine .  .  .  the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock ,  and it's too bad that the film was not NOT_better NOT_executed ,  but in fact ,  it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction ,  including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention .  one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page . <br /><br />i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more .  sometimes the slick has less to offer us ,  and i would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes .  oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot ,  my heart rate went up ,  and i was reluctant to get up and take a break . 
1605 1 i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome .  i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished .  the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor/darth sidious .  he is about to be destroyed when darth vader ,  dark lord of the sith ,  eliminates his dark master .  a nice sacrifice .  the cinematography of this film is impressive .  i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers .  i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari ,  the ewoks ,  the sullesteian (lando's co pilot) and many more .  .  .  most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded .  2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker (sebastian shaw)(the greatest scene in star wars) 3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord . <br /><br />i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v . s luke skywalker on the death star .  post-script: the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable .  9/10 . 
1606 0 i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption . <br /><br />although it's been years since i read the story the first time ,  the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous .  very important elements ,  which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad . <br /><br />if the plot sounds interesting to you: go and get the novel .  its much ,  much ,  much better . <br /><br />still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich .

1608 0 i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable .  judge for yourself .  be warned ,  the following will not NOT_only NOT_give NOT_away NOT_the NOT_plot ,  but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie . <br /><br />a computer virus ,  designed by a frustrated nerd ,  sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors .  when the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body .  what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium .  within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck ,  develops tunnel vision ,  his skin will turn white of the calcium ,  after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk .  <br /><br />this virus is very intelligent .  when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage ,  which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head .  the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm .  fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water . <br /><br />oh dear .  .  . 
1609 1 no ,  there is another !<br /><br />because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ,  ii & iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy ,  i will state the good points of "the return of the jedi" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel .  of course ,  i loved the music ,  the special effects ,  the two droids ,  but this has been overly debated elsewhere . <br /><br />what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - a strong ecological concern - anti-militarist positions - fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force - cute creatures - harrison ford's smile - a killer scene : near the ending ,  when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor .  the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet .  and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke ,  thereby risking his own life ! oh ,  boy !<br /><br />what is wrong in the prequel inmho : - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults ,  than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen - the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /><br />by the way ,  if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web (obi wen ,  i mean) and yoda ,  then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japan . <br /><br />the magic of star wars ,  imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice ,  from a father to his son ,  albeit the difficulties .  "de mon ã¢me ã  ton ã¢me" ,  (from my soul to yours) ,  as would write bejard to the late zen master t .  deshimaru .

1611 1 "return of the jedi" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right ,  and that is a shame ,  because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling .  it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale ,  and does so very convincingly . <br /><br />yes ,  there are ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit .  but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga ,  where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader ,  the most recognizable villain in movie history . <br /><br />return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the "empire strikes back" to very convincing here) ,  an exciting opening at jabba's palace ,  a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor ,  luke finally coming into his own ,  the resolution of solo and leia's romance ,  and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon . <br /><br />yes ,  there are slight annoyances .  but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene .  it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter .  it's not NOT_a NOT_'good' NOT_movie NOT_- NOT_it's NOT_fantastic!

1614 0 i didn't NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_from NOT_this NOT_tv NOT_movie .  you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr .  still ,  it managed to disappoint ,  failing even to be a good-bad film . <br /><br />every scene was by rote ,  as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script ,  leaned back and said ,  "my work is done" .  it's all cliche ,  all predictable ,  and ,  even worse ,  the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously ,  (even when the plot developments are laughable) . <br /><br />do yourself a favor .  watch "the x-files" if you're in the mood for paranoia .  they handle it better .  also ,  let anyone know that sitting through "fatal error" is just that . 
1615 1 dear readers , <br /><br />the final battle between the rebellion and empire .  the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance .  luke skywalker ,  now a jedi knight ,  returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia ,  now revealed as luke's twin sister! they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star .  little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star . <br /><br />return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy .  it's got action ,  drama ,  romance ,  great battles ,  fantastic acting ,  amazing fight scenes ,  and awesome music by john williams .  mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight ,  gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm ,  relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy .  leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando .  3p0 ,  r2 ,  and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain: darth vader .  ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine .  the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty .  john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels . <br /><br />signed ,  the constant dvd collector 
1616 0 extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel . <br /><br />what was even worse was marlon brando's performance .  his southern drawl was ridiculous .  i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost .  brando ,  so great in previous films ,  was reduced here to a laughing stock .  tyrone power ,  in "witness for the prosecution , " should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here . <br /><br />the film ,  dealing with racism ,  dealt with the u . s .  government's attempt to avoid marriages between u . s .  soldiers and japanese women . <br /><br />brando was stone-faced throughout the movie .  his moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman .  his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views . <br /><br />only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances .  nothing about either performance was equally impressive .  umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part .  a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka ,  who did nicely as brando's love interest .  she showed great emotion as the anti-american who found love with the brando character .  her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11 .  she realized that her dancing was not NOT_her NOT_way NOT_out NOT_of NOT_this NOT_existence NOT_that NOT_she NOT_was NOT_living . <br /><br />martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in "the ten commandments" to the bigoted mother of brando's love interest at first .  her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted .  patricia owens ,  as brando's first love ,  showed depth and conviction in her performance . 
1617 1 i only wish that return of the jedi ,  have been directed by somebody else ,  i mean ,  there is far too much ewoks scenes ,  completely unnecessary .  besides this time our heroes look like different people: princess leia no NOT_longer NOT_fights NOT_with NOT_solo ,  luke looks boring ,  darth vader is not NOT_as NOT_evil NOT_as NOT_before ,  and yoda just dies . <br /><br />but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't NOT_hate NOT_it . <br /><br />some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence .  3-the emperor (now that's evil) 4- the speeders chase at the endor forest .  5-the last battle .  6-the dark side seduction scene .  7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force .  8- and the last celebration . <br /><br />some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes .  if some scenes would have been cut ,  and another director was hired ,  this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 ,  but still is extraordinary .  9 out of 10 .

1619 1 a very good movie .  a classic sci-fi film with humor ,  action and everything .  this movie offers a greater number of aliens .  we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces .  the emperor is somewhat an original character .  i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese .  (excellent references) i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga .  in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls .  i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi-wan .  it gives a sadness and a tear .  the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie: when vader turns on the emperor .  luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi-wan ,  yoda and .  .  . his father (1997 version not NOT_hayden NOT_christenssen) .  the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia .  there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending .  i felt there was much more than meets the eye .  and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe . 
1620 0 if you are one of the people who finds "according to jim" great television comedy ,  this is going to rock your world .  and might i add ,  kudos for proving that good talent ,  good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc ,  which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year . <br /><br />"k-911" is a big ,  steaming ,  brown ,  german shepherd-sized "thank you" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie .  it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve .  jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never NOT_far NOT_behind NOT_his NOT_ability NOT_to NOT_butcher NOT_a NOT_blues NOT_standard .  look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee . <br /><br />if you enjoy jim's work ,  this movie is your reward . 
1621 1 this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies .  <br /><br />the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place ,  where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious .  he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of bantha ,  who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark .  luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off .  adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo ,  who was frozen alive at the end of episode v ,  jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside . <br /><br />but all of the star wars "good guys" ,  especially r2-d2 ,  had other ideas .  .  . and those other ideas fended off luke's execution; in the end ,  most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death . <br /><br />like in episode iv ,  the death star in episode vi makes its appearance .  as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star ,  the star destroyer personnel ,  i guessed ,  sped up the arming of the main laser ,  using the imperial fighters as a diversion .  the 20-25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise .  once it fired ,  the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out ,  and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out .  and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience . <br /><br />like in episode v ,  the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons ,  killing at least one of the ewoks .  .  . but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them .  for instance ,  chewbacca ,  as well as another ewok ,  was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers) ,  and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers . <br /><br />it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre ,  like ,  for instance ,  the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike ,  and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike .  or ,  in a climax ,  using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader . <br /><br />you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown ,  complete with a short display of fireworks ,  drumming on the spoils of victory (e . g .  ,  storm trooper masks) ,  and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis---darth vader ,  now dead ,  is burned on a pyre .  the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not NOT_buy NOT_that--even NOT_with NOT_the NOT_strong NOT_respect NOT_of NOT_film NOT_composer NOT_john NOT_williams . <br /><br />on the home movie version ,  i think lucas himself wanted a different ending .  in addition to the celebration on endor ,  he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets ,  including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith .  the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece .  he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction ,  balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies . 
1622 0 the original was a good movie .  i bought it on tape and have watched it several times .  and though i know that sequels are not NOT_usually NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_the NOT_original NOT_i NOT_certainly NOT_wasn't NOT_expecting NOT_such NOT_a NOT_bomb .  the romance was flat ,  the sight gags old ,  the spoken humor just wasn't .  this may not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_movie NOT_i've NOT_ever NOT_seen NOT_but NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_close . 
1623 1 when i think of return of the jedi i think epic .  yeah ewoks were in there so what? they're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts) .  jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies .  emperor palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie .  palpatine is so evil and vicious ,  vader looks like mr .  rogers compared to him  .  speaking of darth vader ,  what an amazing end to such an iconic character .  vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out .  his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you .  the best part was of course the special effects .  it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics .  the scenes at jabba's palace (leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at .  in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history . 
1624 0 i am very disappointed with "k-911 . " the original "good" quality of "k-9" doesn't NOT_exist NOT_any NOT_more .  this is more like a sitcom! some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back .  the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show .  that was crazy .  what's the deal with the change of police? it seems like they are now lapd! not NOT_san NOT_diego NOT_pd .  it is a completely different movie from " 
1625 1 i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with .  in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia ,  the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains ,  the sinister darth vadar .  in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen .  he made a film with no NOT_specific NOT_end NOT_or NOT_beginning NOT_and NOT_it NOT_went NOT_down NOT_a NOT_treat .  return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time . <br /><br />when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse .  vadar it seemed had won the day .  how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul . <br /><br />old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself ( played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud . how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery . ) desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar . all in black with his red eyes , ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold .  his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good .  <br /><br />lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted .  we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks ( who i really do not NOT_believe NOT_take NOT_from NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_at NOT_all .  in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star) and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers .  we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all .  and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back . <br /><br />but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar .  for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings .  vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke .  never NOT_did NOT_i NOT_think NOT_that NOT_a NOT_mask NOT_could NOT_show NOT_emotion NOT_but NOT_some-how NOT_one NOT_can't NOT_but NOT_see NOT_the NOT_confusion NOT_and NOT_pain NOT_on NOT_vadar's NOT_face NOT_during NOT_the NOT_final NOT_scenes NOT_as NOT_the NOT_emporer NOT_turns NOT_on NOT_luke .  there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain ,  especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible .  he is conflicted .  the apprentice as much as the master .  the victim as much as the villain .  without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy . <br /><br />so in conclusion what can i say .  george lucas is the master of the saga .  star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it .  return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves .  it's action ,  suspense ,  romance ,  tragedy ,  redemption ,  joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters ,  wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of . 
1626 0 the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands .  but she is speaking german to him .  the 2 languishes are completely different ,  its like saying "well he takes french commands" and start talking spanish . <br /><br />james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not NOT_a NOT_detective NOT_in NOT_the NOT_slightest .  the role just doesn't NOT_fit NOT_him ,  even if its mend to be a comedy . <br /><br />to many stereotype/predicable stuff .  typical comment or comebacks . <br /><br />if you don't NOT_look NOT_at NOT_those NOT_things NOT_i NOT_think NOT_it NOT_could NOT_be NOT_a NOT_nice NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_if NOT_its NOT_ever NOT_on NOT_tv .  but i wouldn't NOT_suggesting NOT_renting NOT_it . 
1627 1 after ''empire strikes back'' ''return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series . <br /><br />luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba .  at the same time ,  the galactic empire is doing in secret ,  the construction of a new space station like the previous death star .  if this station stays totally constructed ,  it will be the end of the rebel alliance .  both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star , and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule . <br /><br />r2 and c3po are inside jabba's palace to send a message from luke to jabba , where lukes pretends to negotiate han's life .  he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan .  jabba does not NOT_accept NOT_the NOT_negotiation , since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace's decoration . (han still is frozen in carbonite) lando is hidden as jabba's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter .  when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again ,  we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise .  the problem is that jabba discovers leia's plan and takes her as his slave , while han is thrown away in chewbacca's cell . <br /><br />luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends .  at his first try to kill jabba , he falls into jabba's monster cell (bantha) , but easily kills it .  jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han , chewbacca and luke to sarlacc ,  a big creature from the desert who stays 1 . 000 years digesting it's 'food' .  luke , han and chewie has success in scape again ,  and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc's mouth .  leia kills jabba and goes after han , luke and chewie as well c3po and r2 .  <br /><br />everybody's safe again , luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi , as well his promise to yoda .  the problem is that yoda is too old and sick ,  since he already has 900 years old ,  and before he dies ,  yoda says to luke that he does not NOT_need NOT_more NOT_training , but to really be a jedi ,  he must fight with vader again .  he confirms to luke that vader is luke's dad ,  and that there is another skywalker besides luke .  in his last moments ,  yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side ,  and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people .  when yoda dies , obi wan's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader ,  and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith .  luke stays worried about killing his own dad ,  and says that he feels that his father still has kindness .  obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia ,  and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies .  he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader ,  the emperor will win the war . <br /><br />at the same time ,  the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up ,  since luke is stronger than before ,  and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side . <br /><br />now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series , when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station ,  the '' death star 2'' ,  luke will confront vader and the emperor ,  and leia ,  han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field ,  with the help of the ewoks .  (little creatures who looks little bears)<br /><br />this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!

1630 0 i just got the uk 4-disc special edition of superman 1 for about $5 .  the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole-men .  so i slapped it into the dvd player last night ,  and here are my findings . <br /><br />some initial disappointment - i hadn't checked ,  and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials .  i'm not NOT_a NOT_huge NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_george NOT_reeves NOT_as NOT_superman ,  and i hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn - but hey ho ,  never NOT_mind . <br /><br />this black and white production runs for less than an hour .  it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves' early tv series ,  a two-parter ,  put together for cinema release ,  although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series .  in any event ,  it's an odd choice for reasons i'll get to later .  i'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets ,  so there were no NOT_major NOT_surprises NOT_here .  even so ,  for a low budget movie ,  this one is really low budget . <br /><br />the story concerns the small town of silsby - population 1 , 430 - which ,  puzzlingly ,  is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles) .  the story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down .  this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well ,  at the behest of the oil company .  as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down ,  a couple of odd little guys (small in stature ,  big in head ,  black in jumpsuit ,  and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft ,  and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces . <br /><br />a deep breath now ,  here is the remaining plot of the picture .  the little guys scare some kids ,  so jeff corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these "creatures" .  superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital .  corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed ,  but he escapes and legs it down the shaft .  corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised mole-man .  superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows .  a total of 4 mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey (i call this an aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go "aargh!") and superman saves him .  he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved ,  the mole-men go back down the shaft .  the end . <br /><br />despite the film only being an hour long ,  there is an inordinate amount of creeping around ,  bewareing and pursuing - i have left out all the "mole-man 1 creeps from a to b ,  looking out to make sure no-one is following him" stuff .  the mole-men are never NOT_engaged NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way NOT_whatsoever NOT_- NOT_they NOT_have NOT_no NOT_dialogue NOT_- NOT_they NOT_just NOT_turn NOT_up ,  get persecuted ,  and go back .  they do look a little creepy ,  but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies . <br /><br />reeves is quite a good clark kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter ,  much more so than phyllis coates' rather indifferent lois lane .  but he is a terrible ,  terrible superman .  not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_he NOT_not NOT_look NOT_the NOT_part NOT_(at NOT_least NOT_his NOT_hair NOT_is NOT_dyed NOT_black NOT_in NOT_this ,  which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes) ,  the way he plays it is all wrong in my book .  i'm sure he was told to "strike the pose" (which superman does constantly) ,  but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips ,  not NOT_fists NOT_on NOT_ribs .  and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't NOT_actually NOT_wag NOT_his NOT_finger NOT_in NOT_remonstration ,  but he may as well have done . <br /><br />and superman does a huge amount of walking around (i say a huge amount - he isn't NOT_actually NOT_in NOT_it NOT_all NOT_that NOT_much) ,  and a bit of running .  he takes off and lands a couple of times ,  but isn't NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_flight NOT_at NOT_any NOT_point .  oh ,  some bullets bounce off him ,  and he uses telescopic vision as clark ,  but with no NOT_accompanying NOT_visual NOT_effect .  in fact ,  visual effects are conspicuous by their absence ,  and the few which are present aren't NOT_very NOT_good . <br /><br />i've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards i think it's a pretty threadbare effort .  thankfully ,  production standards on the tv series were higher ,  and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them . <br /><br />something of a disappointment - i shan't be watching it again . 
1631 1 this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy ,  for a variety of reasons .  however it emerges at the end of the day a winner ,  despite all its flaws .  it's still a very good film ,  even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments . <br /><br />one problem here is the look of the film ,  which isn't NOT_very NOT_consistent NOT_with NOT_the NOT_other NOT_2 NOT_films .  i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz .  the first 2 films have that dirty ,  lived-in look with all the technology and so forth .  in "jedi" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned .  this makes for a much less textured film .  also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy .  at this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself . <br /><br />another aspect is its lack of originality .  where "star wars" created a whole new experience in cinema and "empire" brought us to alien worlds of swamps ,  ice ,  and clouds ,  "jedi" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film .  first we are back on the desert planet tatooine ,  and then we are watching them face another death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new .  .  .  but you'd think lucas or kasdan could) .  also we have these ewoks ,  who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears ,  in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of "star wars" if they hadn't run out of cash .  it just feels like lazy construction . <br /><br />the most unfortunate aspect of "jedi" for me is the weak handling of the han solo character .  whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time ,  trading one liners with the droids .  instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke -- as if the conclusion of "empire" where she confessed her love of him had never NOT_happened .  the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not NOT_part NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film's NOT_central NOT_story NOT_after NOT_his NOT_rescue .  ford ,  for his part ,  looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances .  this is more like a 1990s ford performance ,  bored and looking "above" the film itself .  fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes .  lando ,  an interesting character introduced in "empire" ,  here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle .  only hamill ,  given an interesting development in the luke character ,  is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character .  probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work .  and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters .  really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package .  ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor .  the film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films) . <br /><br />visually and in terms of effects work ,  other than the "clean" look of everything it's hard to find fault .  jabba is a very effective animatronic character ,  one of the most elaborate ever constructed .  the space battles towards the end are very impressive . <br /><br />ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears .  but on its own ,  it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions . 
1632 0 back in the 1970s ,  wpix ran "the adventures of superman" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years .  every once in a while ,  we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air "superman and the mole men . " i always looked forward to those days .  watching it recently ,  i was surprised at just how bad it really was . <br /><br />it wasn't NOT_bad NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_special NOT_effects ,  or lack thereof .  true ,  george reeves' superman costume was pretty bad ,  the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible .  and true ,  the mole men's costumes were even worse .  what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't NOT_have NOT_fooled NOT_a NOT_ten NOT_year-old ,  since the zippers ,  sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious .  but these were forgivable shortcomings . <br /><br />no ,  what made it bad were the contrived plot devices .  time and again ,  superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating .  a lynch mob is searching for the creatures? rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself ,  he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man .  the creatures are cornered? again ,  he stands around watching and talking but doesn't NOT_save NOT_them NOT_until NOT_they're NOT_shot .  luke benson ,  the town's rabble-rouser ,  shoots at him? attempted murder to any reasonable person ,  but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems .  superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud ,  but never NOT_once NOT_took NOT_advantage NOT_of NOT_them . <br /><br />that said ,  both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well ,  seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles .  if only they had been given a better script to work with . 
1633 1 first ,  i'd like to say that ,  while i know my share about star wars ,  i am not NOT_a NOT_fanatic .  i do not NOT_know NOT_how NOT_many NOT_chromosomes NOT_a NOT_wamp NOT_rat NOT_has NOT_or NOT_the NOT_extended NOT_family NOT_of NOT_tk427 .  what i know is this: star wars ,  all the movies(less so with episode 2 though) ,  captured something magical .  it's hard to say what ,  what button lucas has found and boldly pressed ,  but it works .  star wars is more than a movie .  it's an idea . <br /><br />how ,  may you ask? i shall explain .  star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes ,  good vs evil .  it does this so obviously ,  so profoundly ,  that literally any person from any environment can understand .  episode vi does the very well ,  concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father ,  yet also ,  with the addition of the prequels ,  reveals even more to the hinted back story .  suddenly ,  it's darth vader at the front ,  and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin ,  not NOT_just NOT_luke .  but even before 1-3 ,  there was amazing depth to it all .  it felt real ,  as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap ,  detailing a historical account of a galaxy far ,  far away . <br /><br />star wars is definitely something far above the norm ,  and i must admit ,  whenever i see them ,  particularly this one ,  i feel very small .  i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined .  i get a tingling feeling when i see them ,  a feeling that something ,  somehow ,  has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope . 
1634 0 "you're not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_shoot NOT_those NOT_little NOT_creatures .  in the first place ,  they haven't done you any harm .  in the second place ,  they may be radioactive . " ah ,  the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fiâ… yet despite the odd gem like that ,  superman and the mole-men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time .  it's beyond cheap (the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it ,  though it has a surprisingly altruistic message â– the mute mole-men ,  diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters ,  released from their underground world by oil drilling are not NOT_malicious ,  merely misunderstood ,  and george reeves' man of steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by jeff corey from killing them .  an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day ,  perhaps ,  but with little more than good intentions to recommend it . 
1635 1 i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies .  i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted .  to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot ,  the most suspense ,  surprises ,  most emotional , (especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie .  i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving ,  was not NOT_as NOT_episodic ,  and i just did not NOT_feel NOT_as NOT_much NOT_suspense NOT_or NOT_emotion NOT_as NOT_i NOT_did NOT_with NOT_the NOT_third NOT_movie . <br /><br />it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole .  i have heard many strange reasons such as: a) because yoda died b) because bobba fett died c) because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) because darth vader was revealed<br /><br />i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely .  first off ,  who cares if bobba fett died??? if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die .  don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong NOT_i NOT_am NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_bobba NOT_fett NOT_but NOT_he NOT_made NOT_a NOT_few NOT_cameo NOT_appearances NOT_and NOT_it NOT_was NOT_not NOT_lucas' NOT_intention NOT_to NOT_make NOT_him NOT_a NOT_central NOT_character NOT_in NOT_the NOT_films NOT_that NOT_star NOT_wars NOT_fans NOT_made NOT_him NOT_out NOT_to NOT_be .  his name was not NOT_even NOT_mentioned NOT_anywhere NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie .  .  .  you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett's name!!! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think .  .  .  secondly ,  many fans did not NOT_like NOT_yoda NOT_dying .  sure ,  it was a momentous period in the movie .  i was not NOT_happy NOT_to NOT_see NOT_him NOT_die NOT_either NOT_but NOT_it NOT_makes NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_more NOT_realistic .  all the good guys can't NOT_stay NOT_alive NOT_in NOT_a NOT_realistic NOT_movie ,  you know .  otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon .  another aspect to this point about people not NOT_liking NOT_yoda's NOT_death .  .  well ,  nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope .  (many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy) why was obi wan's death okay but yoda's not .  .  .  hmmmmmmmmmmmm .  .  .  .  another reason i just can not NOT_believe NOT_was NOT_even NOT_stated NOT_was NOT_because NOT_people NOT_found NOT_cute NOT_ewoks NOT_overpowering NOT_stormtroopers NOT_to NOT_be NOT_impossible .  that is utterly ridiculous!! i can not NOT_believe NOT_this NOT_one!! NOT_first NOT_off ,  the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there .  if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage .  (since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) they had swinging vines ,  ropes ,  logs set up to trip those walkers ,  and other traps .  the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not NOT_aware NOT_of NOT_the NOT_advantages NOT_of NOT_the NOT_forest .  the only thing they had was their blasters .  to add ,  it was not NOT_like NOT_the NOT_ewoks NOT_were NOT_battling NOT_the NOT_stormtroopers NOT_themselves ,  they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest .  i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros ,  the band of rebels ,  as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain ,  that would have been a great upset .  lastly ,  if this scene was still unbelievable to you .  .  how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo ,  chewbacca ,  and the princess ,  being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! and not NOT_only NOT_that ,  the heroes  ,  of course ,  always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters .  the troopers must have very ,  very bad aim then! at least in empire strikes back ,  the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not NOT_3 NOT_heroes NOT_against NOT_a NOT_legion NOT_of NOT_stormtroopers .  don't NOT_believe NOT_me? NOT_check NOT_out NOT_the NOT_battle NOT_at NOT_cloud NOT_city NOT_when NOT_our NOT_heroes NOT_were NOT_escaping NOT_lando's NOT_base .  or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star . <br /><br />the last reason that i care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here . ) is that people did not NOT_like NOT_darth NOT_vader NOT_being NOT_revealed! NOT_well ,  in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie .  luke was trying to find whether or not NOT_darth NOT_vader NOT_was NOT_his NOT_father ,  annakin skywalker .  it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete .  by annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was annakin skywalker (by removing the helmet) .  the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about .  in fact ,  that's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke's father .  .  . isn't NOT_that NOT_what NOT_you NOT_would NOT_have NOT_done NOT_if NOT_you NOT_wanted NOT_to NOT_see NOT_your NOT_son NOT_with NOT_your NOT_own NOT_eyes NOT_before NOT_you NOT_died NOT_and NOT_not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_mechanized NOT_helmet?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>on NOT_another NOT_note ,  i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not NOT_get NOT_as NOT_many NOT_accolades NOT_as NOT_it NOT_deserves .  i never NOT_go NOT_into NOT_a NOT_film NOT_with NOT_that NOT_deception NOT_in NOT_mind ,  i always try to go into a film with the attitude that "well ,  it might be better or worse that the original  .  .  but i can not NOT_know NOT_for NOT_sure .  .  let's see . " that way i go with an open mind and do not NOT_dupe NOT_myself NOT_into NOT_thinking NOT_that NOT_a NOT_clearly NOT_superior NOT_film NOT_is NOT_not NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_it NOT_really NOT_was . <br /><br />i am not NOT_sure NOT_who NOT_criticizes NOT_these NOT_movies NOT_but ,  i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite) that it is rotj .  i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading . <br /><br />bottom line ,  the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy .  this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes .  there was not NOT_a NOT_moment NOT_of NOT_boredom NOT_because NOT_each NOT_scene NOT_was NOT_either NOT_suspenseful ,  exciting ,  surprising ,  or all of the above .  for example ,  the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day!!!<br /><br />finally ,  i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky ,  insignificant details (or see it as "just another sequel") to trash the movie such as "this movie stinks because luke is not NOT_in NOT_it!" NOT_then NOT_this NOT_meritorious NOT_film NOT_will NOT_become NOT_another NOT_spectacular NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_will NOT_be NOT_the NOT_subject NOT_of NOT_derision NOT_like NOT_rotj NOT_suffered NOT_unfortunately . <br /><br /> 
1636 0 this film is notable for three reasons . <br /><br />first ,  apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'superman' serials ,  this low budget feature was made and released to theaters ,  marking george reeves' and phyllis coates' initial appearances as clark kent / superman and lois lane .  part of the opening is re-used in the series .  outside the town of silby ,  a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow earth' allowing the 'mole-men' to come to the surface .  forget about the other holes (those in the plot) . <br /><br />second ,  unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties ,  the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes .  no NOT_'mild NOT_mannered NOT_reporter' NOT_here! NOT_clark NOT_kent ,  knowledgeable and self-assertive ,  grabs control of the situation throughout ("i'll handle this!") ,  even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole-man! as superman ,  he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois ,  but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as "nazi storm troopers . " <br /><br />third ,  you will notice that the transition from the fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'adventures of superman' had not NOT_yet NOT_been NOT_made . 
1637 1 return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series ,  and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga .  with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star ,  the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side ,  and only our favourite heroes can pull it off . <br /><br />the opening sequence ,  set on tatooine ,  we see jabba's palace ,  a pit of slavery and scum ,  and new home to han solo ,  as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue ,  and with luke's jedi powers ,  they have the edge . <br /><br />we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end .  han ,  leia and chewy battle it out on endor ,  desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star .  the rebel fleet led by lando ,  battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down ,  and luke has a final showdown with darth vader .  an epic end to a classic saga ,  and it's only just of the pace of the first two . <br /><br />10/10 
1638 0 "the domino principle" is ,  without question ,  one of the worst thrillers ever made .  hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream "i give up!!!"<br /><br />how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks . <br /><br />i hope they spent their money well . 
1639 1 despite the feelings of most "star wars" fans ,  in my opinion "return of the jedi" is the greatest cinematic film ever created .  ever since the first time i saw it ,  it's depth ,  intensity ,  special effects ,  and moving story have overwhelmed me .  the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years .  filled with powerful action ,  as the climax of the original trilogy ,  george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the "star wars" saga in "jedi" . <br /><br />film summary (contains spoilers for those who have not NOT_seen NOT_it)<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>after NOT_"the NOT_empire NOT_strikes NOT_back" NOT_left NOT_us NOT_hanging NOT_for NOT_3 NOT_long NOT_years NOT_we NOT_finally NOT_find NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story NOT_in NOT_"return NOT_of NOT_the NOT_jedi" .  darth vader ,  in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it's construction .  the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side .  luke ,  lando ,  leia ,  chewie ,  and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord; jabba the hutt .  after han has been rescued ,  and jabba defeated ,  luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth; darth vader is in fact his father .  the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet .  now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed .  while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon ,  the rebel heroes must disable the death star's shield generator on the forest moon of endor .  it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry ,  but mighty ewoks .  during the the two part intense battle ,  a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side .  in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions .  as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine ,  vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life .  <br /><br />filled with a deep timeless story of good vs .  evil ,  "return of the jedi" is a spectacular ,  emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us . 
1640 0 what did producer/director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy's novel and kennedy's very puzzling screenplay? were there a few pieces left out on purpose? and what about gene hackman ,  richard widmark ,  edward albert ,  eli wallach and mickey rooney? what did they see in this very muddled story?<br /><br />and why did candice bergen ,  who gave a horrible performance ,  accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin .  a major misfire by stanley kramer . 
1641 1 this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot .  however ,  this is not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_totally NOT_worthless NOT_entry NOT_in NOT_the NOT_series .  on the contrary .  sure ,  it's not NOT_as NOT_groundbreaking NOT_as NOT_its NOT_predecessors NOT_and NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_more NOT_slow-going NOT_at NOT_times ,  but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission . <br /><br />the first third of the movie ,  where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt ,  is a classic .  jabba ,  a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language ,  not NOT_only NOT_makes NOT_a NOT_great NOT_villain ,  but a memorable one ,  too .  it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet ,  much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product .  actually ,  what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court ,  including the intimidating ,  slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster .  it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while . <br /><br />things get a little bit slower around the second act ,  where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor ,  home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks .  most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures ,  in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga .  i don't NOT_totally NOT_agree NOT_with NOT_that ,  although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should .  however ,  their leader ,  wicket (played by warrick davis) is a delightfully memorable creation ,  and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple ,  natural weapons provides a nice contrast . <br /><br />by the time we get to the third act ,  though ,  the pace picks up again ,  as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops ,  lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all-new half-completed death star ,  and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor .  the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie .  mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes ,  and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance .  also ,  as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is ,  he is rivaled only by the shriveled ,  crone-like emperor ,  played with deliciously raspy ,  frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid .  the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment ,  which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored . <br /><br />the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects ,  and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors .  the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always ,  and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout .  of course ,  given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back ,  it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence .  the acting is classic star wars fare; hamill ,  harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles ,  and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po .  frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes ,  but he makes the most of it .  and yes ,  there's also john williams' music . <br /><br />all told ,  while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle ,  the first and third acts deliver in style ,  making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever . <br /><br />in 1997 ,  george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored (and revamped) "special editions" ,  which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements .  of the three ,  return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans .  perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not NOT_so NOT_easily NOT_offended) NOT_"jedi NOT_rocks" NOT_musical NOT_number NOT_in NOT_jabba's NOT_palace ,  which ,  although technically amazing ,  does disrupt the flow of the film .  however ,  i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy .  this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on naboo ,  where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming ,  "wesa free!") ,  and ,  in what is probably the most controversial change ,  hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes .  probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii: attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone .  however ,  if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically (and contemplating about it) ,  chances are you may react a little differently .  nonetheless ,  it is an issue that fans have raised ,  so it's probably best to be warned beforehand . <br /><br />as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films ,  he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the "definitive" editions of his classic trilogy ,  and ,  when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga (as lucas intended) ,  it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent .  the original films will always be engraved in our memories ,  but these new incarnations are just as much fun ,  if one can give them a chance . 
1642 0 stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills .  the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task .  richard widmark ,  edward albert ,  and eli wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government ,  but that ,  like most of the movie's plot line ,  is never NOT_made NOT_clear .  hackman asks a lot of questions that never NOT_get NOT_answered NOT_so NOT_the NOT_film NOT_goes NOT_absolutely NOT_nowhere .  while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view ,  the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom .  the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it .  kramer's direction is devoid of any style .  it's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad .  widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey .  even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick .  one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife .  we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang .  kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig .  it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell . 
1643 1 after "star wars: a new hope" redefined science fiction ,  and "the empire strikes back" redefined "star wars" ,  it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two ,  but this one really does a nice job .  the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one ,  with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films .  then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war .  there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the emperor .  when the battle begins ,  the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it ,  and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films .  this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy ,  with the most at stake for the rebellion .  this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including han solo ,  chewbacca ,  and leia) ,  the battle raging on in space (including lando) ,  and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star ,  which leads up to another duel with darth vader .  it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war ,  and there seems to be no NOT_escape .  although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched ,  it didn't NOT_seem NOT_very NOT_unrealistic NOT_since NOT_they NOT_were NOT_more NOT_of NOT_a NOT_distraction NOT_that NOT_the NOT_rebels NOT_could NOT_use ,  rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers ,  although they did have some luck fighting them .  there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming ,  which may not NOT_be NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_stunning NOT_as NOT_that NOT_of NOT_"the NOT_empire NOT_strikes NOT_back" ,  but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well .  with the light tone of "a new hope" and the more sinnister tone of "the empire strikes back" ,  this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale .  the special edition for "return of the jedi" concentrated on what would have been nice to change ,  since not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_the NOT_original NOT_really NOT_needed NOT_it .  fifteen years of technology advancements didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_fifteen NOT_years NOT_of NOT_deterioration NOT_as NOT_far NOT_as NOT_the NOT_rancor NOT_scene NOT_is NOT_concerned ,  and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter ,  but other than that it was good .  the gaping non-threatening sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged ,  which definitely added to the suspense .  also ,  the disco was taken out of jabba's palace ,  and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy ,  instead of just a small ewok village ,  which was the case of the original and that didn't NOT_really NOT_end NOT_a NOT_story NOT_this NOT_big NOT_the NOT_way NOT_it NOT_deserved .  it's hard to say which of the three films was the best ,  but since it's all part of the same story ,  the over-all trilogy is like one big ,  outstanding film .  a third must-see for film fans . 
1644 0 there are really two sections of this film .  firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'the simpsons' troy mcclure should be doing the narration . <br /><br />then the rest of the film begins (starting off with a title song which really doesn't NOT_fit NOT_in NOT_with NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film) NOT_which ,  while technically ok ,  is killed by a vague ,  inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not NOT_just NOT_uninteresting NOT_characters ,  but characters that make no NOT_sense . <br /><br />this is especially so with mickey rooney's spiventa ,  who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? in that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character ,  which in the end he still is . <br /><br />the overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy .  it's as if the filmmakers didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_courage NOT_to NOT_imply NOT_that NOT_a NOT_particular NOT_section NOT_of NOT_society NOT_would NOT_be NOT_capable NOT_of NOT_creating NOT_such NOT_an NOT_organisation NOT_and NOT_instead NOT_settled NOT_on NOT_the NOT_hope NOT_that NOT_a NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_explanation NOT_would NOT_suffice NOT_and NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_would NOT_form NOT_their NOT_own NOT_conclusions . <br /><br />put simply ,  the film fails on all levels . 
1645 1 the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish ,  spectacular-looking production .  it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy ,  but i think it is a notch above episode iv (and just a notch below episodes iii and v) .  in fact ,  i think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga .  as far as i'm concerned ,  it is still a grandiosely entertaining film .  it is not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_a NOT_beginning ,  climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to lucas' universe .  there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing ,  which makes the film a little too sentimental ,  but emotionally rewarding .  also ,  it is a lot of fun .  new characters are introduced and old ones face new ,  unexpected challenges .  c3po and r2d2 provide (as usual) great comic relief .  leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo ,  and luke is still a great character to identify with .  again ,  it is luke's (and vader's) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone .  lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent ,  and the film's themes of loyalty ,  hope ,  and redemption resonate strongly .  i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii ,  viii and ix ,  because this film is a great bookend to a long ,  fascinating and captivating saga .  not NOT_a NOT_perfect NOT_movie ,  but fun in the best matinã©e style . 
1646 0 first ,  it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job .  what a waste of time ,  we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters ,  why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences .  then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere ,  simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters .  again ,  another 20 minutes .  then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife .  all of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action ,  intrigue and plot twists .  by the time the real action gets going ,  i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end .  hackman is great as usual ,  and the other actors as well ,  but this is a dud of the first magnitude . 
1647 1 up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga ,  which finally ended in 2005 ,  i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series .  the varied action scenes and really different characters (jabba the hut ,  furry woodland creatures ,  etc . ) made this a particularly appealing movie . <br /><br />none of the action ever focused too long in one spot ,  either .  the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vader . <br /><br />another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not NOT_was NOT_the NOT_absence NOT_of NOT_in-fighting NOT_between NOT_two NOT_of NOT_the NOT_stars .  gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford .  finally ,  everyone was on the same page! it was nice to see . <br /><br />in the end ,  this was simply a wonderful adventure tale ,  more than anything else . 
1648 0 gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination .  it's a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job . <br /><br />nobody tells him anything though ,  he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information .  that's supposed to be suspenseful ,  instead it's annoying and boring .  <br /><br />hackman goes through with the mission ,  but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up .  so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't NOT_really NOT_care . <br /><br />one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long ,  almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit .  maybe something really was lost in the translation ,  but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience . <br /><br />a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark ,  candice bergen ,  mickey rooney ,  eli wallach ,  and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime .  <br /><br />and we never NOT_do NOT_find NOT_out NOT_just NOT_what NOT_federal NOT_agency NOT_was NOT_doing NOT_all NOT_this ,  the fbi ,  the cia ,  the dea or even the irs . 
1649 1 when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very ,  very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga) .  having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective .  the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor .  it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmã© and the love she felt for her children .  actually while the new films (especially episode ii) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only .  they make the old films seem even better . <br /><br />mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie .  he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real .  in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job .  harrison ford is still good .  however ,  you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit .  he adds more comedy (obviously inspired from raiders) to the character which works brilliantly .  in short han solo is better than ever .  carrie fisher was never NOT_really NOT_a NOT_good NOT_actress NOT_but NOT_she NOT_does NOT_a NOT_decent NOT_job NOT_and NOT_is NOT_certainly NOT_passable .  ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever .  james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very ,  very good . <br /><br />in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always lucas' fortã© so that is really to be expected .  the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise .  it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax .  <br /><br />the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks .  these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in .  besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery . <br /><br />all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant .  also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance . <br /><br />8/10

1651 1 a long time ago ,  in a galaxy far ,  far away .  .  .  .  . there was a boy who was only two years old when the original "star wars" film was released .  he doesn't NOT_remember NOT_first NOT_seeing NOT_the NOT_movie ,  but he also doesn't NOT_remember NOT_life NOT_before NOT_it .  he does remember the first "star wars" themed gift he got .  .  . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set .  he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be .  but years later ,  he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures ,  ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection .  it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed ,  anakin skywalker ,  stopped being produced and carried in stores ,  and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask .  .  . it's a northern illinois university thing) . <br /><br />i can't NOT_review NOT_"star NOT_wars" NOT_as NOT_a NOT_movie .  it represents absolutely everything good ,  fun and magical about my childhood .  there's no NOT_separating NOT_it NOT_in NOT_my NOT_mind NOT_from NOT_christmases ,  birthdays ,  summers and winters growing up .  in the winter ,  my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth (i was always han solo) .  my friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house ,  and that served as the ewok village .  they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it ,  and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home .  i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to "star wars" and i think people either just understand that or they don't .  i don't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_appeal NOT_of NOT_"lord NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rings" NOT_or NOT_"star NOT_trek" NOT_but NOT_i NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_rabid NOT_flocks NOT_of NOT_fans NOT_that NOT_follow NOT_them NOT_because NOT_i NOT_am NOT_a NOT_rabid NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_george NOT_lucas's NOT_films . <br /><br />i feel no NOT_need NOT_to NOT_defend NOT_my NOT_opinion NOT_of NOT_these NOT_movies NOT_as NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_of NOT_all NOT_time .  every time i put them in the dvd player ,  i feel like i'm eight years old again ,  when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker . <br /><br />grade (for the entire trilogy): a+ 
1652 0 i love these actors ,  but they were wasted in this flick . <br /><br />i can only wonder ,  what were they thinking agreeing to this crap???<br /><br />debra winger just phoned it in; dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures .  some people thought it was deep .  well ,  if you liked "breaking the waves" ,  you'll probably like this too .  i hated both .  3/10 
1653 1 i'm sick of people whining about ewoks! true ,  they're not NOT_the NOT_best NOT_thing NOT_that NOT_ever NOT_happened NOT_to NOT_star NOT_wars ,  but they did happen ,  so deal with it! besides ,  they are cute ,  and i don't NOT_care NOT_if NOT_they're NOT_marketable .  yubb nubb!<br /><br />this movie always leaves me in tears .  it's perfect .  the end could not NOT_be NOT_better .  i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin .  i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way .  so those of you who are complaining that vader's helmet was removed ,  take a moment to think about it .  it's very effective .  vader ,  the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years ,  is finally revealed as a sick-looking man .  he is not NOT_entirely NOT_machine NOT_- NOT_he's NOT_vulnerable . <br /><br />i don't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_the NOT_casting NOT_director NOT_happened NOT_to NOT_pick NOT_such NOT_good NOT_actors NOT_in NOT_a NOT_new NOT_hope .  they all do so well .  they are believable characters .  hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development .  fisher does a fine job being a female role model (i mean ,  come on! she killed jabba even when so many others had failed!) .  harrison ford - need i say more?<br /><br />the music is once again brilliant .  it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie .  the best climax is when luke shouts "nooo!" and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle .  john williams is nothing short of a genius! what an amazing man!<br /><br />already ,  the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i .  i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_finally NOT_see NOT_it NOT_in NOT_the NOT_theatres NOT_(can NOT_i NOT_wait???)

1654 0 blazing saddles! it's a fight between two estranged brothers (dennis quaid and arliss howard) ,  both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences ,  with dippy love-interest debra winger caught in the middle .  director glenn gordon caron (the tv whiz-kid behind "moonlighting") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in vince gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick ,  the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant .  it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature ,  but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities .  these aren't NOT_even NOT_characters ,  they're plot functions .  barely-released to theaters ,  the film is a disaster ,  although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good .  winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed .  *1/2 from **** 
1655 1 perspective is a good thing .  since the release of "star wars episode i: the phantom menace" ,  claims and counter-claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films ,  making them part of a cohesive whole ,  rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies .  what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films .  this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: "return of the jedi" .  often derided for its overly 'cute' factor ,  rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect "the empire strikes back" .  indeed the 'cute' element of rotj ,  namely the ewoks ,  remains a weak link in the entire series .  did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? only he can answer that question . <br /><br />this cute factor aside ,  the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga .  following on from the conclusion of "the empire strikes back" ,  luke skywalker (mark hamill) follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine ,  his home planet ,  to rescue han solo (harrison ford) ,  the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts . <br /><br />skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi (alec guiness) to fight the evil empire .  now swathed all in black ,  luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn .  his psychological make up is not NOT_as NOT_strong NOT_as NOT_his NOT_outward NOT_appearance NOT_would NOT_suggest .  while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends ,  he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again ,  despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side . <br /><br />early scenes in tatooine are impressive ,  from jabba's lair ,  to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand .  lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac ,  making it look fake and overdone . <br /><br />the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding ,  and is one of the more memorable of the saga .  luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies ,  proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete . <br /><br />when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time ,  the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime .  undoubtably the star of "the empire strikes back" ,  yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen . <br /><br />rotj really is luke's film ,  perhaps even more so than the original .  his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate .  the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow .  the romance between leia (carrie fisher) and solo is all but non-existant ,  unlike in "empire" .  in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj ,  solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films . <br /><br />their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion .  this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction .  the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all ,  while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) darth vader .  the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film ,  less cunning than governor tarkin (peter cushing) from "star wars" ,  more deeply psychologically dark than anything else .  played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid ,  the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate . <br /><br />all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles .  hamill surprises as the more wisened luke ,  making his character's progression from whiny teenager ,  impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series .  ford's role is waring thin ,  as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the real star of the first film after all .  fisher's leia is more of a prop ,  at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never NOT_sure NOT_about .  .  .  add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi ,  yoda and the loveable chewbacca ,  c-3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast . <br /><br />despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire ,  it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on endor ,  in space and on the death star ,  each with very impressive special effects .  the music ,  as always ,  is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance .  just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for "2001: a space odyssey" ,  john williams' score is as much a part of "star wars" folklore as light sabers and the force . <br /><br />lucas left the ending open to interpretation ,  meaning there could have been more episodes made .  indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii ,  viii and ix in their heads over and over again .  rotj works when given a chance ,  and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series . <br /><br />when all six episodes get to be viewed together ,  this saga could well be the best ever made .  is it already? the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series .  this is why "return of the jedi" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release . 
1656 0 let's see .  in the "st .  elsewhere" finale we found out that there was no NOT_hospital NOT_and NOT_that NOT_every NOT_thing NOT_had NOT_been NOT_in NOT_the NOT_mind NOT_of NOT_an NOT_autistic NOT_child .  "newhart" ended by telling us that it had all been a dream .  and "roseanne" ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind .  very "creative" .  annoying was more like it .  yes ,  it was just a tv show and wasn't NOT_at NOT_all NOT_reality .  it's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all "real" .  at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen .  this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat ,  frustrating and simply not NOT_fun NOT_to NOT_watch .  now "newhart" being all a dream? at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show .  the idea itself was not NOT_too NOT_engaging NOT_but NOT_it NOT_was NOT_so NOT_brilliantly NOT_done NOT_that NOT_its NOT_arguably NOT_the NOT_best NOT_series NOT_finale NOT_ever .  roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan . 
1657 1 i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 ,  but that this one isn't NOT_even NOT_in NOT_the NOT_top NOT_100 . <br /><br />this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks ,  but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br /><br />-the rescue of han solo from jabba: this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope . <br /><br />-the emperor was finally revealled: well alright this might not NOT_work NOT_as NOT_well NOT_now NOT_that NOT_the NOT_prequels NOT_are NOT_out NOT_but NOT_this NOT_was NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time NOT_we NOT_saw NOT_the NOT_emperor NOT_as NOT_kids . <br /><br />-the speeder bike chase: alright ,  so this was a special effects moment .  but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br /><br />-the 3 part climax: 1) the battle of endor (led by han and leia) 2) luke confronts his father & the fall of the emperor 3) the destruction of the second death star (lando's moment)<br /><br />-the final celebration with our heroes: like i said ,  this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire ,  our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other . <br /><br />all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story . 
1658 0 i heard about this film and knew it wasn't NOT_real NOT_good .  but i started watching the film (on my film-channel)and was interested .  this could be a really great ,  darkly black satire on todays morals in media .  the small featurettes on every contestent were good .  it build up to something i wouldn't NOT_wanna NOT_miss .  but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible ,  cheap and rather silly .  here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think .  but instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb . <br /><br />the ending is so bad i give it a 1 .  even if the film starts of promising . 
1659 1 i will admit ,  i thought this movie wasn't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_any NOT_good NOT_but NOT_i NOT_soon NOT_changed NOT_my NOT_mind .  the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going .  pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man ,  who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help .  greg kinnear is an awesome straight man ,  as his role as a mild mannered man from denver ,  who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar .  the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex) . <br /><br />the imaginary in this movie is very well done ,  especially at the bullfight scene & when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs . 
1660 0 i really don't NOT_understand NOT_all NOT_these NOT_positive NOT_user NOT_reviews .  this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_be NOT_pessimistic . <br /><br />eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film .  but i don't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_is NOT_her NOT_own NOT_fault NOT_but NOT_the NOT_directors .  he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting ,  the idea ,  the make-up ,  everything . <br /><br />the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie ,  which was very bad executed . <br /><br />don't watch this bullshit ,  go watch a fellini ,  woody allen or some david lynch . 
1661 1 i didn't NOT_have NOT_many NOT_expectation NOT_going NOT_into NOT_the NOT_film ,  but i thought it was fantastic .  pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role .  he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor .  pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great ,  and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time .  the humor is dark ,  the performances by brosnan ,  kinnear ,  and hope davis are great ,  mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship ,  and you have a great film .  this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time .  this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-bond era of brosnan's career . 
1662 0 live! yes ,  but not NOT_kicking . <br /><br />true story: some time ago ,  a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show .  a contest rather .  the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure .  for real . <br /><br />the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd ,  saying it was appalling ,  immoral ,  what-is-this-world-coming-to ,  and the like .  in a way ,  i had to agree . <br /><br />as the months passed ,  the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not ,  instead of running the country . <br /><br />the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead .  and up to the last moment the country was up in arms ,  the prime minister making speeches ,  every newspaper writing about it ,  everyone in the country holding their breaths .  and the network pushed on .  towards a new frontier in television .  and they definitely succeeded in doing just that .  they pushed the envelope . <br /><br />the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live ,  whilst she would die shortly after . <br /><br />and then ,  in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax .  the woman was not NOT_ill ,  but all the candidates were .  there was no NOT_kidney NOT_auction .  the whole show ,  that ,  with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions ,  built up for months to a fantastic climax ,  was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors .  the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease . <br /><br />now this is television .  leaving everybody far behind in amazement . <br /><br />don't give me a poorly acted ,  poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tv . <br /><br />as if . <br /><br />*spoiler* as if i'm going to believe they would get this through the fcc .  as if i'm going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression .  as if i'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air . <br /><br />it's all been done before .  watch running man with arnold instead .  at least it had a semi good ending . <br /><br />*spoiler* this is an appallingly bad piece of film ,  together with a ridiculous ending .  so she gets shot in the end ,  is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? don't NOT_take NOT_my NOT_word NOT_for NOT_it ,  but i would say this: leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead ,  you'll get more quality . 
1663 1 i saw this movie while it was under limited release ,  mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache ,  but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year .  it starts out almost as a thriller ,  but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one-liners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear .  also ,  while i say this movie is a comedy ,  it doesn't NOT_forget NOT_it NOT_has NOT_a NOT_heart NOT_at NOT_times NOT_and NOT_can NOT_be NOT_very NOT_touching NOT_when NOT_it NOT_needs NOT_to NOT_be .  when i went into the theater i didn't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_to NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_moustache ,  but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time .  leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release .  i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big moustache . 
1664 0 i give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted .  but i couldn't get past the implausibility of the whole thing . <br /><br />first and foremost ,  a game built around the notion of "russian roulette" that has to fill on hour .  the big problem is that if you are doing a "live" show ,  you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the "real" bullet .  then what do you do? you have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show .  the corollary is that okay ,  you get to the end and the first five contestants survive ,  which means number six has the bullet and can't NOT_possibly NOT_get NOT_the NOT_payout .  he isn't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_shoot NOT_himself NOT_at NOT_that NOT_point ,  so it's kind of anti-climatic .  <br /><br />second problem ,  almost as big .  human nature .  people are going to flinch ,  panic ,  soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not NOT_make NOT_very NOT_good NOT_television .  too much randomness .  that's why "real" reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited . <br /><br />(the only random thing is the "performance artist's" rant about female sacrifices ,  which were actually rare historically .  even that was predictable ,  since she went through with shooting herself to no NOT_effect . ) <br /><br />we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 am in the morning (unlikely) with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratings . <br /><br />a point on race and sex .  big surprise the movies two minority (one gay) and two female contestants are the ones who survive .  so we are left with the two white males ,  and of course ,  the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it .  the purpose of such a show would be it's randomness ,  but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies . <br /><br />the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide ,  the eva mendes character (mendes produced and starred in this thing ,  so she has no NOT_one NOT_to NOT_blame NOT_but NOT_herself) NOT_actually NOT_grows NOT_a NOT_conscience NOT_when NOT_someone NOT_dies .  what did she think was going to happen? she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing (motives never NOT_explained) NOT_and NOT_the NOT_show NOT_went NOT_on NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_big NOT_hit .  really? <br /><br />the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous (like network) .  this is neither . 
1665 1 interesting how much more realistic brosnan's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films .  he's neurotic ,  paranoid ,  an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot .  this is perfect break for him ,  even so much as to make fun of the bond icon .  "i'm a mess ,  a parody of myself" he says .  it doesn't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_better NOT_than NOT_that .  i just finished reading dr . no NOT_and NOT_this NOT_is NOT_very NOT_much NOT_how NOT_ian NOT_fleming NOT_had NOT_portrayed NOT_james NOT_bond .  personally i never NOT_liked NOT_brosnan NOT_as NOT_bond NOT_because NOT_he NOT_fit NOT_the NOT_icon NOT_too NOT_closely .  there was nothing for him to personalize the character with ,  as compared to roger moore or sean connery .  its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall .  a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no NOT_background NOT_dealing NOT_with .  it's an impressive portrayal ,  and having greg kinear to ground him ,  is just poetic .  this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in "my blue heaven" ,  but more genuine in their coping mechanisms . 
1666 0 there really wasn't NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_story NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film .  it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie .  it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness .  but there isn't NOT_much NOT_more NOT_than NOT_that . <br /><br />it mixes some scenes from the original ,  then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit .  but still ,  is that it? i was hoping for something a little more .  instead ,  all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation . <br /><br />i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe ,  then this is it .  but other than that ,  it does little justice for the animators .  disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions .  it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham .  "d-" 
1667 1 first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots .  i really enjoyed them .  i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan ,  greg kinear is pretty lackluster .  brosnan melts into this character so well ,  that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond .  it also shows his range and depth as an actor .  it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year .  i found the characters to be well crafted .  the twist in the middle i felt was especially good .  i also liked how the characters come off realistically .  so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not NOT_really NOT_characters NOT_but NOT_walking-stereotypes .  .  .  i like the different approaches this movie takes .  i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall .  .  . 
1668 0 i found this to be an utter waste of time ,  effort and money .  i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making "straight-to-video" films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is an all-time low .  .  . soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a "new version of the movie we all love . " nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again .  timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original "lion king" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened .  .  . as they see it . <br /><br />of course timon is now the hero of the story ,  yadda yadda yadda ,  blah blah blah .  .  . <br /><br />the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap .  the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature ,  but then again ,  when was the last time you remember matthew broderick ,  whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance? overall if you liked the original you'll hate this .  it's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike .  and that about sums it up . 
1669 1 dark comedy? gallows humor? how does one make a comedy out of murder? it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people .  so ,  the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work .  so ,  pierce brosnan ,  the irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking ,  sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis .  he meets a struggling businessman ,  greg kinnear ,  and after a rocky beginning ,  he learns that he needs a friend .  but ,  greg's happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't NOT_have ,  love ,  home and a life .  add character actor ,  philip baker hall as the hit-man's manager and we're off to the races .  brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart ,  the very human businessman .  hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives .  the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it .  you should leave the theater feeling ,  at least ,  partly good-- if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people . 
1670 0 having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly .  i thought lion king 1 . 5 might be worth watching .  what a disappointment ! disney must be getting desperate for revenues . <br /><br />especially now that they lost the deal with pixar . <br /><br />basically ,  they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make a<br /><br />quick buck .  unlike lk i & ii ,  both of which had strong story lines . <br /><br />this movie hardly has a story at all .  while the characters and animation are always fun to look at ,  there is simply not NOT_enough NOT_material NOT_here NOT_for NOT_a NOT_movie .  some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings . <br /><br />disney - shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!<br /><br />next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work . 
1671 1 pierce brosnan the newest but no NOT_longer NOT_james NOT_bond ,  is an assassin .  he is very very good at what he does ,  but he's getting old and tired .  greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man .  now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives .  then one night they are having drinks in a bar ,  and they begin to talk .  then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events .  the story is excellent ,  the acting is top notch ,  and the humor is hilarious i never NOT_thought NOT_that NOT_pierce NOT_brosnan NOT_would NOT_be NOT_this NOT_funny ,  but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see . 
1672 0 a dedicated fan to the tlk movies ,  with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced ,  along comes this film .  .  .  now i'm not NOT_arguing NOT_with NOT_animation ,  voice work ,  music ,  but this is no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_timon/pumbaa NOT_screwloose NOT_in NOT_the NOT_tlk NOT_atmosphere .  although it isn't NOT_bad ,  it doesn't NOT_add NOT_anything .  basically this movie is one big joke .  .  .  and that's about all that saves it .  make a real tlk3 ,  disney! the potential is there . <br /><br />4/10 
1673 1 this will not NOT_likely NOT_be NOT_voted NOT_best NOT_comedy NOT_of NOT_the NOT_year ,  a few too many coincidences and plot holes .  however we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise .  brosnan is excellent in this role ,  gone is the wooden james bond (a role he was wasted in) .  if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies .  greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan's straight man .  i've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within .  there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing .  my father (a consultant) nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a "facilitator" .  much like "grosse pointe blank" ,  another hit-man comedy ,  the humour can be very dark .  if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself . 
1674 0 i saw and liked the first two a lot ,  really .  especially because the second is not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_try NOT_to NOT_make NOT_another NOT_one NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_the NOT_first .  and it's a story standing alone .  you don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_know NOT_the NOT_first NOT_movie .  i liked that in the "free willy" movies ,  too . <br /><br />but .  .  .  the third ,  here is absolutely useless! i tried it with a friend of mine ,  because we both liked the first two .  we decided to stop after a good half an hour .  the movie is okay ,  there are funny parts in it alright .  but what for? timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies .  what lion king 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already ,  plus telling the story from their point of view .  but what for? i'd really like to know .  you know ,  the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one ,  is really nice .  but what comes after is mostly unnecessary .  i guess many people liked timon and pumba ,  and so do i really .  yet ,  for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny .  no NOT_chance ,  most of it wasn't NOT_funny NOT_at NOT_all ,  at least for me .  btw .  what was the movie about anyway? was it a) about timon and pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it . <br /><br />if you like to see stories like: "the story behind xy" ,  you should see "rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead" by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman .  that's really funny and no NOT_try NOT_to NOT_get NOT_more NOT_out NOT_of NOT_"hamlet" NOT_then NOT_it NOT_has . 
1675 1 "the matador" is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow ,  happily-married american businessman (greg kinnear) in mexico .  although the sardonic julian (ironically surnamed "noble") appears to be a "tough guy" on the surface ,  underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities ,  a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless .  thus on his birthday ,  he reaches out to danny ,  a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian's "unconventional" lifestyle .  in fact ,  both men find in each other the person they could never NOT_be NOT_but NOT_wish NOT_they NOT_could NOT_become NOT_in NOT_their NOT_quieter ,  franker moments of self-evaluation . <br /><br />although the film is a bit too reminiscent of "analyze this" and "midnight run" to feel entirely fresh and original ,  "the matador , " nevertheless ,  earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting .  brosnan ,  looking aged and almost used up ,  sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never NOT_has NOT_before .  playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being ,  brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment ,  then genuine and sympathetic the next .  he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never NOT_becomes NOT_crass NOT_or NOT_stale .  kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens .  hope davis does a fine job as "bean , " danny's loyal and loving wife who ,  like her husband ,  finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and "dangerous" figure from a world far different from the one she knows . <br /><br />at times ,  we find ourselves feeling that "the matador" is holding something back from us ,  not NOT_quite NOT_plumbing NOT_the NOT_depths NOT_of NOT_its NOT_situation NOT_and NOT_premise .  at the end it feels a little too light ,  a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should .  this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director richard shephard ,  and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet .  still ,  one appreciates the fact that he doesn't NOT_always NOT_go NOT_for NOT_the NOT_obvious NOT_and NOT_that NOT_he NOT_keeps NOT_tightly NOT_focused NOT_on NOT_the NOT_two NOT_main NOT_figures NOT_in NOT_the NOT_piece ,  rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh . <br /><br />'the matador" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will ,  hopefully ,  signal a new phase in brosnan's acting career . 
1676 0 [contains spoilers!!!]<br /><br /> timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king .  timon decides to go back before the beginning ,  to when the story really began .  so they go back .  way back .  back even before simba was born .  back to timon's old home which was miles away from pride rock .  a clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas .  the worst digger in the clan was a pompous ,  self-centered meerkat named timon .  his mother took pity on him but uncle max just shook his head .  mother suggested putting timon on sentry duty; timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere .  just then ,  hyenas shenzi ,  bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max .  that did it .  the other meerkats just wanted timon to go away while timon took it upon himself to leave .  so he kissed his mom goodbye and started off .  he didn't NOT_get NOT_very NOT_far NOT_before NOT_he NOT_started NOT_getting NOT_homesick .  just then he met rafiki ,  who taught him to look beyond what he sees .  timon had no NOT_clue NOT_what NOT_that NOT_meant NOT_so NOT_he NOT_continued NOT_on NOT_and NOT_met NOT_a NOT_warthog NOT_named NOT_pumbaa ,  who was all alone due to a flatulence problem .  timon and pumbaa join up then ,  but timon declared them acquaintances ,  rather than friends . <br /><br /> they soon arrive at pride rock where all the zebras ,  antelopes ,  wildebeests ,  rhinoceroses ,  giraffe's ,  elephants and many other plain animals had gathered .  what was going on? timon didn't NOT_care .  they pressed on .  timon then saw rafiki atop pride rock lifting into the air something he couldn't see .  just then all the animals took a bow .  was this to honor the birth of the new king? no ,  pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new homes ,  but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream .  when they reach land ,  timon decides to give up .  but then they gaze around at their newfound paradise .  it was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see .  timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from rafiki: hakuna matata .  timon and pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into simba .  they take him under their wing and become father figures .  they teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests .  pretty soon ,  a teenage simba takes on timon in a snail slurping contest .  simba won ,  leaving timon deathly ill . <br /><br /> then one day ,  simba's childhood friend nala arrived .  timon and pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship .  suddenly ,  simba runs away .  nala and pumbaa race after him ,  but not NOT_timon .  he chose to stay at "hakuna matata" by himself ,  until rafiki "talked" some sense into him ,  so he joins his friends at pride rock .  timon's mother and uncle max arrive then .  while simba battles scar ,  mother and max dig a large hole to trap hyenas shenzi ,  bonzai and ed in .  it worked .  scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas .  then all is well .  mother ,  uncle max and the rest of the meerkats go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise that is hakuna matata .  back to the present ,  timon and pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly mother ,  uncle max ,  simba and rafiki want to watch it again .  so do mickey mouse ,  donald duck ,  goofy ,  snow white ,  the seven dwarfs ,  dumbo ,  peter pan ,  the lost boys ,  mad hatter ,  march hare ,  genie ,  aladdin ,  and jasmine . <br /><br /> well ,  i must say that the lion king 1 1/2 wasn't NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_i NOT_had NOT_hoped .  it was too ridiculous and silly .  the original lion king was a masterpiece .  it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in .  this one was just silly and made a mockery of it .  i swear ,  sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed .  they're overplayed to the point of no NOT_longer NOT_being NOT_funny ,  just annoying .  the original voice cast is back: nathan lane as timon ,  ernie sabella as pumbaa ,  matthew broddrick as adult simba ,  whoopi goldberg as shenzi ,  cheech marin as bonzai ,  jim cummings as ed ,  robert guillame as rafiki .  new to the cast are julie kavner of tv's (too) long running series the simpsons as timon's mom and jerry stiller as uncle max .  so anyway ,  this movie isn't NOT_the NOT_lion NOT_king NOT_iii ,  and it isn't NOT_ii NOT_because NOT_there NOT_already NOT_is NOT_a NOT_ii .  it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away .  hence ,  it's 1 1/2 .  in conclusion ,  i don't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_to NOT_die NOT_hard NOT_lion NOT_king NOT_fans NOT_because NOT_it's NOT_far NOT_too NOT_ridiculous NOT_and NOT_frivilous .  however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them .  i hope this will also be the last lion king movie .  two is enough .  "the lion king 1 1/2" .  what we've come to expect from disney sequel makers . <br /><br />- 
1677 1 ***1/2 pierce brosnan ,  greg kinnear ,  hope davis ,  adam scott ,  philip baker hall .  directed by richard shepard . <br /><br />a well formulated story and film all together ,  brosnan has never NOT_been NOT_better NOT_in NOT_a NOT_film NOT_role NOT_outside NOT_of NOT_his NOT_"bond" NOT_movies .  after 2004's "after the sunset" his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time .  professional hit-man ,  so to speak ,  julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright (kinnear ,  possibly one of his best roles) also on business there .  the two on-screen duo produce a comically charged ,  laugh riot and fail to not NOT_deliver NOT_the NOT_laughs .  davis in one of her best roles since "american splendor" gives another charming and witty performance .  one of the years most enjoyable and best films .  my final rating 9/10 
1678 0 the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid .  at least all i lost was $3 . 00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb .  the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat .  when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location ,  mr .  fbi handed the female a revolver .  when the alleged killer came out the door ,  the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic .  one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian? i think not .  ms .  xavier appears to be a very attractive female .  it is too bad the r rating did not NOT_allow NOT_much NOT_of NOT_her NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seen .  it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out . 
1679 1 think pierce brosnan and you think suave ,  dapper ,  intelligent james bond .  in this movie ,  brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so (as does the audience) .  this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman .  .  .  and it works!<br /><br />this is a fun movie ,  with very good scenes (a riveting ,  on-the-edge brosnan and a good ,  compliant "off"-the-edge kinnear have some good lines) .  my only cavil is that hope davis ,  playing the oh-so-tolerant wife ("can i see your gun?") doesn't NOT_appear NOT_more NOT_often: NOT_she NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been NOT_a NOT_marvellous NOT_foil NOT_to NOT_these NOT_men . <br /><br />this movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience ,  while "going for a kill" .  the ending is awesome because a storyline (with a positive moral!) emerges: this is a frenetic ,  frantic and fun movie ,  which does deserve a wide audience . 
1680 0 i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made  . i too had to fast forward through most of this movie .  michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone . the picture quality is grainy all the way through  . and what little plot there is , is just plain stupid  . i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would  . don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_on NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_or NOT_you'll NOT_regret NOT_it . 
1681 1 wasn't NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_to NOT_expect NOT_from NOT_this NOT_film .  i love watching brosnan in any movie ,  he's always good ,  but this was totally different .  he's a mess ,  and plays being a mess very well .  in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni :) so yes ,  there's not NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_violence ,  there's not NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_action ,  but the dialogue is cracking ,  the acting is superb and very refreshing ,  and it's pretty funny too :) i don't NOT_think NOT_you'll NOT_come NOT_out NOT_of NOT_the NOT_cinema NOT_going NOT_"wow! NOT_i NOT_was NOT_blown NOT_away" ,  but you'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film .  can't NOT_ask NOT_for NOT_more NOT_than NOT_that . <br /><br />oh ,  and if you're lucky ,  some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you'll get inverted ,  upside down ,  reversed (with reversed audio) adverts!! brilliant .  nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american "twin peaks" commentary :) 
1682 0 i just watched this film 15 minutes ago ,  and i still have no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_i NOT_just NOT_watched .  mainly i think it's a film about an internet s&m "star" of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online .  she's murdered by someone ,  which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death .  the local homicide division of big city ,  usa is also investigating ,  though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic "as the real thing" .  i know .  wow . <br /><br />michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him .  he's in the film for about 15 minutes ,  and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no NOT_apparent NOT_reason .  i won't NOT_even NOT_explain NOT_the NOT_ending ,  because quite frankly i can't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_out NOT_myself .  but before the final scene ,  we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film .  honestly ,  they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all . <br /><br />all in all ,  stay away from this film .  i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen .  i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied .  like ,  playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly .  that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining . 
1683 1 i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy .  brosnan is genius; as anyone will now testify ,  he is not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_pigeonholed NOT_in NOT_the NOT_bond NOT_role .  kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role .  i don't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_i've NOT_laughed NOT_as NOT_hard NOT_during NOT_any NOT_movie! NOT_what NOT_an NOT_unexpected NOT_pleasure! NOT_my NOT_favourite NOT_line NOT_would NOT_be NOT_'i NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_a NOT_bangkok NOT_hooker NOT_on NOT_a NOT_sunday NOT_after NOT_the NOT_navy NOT_left NOT_town' .  brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse .  i was also very impressed with hope davis's performance .  it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy .  if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man' ,  you will definitely like this .  <br /><br />i voted 10 . 
1684 0 this is not NOT_michael NOT_madsen's NOT_fault ,  he was hardly in it .  this movie was just awful .  if you want to laugh and be bored ,  go ahead and watch this movie .  words cannot describe how idiotic it is .  sorry michael .  the cinematography was dark .  all the other actors are unknowns .  when watching it ,  it feels like a soft porn ,  but with no NOT_nudity NOT_or NOT_heated NOT_scenes .  this movie had sexual overtones ,  since it is about a underground s & m killer .  the acting was bad ,  except michael madsen's parts .  he looked like he wanted to laugh .  i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie .  it is something i would not NOT_be NOT_proud NOT_of .  it is not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_b NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_cable ,  it is more like a f and it should never NOT_be NOT_shown ,  ever . 
1685 1 the matador is a witty ,  dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan ,  who has never NOT_ever NOT_been NOT_better NOT_than NOT_here ,  and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack nicholson's gay neighbor in as good as it gets .  a big plus goes to the writing as well .  clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way .  the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next . <br /><br />nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music ,  clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't NOT_quite NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_label NOT_the NOT_film .  but that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat . 
1686 0 a bdsm "sub-culture" of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess ,  plainly a vanity piece for its top-billed player ,  celia xavier ,  who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia .  a question soon develops as to whether or not NOT_some NOT_rather NOT_immoderate NOT_camera ,  lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not NOT_be NOT_taken NOT_seriously NOT_by NOT_a NOT_sensate NOT_viewer .  celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles ,  while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cd-roms ,  but when disaster befalls "mistress vanessa" ,  virtuous celia ,  determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker ,  begins a new job as a "sex slave" at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a "dungeon party" .  two fbi field agents (whose deployment to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm sites) ,  in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective ,  are assigned to investigate the crime ,  while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her .  flaws in logic and continuity abound ,  such as a homicide being allocated to l . a . p . d . 's operations-south bureau ,  a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film .  direction is unfocused and not NOT_aided NOT_by NOT_erratic NOT_post-production NOT_editing NOT_and NOT_sound NOT_reproduction .  the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario .  one solid acting turn appears among this slag: stan abe as a zealous fbi agent . 
1687 1 not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_easily NOT_pierce NOT_brosnon's NOT_best NOT_performance .  of course greg kinnear is always great .  really ,  when has he really been bad? i think this film is incredibly underrated! the use of colors in this movie is something very different in today's film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter .  i also love the way they used the song by asia .  proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly . <br /><br />i was making my first feature when this came out .  being that my film was a hit-man movie ,  i had to check out anything in the genre that was released .  after seeing it ,  i'm sure it had some effect on me through the process .  it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine .  how any of the others relate i have no NOT_idea ,  making an even more interesting coincidence . <br /><br />http://www . imdb . com/title/tt1337580/ 
1688 0 this has to be the worst movie i have seen .  madsen fans don't NOT_be NOT_drawn NOT_into NOT_this NOT_like NOT_i NOT_was .  he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes .  this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t . v .  had been destroyed . 
1689 1 a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives .  this is an odd film that works ,  an impressive effort for writer-director shepard .  in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond ,  brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job ,  but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope .  kinnear is equally good as the salesman ,  a decent fellow with a void in his life .  davis is fine as kinnear's flirtatious wife .  mainly a character study ,  the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable ,  an extremely dark comedy . 
1690 0 it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb ,  because i would not NOT_have NOT_hesitated!

NOT_imagine NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_length NOT_'the NOT_bold NOT_and NOT_the NOT_beautiful' ,  well ,  primal instinct did not NOT_even NOT_come NOT_close NOT_to NOT_that NOT_good ,  and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful' .  <br /><br />michael madsen ,  how could you do this to us? the worst part is ,  i didn't NOT_fast NOT_forward NOT_a NOT_bit ,  i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke ,  that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film . <br /><br />where do i start .  .  . ? directing - zero stars ,  screenplay - zero stars ,  acting - zero stars ,  cinematography - zero stars ,  digital effects - zero stars ,  production design - zero stars ,  make-up - zero stars ,  casting - zero stars ,  editing - zero stars ,  trailer - half a star ,  graphic design - half a star ,  dvd menu - half a star . <br /><br />however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is ,  so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film ,  just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list . 
1691 1 the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it ,  it seems so light .  the humor is always medium-gauge ,  never NOT_unfunny NOT_but NOT_never NOT_gut-busting .  the story is a very simple thread .  the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features ,  namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight-laced glass-wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other's lifestyles .  i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary ,  as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself .  however ,  it really is a good film ,  because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time ,  it wasn't .  it has a subtle way of connecting with the audience . <br /><br />i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it's a formula that is nothing new ,  even most of the humor ,  both main characters ,  virtually the only characters in it ,  are somehow met and gotten to know .  forget calling them real .  that's not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_what NOT_i NOT_mean .  what i mean is that though pierce brosnan's filthy ,  womanizing ,  boozing hit man is a detached comical character ,  he's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan ,  who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air .  greg kinnear's character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness ,  but he's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later .  we then realize the film is not NOT_simply NOT_analyze NOT_this NOT_or NOT_planes ,  trains and automobiles told stalely over again .  its truly saying something . <br /><br />the film's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists .  but with its lightness ,  how can that possibly be the focus of the film ,  though the plot has been leading up to it? no ,  the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other .  strangely ,  the matador is a film about regret and loneliness .  brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day ,  and though we don't NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_kinnear NOT_is NOT_so NOT_lenient NOT_and NOT_accepting NOT_with NOT_brosnan NOT_continually NOT_interrupting NOT_his NOT_life ,  it's slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more down-to-earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption .  the very last scene of the movie stays with me .  it ,  i think ,  is where the film's subtle side-stepping impact finally begins to seep . 
1692 0 this has to be ,  by far ,  the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years .  when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films ,  and he was a pretty fair actor .  wrong! no NOT_one NOT_should NOT_waste NOT_their NOT_time NOT_on NOT_this NOT_film .  i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don't NOT_feel NOT_that NOT_i NOT_missed NOT_a NOT_thing . 
1693 1 two years ago i watched "the matador" in cinema and i loved everything about this movie .  obviously ,  i was totally under impression of pierce brosan's magnificent role .  yesterday ,  i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper .  now ,  i can say with certain that this movie isn't NOT_that NOT_special NOT_but NOT_you NOT_just NOT_gotta' NOT_love NOT_it NOT_because NOT_of NOT_one NOT_man .  <br /><br />brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble ,  tired hit-man who has no NOT_friends .  soon julian meets danny wright (greg kinnear) in mexico city ,  man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident ,  his job isn't NOT_going NOT_that NOT_well NOT_and NOT_he's NOT_not NOT_sure NOT_that NOT_he NOT_can NOT_keep NOT_his NOT_wife NOT_bean NOT_(hope NOT_davis) . <br /><br />i always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor .  mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d .  .  .  .  or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning ,  after the navy's left town . " brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually .  i also like greg 'typical american face' kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wright . <br /><br />so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever .  he'll make you smile and admire him at the same time .  great brosnan in not NOT_equally NOT_great NOT_movie .

1695 1 julian noble (pierce brosnan) is a hit-man .  or a "facilitator of fatalities" ,  as he prefers to be called .  he is also a drunk ,  a womaniser ,  and in the middle of a mid-life crisis .  on a job in mexico city ,  he bumps into danny white (greg kinnear) ,  an unconfident businessman who thinks he's just nailed a recent pitch ,  but is unsure .  they meet in the hotel bar late one night ,  after they've both had a few too many margaritas . <br /><br />sounds like the set-up for a by-the-numbers comedy thriller ,  doesn't NOT_it? NOT_but NOT_it NOT_isn't .  instead ,  the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study .  it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest ,  sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down .  it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it ,  without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances . <br /><br />brosnan's hit-man will inevitably be compared to his bond ,  but this is unfair to both performances .  bond is a half-formed idea ,  a product of all that has gone before; while julian is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws .  he has existed in his own shadowy ,  seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being . <br /><br />when he meets danny in the hotel bar ,  he sees his opposite: a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems .  he envies danny; the hit-man has become fed up with his life ,  sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable "burn out" ,  as he puts it .  but when danny opens up about the death of his only son ,  julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke .  he is a man who has ,  in his own words ,  been "running from any emotion . " kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan's performance ,  and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm .  he is the perfect foil to julian; while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism ,  danny is down to earth ,  with just a hint of eccentricity .  but he too goes deeper than his established persona ,  showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruin . <br /><br />there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear .  it is most visible in the film's three key scenes: the hotel bar; a bullfight ,  during which julian tells danny what he does for a living ,  and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination; and a scene in which julian turns up at danny's house six months later .  this scene also introduces us properly to danny's wife ,  bean (yes ,  bean) .  in another example of how much the matador respects its characters ,  bean (hope davis) ,  instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house ,  merely asks with forced calm ,  "did you bring your gun?" the script isn't NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been NOT_after NOT_maybe NOT_another NOT_rewrite .  one or two lines seem a little forced ,  and a couple of the jokes need a little more work .  but in the scenes where julian and danny (and later bean) just talk ,  the writing is superb .  the film feels no NOT_need NOT_to NOT_put NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_in NOT_any NOT_outlandish NOT_situations NOT_(other NOT_than NOT_meeting NOT_a NOT_hit-man ,  and said hit-man turning up on your doorstep) .  it just lets them talk ,  gently nudging them toward necessary plot points . <br /><br />there is action ,  but only when it reflects on the characters .  one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope .  the rest of the film is about the characters ,  how they interact ,  how they each affect one another .  and ,  ultimately ,  it is about friendship ,  even in the most unlikely of places .  at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend .  and he really means it . 
1696 0 ok ,  if you're looking for another bastketball diaries ,  this is completely the wrong film . <br /><br />i revolves around two brothers .  max ,  the younger ,  has a major cocaine addiction .  adam ,  the eldest ,  is a doctor .  this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible .  it however ,  does not .  it shows that cocaine can be fun no NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_the NOT_situation NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_be NOT_present .  most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways .  eventually adam ,  can no NOT_longer NOT_take NOT_the NOT_stress NOT_from NOT_his NOT_job NOT_and NOT_begins NOT_to NOT_use NOT_as NOT_well NOT_(perscription NOT_drugs) . <br /><br />this movie has almost no NOT_climax .  doesn't NOT_descend NOT_into NOT_what NOT_cocaine NOT_really NOT_does NOT_to NOT_you ,  has boring and low-budget scenes ,  and the acting of the eldest brother ,  adam ,  is horrific . <br /><br />i have no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_has NOT_managed NOT_to NOT_pass NOT_and NOT_receive NOT_awards ,  it is not NOT_a NOT_heart-wencher .  if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent ,  if not NOT_buy NOT_'the NOT_basketball NOT_diaries' .  and notice the difference . <br /><br />try to avoid this movie but ,  if you think you will enjoy .  try and see for yourself .  .  . 
1697 1 the turning point in "the matador" comes about half through the movie when danny ,  an unsophisticated man from denver ,  is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel ,  enjoying a quiet moment .  someone knocks on his door ,  and knowing it's julian ,  the paid assassin ,  he refuses to answer .  but did he really? <br /><br />richard shephard ,  the director of "the matador" ,  presents us with a character ,  julian noble ,  who shows no NOT_redeemable NOT_qualities .  in fact ,  we have already seen him in action ,  doing what he does best .  when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city ,  he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living . <br /><br />danny ,  who has come to sell his program to a mexican company ,  but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract .  danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian .  it's not NOT_until NOT_some NOT_time NOT_later ,  on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson .  it's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way . <br /><br />pierce brosnan ,  acting against type ,  makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble .  just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character .  greg kinnear ,  on the other hand ,  plays the straight part of this odd couple .  hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't NOT_she NOT_stay NOT_longer .  philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments . <br /><br />richard shephard directs with style working with his own material .  the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything . 
1698 0 one star .  that's all this documentary deserves .  i haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie ,  let alone a documentary ,  in quite some time . <br /><br />i'm a big fan of the "walking with .  .  . " series ,  including it's nigel marvin spin-offs ,  for all their gleeful fun yet informative information .  and although the subject of prehistoric man has never NOT_interested NOT_me NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_other NOT_prehistoric NOT_creatures ,  the subject is still interesting and unique to explore .  having seen all the other docs from the series ,  i figured i need to see this one as well ,  especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places . <br /><br />well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc .  .  .  what were you thinking?! lol . <br /><br />though the information that they were able to get through was interesting ,  the presentation failed in every other way possible .  it had a terrible flow ,  was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say (with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place) ,  horrible effects (that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects) ,  and overused mtv-style camera effects . <br /><br />speaking of the makeup effects ,  one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie .  well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous .  none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions . <br /><br />the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way ,  or looks remotely real .  it doesn't NOT_even NOT_look NOT_like NOT_it NOT_was NOT_taken NOT_seriously .  it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had .  remember the episode in "walking with dinosaurs" of the fate of the ornithochirus (sp?)? that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it .  it's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all .  when you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story ,  even one that is just speculation ,  you care more about the facts surrounding it . <br /><br />the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration (at least in the bbc version i saw) and the music .  otherwise ,  do not NOT_bother NOT_even NOT_renting NOT_this NOT_one NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_have NOT_a NOT_good NOT_laugh NOT_(which NOT_i NOT_did NOT_frequently ,  but usually followed by rolling eyes) .  this does not NOT_belong NOT_on NOT_the NOT_shelf NOT_with NOT_the NOT_other NOT_"walking NOT_with .  .  .

1699 1 the matador is a strange film .  its main character julian ,  played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan ,  is not NOT_your NOT_typical NOT_hero .  julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises .  having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely .  and so ,  after a chance meeting at a bar with danny (greg kinnear) ,  he latches on and begins a halting ,  awkward friendship .  danny ,  the quintessential nice guy ,  is dealing with some stuff in his own life and ,  truth be told ,  could use a friend as well .  the two make an unexpected connection ,  and danny sticks around to hear julian's story ,  even after learning the "unsavory" truth about julian's work . <br /><br />matador approaches a subject not NOT_completely NOT_unheard NOT_of NOT_in NOT_cinema ,  the anti-hero assassin (films like 'assassins' and 'grosse pointe blank' come to mind) .  but matador differs in several key ways .  first of all ,  the killing and gore is implied but never NOT_really NOT_shown NOT_in NOT_any NOT_detail ,  meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you .  and second ,  unlike most anti-hero films ,  matador makes no NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_show NOT_remorse NOT_and NOT_redemption NOT_from NOT_its NOT_main NOT_character .  julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing .  this is unusual ,  given that 99 . 99% of us would consider killing for money horrific .  and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic .  although we don't NOT_like NOT_to NOT_admit NOT_it ,  almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough ,  maybe even murder .  did julian's victims deserve to die? who is paying to have people killed? who knows .  the movie never NOT_deals NOT_with NOT_these NOT_questions .  the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship .  if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer ,  but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity .  sympathy for the devil ,  i guess . <br /><br />brosnan's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling .  he doesn't NOT_completely NOT_divorce NOT_himself NOT_from NOT_his NOT_james NOT_bond NOT_good NOT_looks NOT_and NOT_smooth NOT_charm ,  but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix .  weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance .  it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him .  it's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays ,  but it works .  the films only other major role ,  that of danny ,  is not NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_meaty .  kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems . <br /><br />the film doesn't NOT_really NOT_have NOT_any NOT_huge NOT_shocks NOT_or NOT_m NOT_night NOT_shyamalan NOT_twists ,  but i wasn't NOT_able NOT_to NOT_guess NOT_the NOT_ending NOT_and NOT_it NOT_felt NOT_satisfying .  it doesn't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_deep NOT_philosophical NOT_or NOT_spiritual NOT_insights NOT_and NOT_yet NOT_it NOT_felt NOT_very NOT_human .  and it didn't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_heart NOT_pounding NOT_car NOT_chases NOT_or NOT_gun NOT_battles NOT_and NOT_yet NOT_i NOT_thought NOT_the NOT_pacing NOT_was NOT_well NOT_done NOT_and NOT_i NOT_was NOT_never NOT_bored .  maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another ,  and how those needs have no NOT_moral NOT_prerequisites .  even a murderer needs friends ,  and even good people can be friends with bad people .  it's a comment on the strange ,  random world we live in .  a good film; worth seeing . 
1700 0 this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! first of all ,  the plot is stupid .  the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it .  we find that the kid has a gift ,  the "shining" .  this gift never NOT_ever NOT_has NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_anything NOT_except NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_kid NOT_seem NOT_cool .  then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy .  he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because .  .  .  well ,  he feels like it .  why else would he do it? all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub .  the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse ,  which is utterly disgusting .  somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe .  then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father ,  who dies within minutes of hypothermia .  most movies aren't NOT_a NOT_complete NOT_waste NOT_of NOT_time ,  but this falls right into that category .  the music is trashy ,  the characters are corny (except jack nicholson ,  who is a good actor) ,  the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit ,  the ending is very predictable ,  the storyline is slow ,  tedious ,  and boring .  this movie is extremely overrated .  avoid this movie at all costs .  i'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on imdb . 
1701 1 the matador (2005) *** _ pierce brosnan ,  greg kinnear ,  hope davis ,  philip baker hall ,  dylan baker .  brosnan gives one of his best non-bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman (kinnear at his most affable) and discovers there is more to life than death .  newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee .  a sleeper gem indie hit . 
1702 0 after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie ,  i knew what was supposed to happen .  i had high expectations of the movie ,  because of the rating .  the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie .  i have a couple main points for not NOT_liking NOT_this NOT_movie . <br /><br />********** spoilers **********<br /><br />1 .  the casting .  jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence's character .  also ,  i would have never NOT_picked NOT_shelly NOT_duvall NOT_for NOT_wendy .  i pictured wendy much differently .  i can see why they picked jack nicholson though ,  the grin ,  the pointy eyebrows ,  but he's not NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_really NOT_look NOT_'evil' .  he's supposed to look normal ,  and he turns evil .  also ,  they make one of the worst movie couples .  danny was alright ,  he needed more life though .  he acted way to droney . <br /><br />2 .  the screenplay .  they cut out so many things that were in the book ,  and added things .  some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted ,  changed ,  or handled wrongly .  some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals ,  the roque mallet ,  the elevator) were not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie ,  and it was 2 and half hours!! i was extremely irritated . <br /><br />3 .  the ending .  the ending was changed completly ,  halorann died ,  jack froze to death ,  wendy never NOT_got NOT_hurt .  .  . the overlook didn't NOT_blow NOT_up .  the ending was so cool in the book ,  and the movie messed it up so horribly ,  i was apalled .  hallorann was never NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_die ,  but jack killed him with an ax .  if they wanted to kill him ,  at least have jack use a roque mallet .  you never NOT_even NOT_saw NOT_a NOT_roque NOT_mallet NOT_during NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_movie . <br /><br />there are other things that i didn't NOT_like NOT_about NOT_the NOT_movie ,  but there are things that were all right .  the camera angels were cool ,  the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool ,  but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't NOT_go NOT_with NOT_the NOT_book ,  to try to be scared at all .  i reccomend reading the book ,  before you see this movie .  i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not NOT_dis NOT_stanley NOT_kubrik NOT_any NOT_more .  i would never NOT_have NOT_done NOT_that ,  i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day .  i can't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_6 NOT_hour NOT_version ,  at least it has the hedge animals . <br /><br />rating: 2/10 
1703 1 pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns ,  in an outrageous self-parody ,  as the aging foul-mouthed boozy assassin julian noble ,  who has a particular fondness for teenage girls ,  bullfights and tacky clothes .  during a job in mexico city he meets danny (greg kinnear) ,  a straight-faced denver suburban business-man ,  who's in town to make his deal of-a-life-time ,  in a hotel bar .  despite their completely different personalities and julian's crude and insensible remarks ,  they become friends .  <br /><br />largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear ,  director richard shepard revealed that he didn't NOT_write NOT_the NOT_film NOT_with NOT_pierce NOT_brosnan NOT_in NOT_mind NOT_ ,  but i can hardly imagine this without him .  he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or cold-war spies .  the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) really is a bravura piece of acting skills .  the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes ,  and although it was probably carefully scripted ,  the two actors are largely improvising ,  but they succeed wonderfully! it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting .  think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichã©s and the actors' own typecasting (brosnan's james bond in particular) ,  and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood .  <br /><br />sadly ,  the story wears thin after a while .  after an hour ,  the film just runs out of steam .  nevertheless ,  and i can't NOT_put NOT_my NOT_finger NOT_on NOT_it NOT_exactly ,  i did enjoy this very much .  it just feels very fresh and original ,  with some imaginative use of sets and lighting ,  and some hints to seijun suzuki and jean-pierre melville .  the other characters aren't NOT_given NOT_much NOT_to NOT_do ,  but this film does offer something new ,  in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof .  very amusing . <br /><br />camera obscura --- 7/10 
1704 0 i am going to keep this short . this "adaption" of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more . of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and , as a result , this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250 . <br /><br />jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall . the story , that has nothing to do with the book , is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes . <br /><br />my advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the tv series  .  .  .  . <br /><br />oh  , and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is .  .  . not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_writer NOT_should NOT_stick NOT_to NOT_reviewing NOT_"masterpieces" NOT_like NOT_"eyes NOT_wide NOT_shut" . 
1705 1 the matador is hit-man movie lite .  .  .  . if you can say that about a hit-man movie .  the violence is never NOT_really NOT_shown NOT_but NOT_often NOT_introduced .  at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship .  nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning .  the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together .  the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes .  this is a good film that i probably won't NOT_remember NOT_for NOT_too NOT_long NOT_but NOT_at NOT_the NOT_time NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_complete NOT_joy .  good film . 
1706 0 ok ,  honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great .  its really not .  there were two good things that came out of this movie 1 .  jack's performance ,  he was very good i can tip my hat for him .  2 .  danny's performance ,  he was good .  no NOT_other NOT_then NOT_that NOT_it NOT_got NOT_pretty NOT_stupid .  and ,  what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy? she was so bad .  she looked the same every time she got scared .  the problem with this movie was the ending .  i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently .  and ,  the over all movie was just stupid .  the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better .  so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off .  3/10 . 
1707 1 "the matador" stars pierce brosnan as a burned out assassin .  he's james bond gone to seed ,  in too-tight ,  garish clothes ,  gold chains ,  and an ugly haircut .  our struggling assassin ,  julian noble ,  is in mexico ,  trying to regain his nerve .  staying at the same hotel is a likable ,  down-on-his luck businessman danny wright (greg kinnear) ,  also trying to regain his equilibrium .  danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in denver (hope davis) with good news . <br /><br />noble and wright unexpectedly become friends .  wright convinces noble to reveal certain techniques ,  which he demonstrates at a bullfight .  noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in denver .  <br /><br />writer and director richard shepard did the q&a after this delightful movie at the austin film festival .  shepard was also down on his luck .  after suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts ,  he decided to write a story no NOT_one NOT_would NOT_buy NOT_and NOT_create NOT_a NOT_character NOT_no NOT_one NOT_would NOT_want NOT_to NOT_play .  then pierce brosnan called .  brosnan regains his equilibrium in this movie .  (there is life after bond!) he has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy .  don't NOT_miss NOT_it .  <br /><br />stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting .  i look forward to more of richard shepard's projects . 
1708 0 ladies and gentlemen , please don't NOT_get NOT_fooled NOT_by NOT_"a NOT_stanley NOT_kubrick" NOT_film NOT_tag . this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made . horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film . in shining , there is no NOT_real NOT_horror NOT_at NOT_all NOT_but NOT_what NOT_we NOT_find NOT_instead NOT_is NOT_just NOT_a NOT_naive , foolish attempt made to create chilling horror . everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality . all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley .  the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too . a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost , lazy soul who is never NOT_really NOT_sure NOT_of NOT_what NOT_he NOT_is NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_do . there is not NOT_much NOT_to NOT_be NOT_said NOT_of NOT_a NOT_bald , colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor . no NOT_need NOT_to NOT_blame NOT_the NOT_bad NOT_weather NOT_for NOT_the NOT_tragedy . it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not NOT_alive NOT_to NOT_make NOT_any NOT_changes . 
1709 1 "margaritas and cock .  .  . "<br /><br />this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never NOT_stops NOT_delivering NOT_laughs ,  surprises and unexpectedly touching moments .  i had more fun watching "the matador" than almost any other film from 2005 .  it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character ,  played to perfection by pierce brosnan . <br /><br />julian noble (brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs (assassinating rich dudes) .  he is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis .  after coming to realization that he has no NOT_real NOT_friends ,  no NOT_permanent NOT_home NOT_and NOT_no NOT_planned NOT_future ,  he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright (kinnear) . <br /><br />danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him .  he loves his wife dearly ,  especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier . <br /><br />the two men are chalk and cheese ,  hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night .  and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever . <br /><br />the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy .  one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble .  the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned ,  due in no NOT_small NOT_part NOT_to NOT_the NOT_wonderful NOT_performances NOT_from NOT_brosnan NOT_and NOT_kinnear . <br /><br />but make no NOT_mistake .  .  .  this is brosnan's film .  he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade .  he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him .  brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer ,  but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date .  i wouldn't NOT_be NOT_averse NOT_to NOT_seeing NOT_an NOT_oscar NOT_nod NOT_for NOT_this NOT_role . <br /><br />consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line ,  "all blushy blushy .  .  .  no NOT_sucky NOT_fucky" .  he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it .  he manages to tell a young boy ,  "tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years .  then get back to me" without coming across as unlikable .  in fact ,  it makes us like him even more . <br /><br />and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes ,  most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns .  however ,  when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday ,  or when danny and his wife (davis) console each other in their bedroom one night ,  the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion . <br /><br />"the matador" is stylish and energetic .  it is constantly entertaining .  and it contains a career-defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy ,  friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life .  this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible . <br /><br />tc candler of independentcritics . com 
1710 0 not NOT_the NOT_best NOT_of NOT_the NOT_films NOT_to NOT_be NOT_watched NOT_nowadays .  i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good .  but this movie disappointed me .  the sound and environment was good ,  but there was no NOT_story NOT_here .  not NOT_was NOT_there NOT_a NOT_single NOT_moment NOT_of NOT_fright .  i expected it to a horror thriller movie ,  but there was no NOT_horror NOT_no NOT_thriller .  the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing "wednesday" .  there are lots of fragments i the movie .  most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything .  the story does not NOT_tell NOT_us NOT_about NOT_the NOT_women NOT_or NOT_other NOT_scenes NOT_that NOT_is NOT_shown .  might be a good movie to watch in the 80's ,  but not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_21st NOT_century . 
1711 1 this film is fantastic .  finally well-written characters you can love for all their good and bad .  pierce brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role .  i think its the best thing he's ever done .  he's done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully-fledged work ,  but this role finally gave him the room to run with it .  i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots .  and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too ,  as well as actors to aspire too .  kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying .  you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back . 
1712 0 these writings write about the end of the plot so don't NOT_read NOT_it NOT_if NOT_you NOT_haven't NOT_seen NOT_this NOT_rubbish . <br /><br />i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror .  if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section .  this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks . <br /><br />this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary .  well i drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not NOT_scary .  it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving .  even the little kid does it too .  round and round he goes and he never NOT_stops .  what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? i think nothing and if you watch it you will not NOT_think NOT_so NOT_too . <br /><br />the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens .  then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no NOT_reason .  that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish . 
1713 1 the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission .  he plays a kind of "james bond's psycho twin brother" ,  separated at birth ,  no NOT_doubt .  as an intense hit-man ,  his character is very sexual but even better ,  very funny .  add the kind-hearted ,  uber-likable american "guy next door' ,  greg kinnear ,  to set up contrast .  the myriad locations ,  vivid colors ,  and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment .  hope davis is well cast as the "gem of a wife" .  but the focus of the film is on the two fellows ,  a new "odd couple" ,  and that's the part that works very well .  have a great (probably r-rated) laugh ,  and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper . 
1714 0 many king fans hate this because it departed from the book ,  but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump .  that notwithstanding ,  the movie does fail completely ,  but it fails entirely on film terms .  i'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made .  i always follow up with the question "really .  .  .  exactly what scene scared you?" every fan i've asked ,  goes silent .  occasionally someone ,  at a loss for a decent scare (there are none .  .  . ) ,  names the "grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators" shtick .  if you're afraid of that ,  i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_you ,  except maybe that you're easily scared .  i just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky ,  incoherent movie . <br /><br />one place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down .  really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film .  <br /><br />oh ,  and nice choice for mr .  halloran's artwork stanley! black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie .  has there ever been a more "off , " out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?<br /><br />i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd ,  and agree that kubricks 2001 is a truly important film ,  given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid ,  stupid movie ,  and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fan-boys ,  who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them .  <br /><br />toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson ,  the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments ,  and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie . 
1715 1 greetings again from the darkness .  much anticipated ,  twisted comedy from writer/director richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor .  that bond guy is gone .  this new guy is something else entirely!! have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role ,  but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble ,  "facilitator"  .  .  .  and is anything but pretty! do not NOT_underestimate NOT_how NOT_twisted NOT_the NOT_humor NOT_is NOT_in NOT_this NOT_one .  if you go ,  expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex ,  killing ,  religion ,  sports ,  business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect .  brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements .  even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold . <br /><br />greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click .  hope davis has a small ,  but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear's wife (what's with her name "bean"?) who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room . <br /><br />the visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight ,  racetrack and denver suburb .  and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack? this one is definitely not NOT_for NOT_everyone ,  but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film-making ,  it could be for you . 
1716 0 i hate this movie! it was nothing like the book ,  and just thinking about it makes me mad .  if you watch the movie before reading the book ,  then yeah ,  it's a good movie .  but king's book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it .  i mean ,  the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different .  the ending for example! so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes .  but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze .  .  .  yeah ,  there is no NOT_maze NOT_in NOT_the NOT_book NOT_and NOT_there NOT_is NOT_no NOT_reason NOT_for NOT_it .  another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr .  halloran! what the heck ,  he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't NOT_important .  overall ,  it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off . 
1717 1 this film has a rotting core of flexible morality ,  and yet a quirky sense of justice .  so many of the regular joes among us would love to "stick it to the man" .  the "man" in this case is represented by several different characters .  mr .  keller ,  who carla reports to at her office .  later ,  paul owes 70 large to mr .  marchand the club owner .  and then there is paul's parole officer .  there seems to be so much question about this last character's side story .  reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonists ,  escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically .  they are beholden to each agent of the "man" .  one or both could be fired ,  killed ,  or imprisoned if they don't NOT_do NOT_as NOT_they NOT_are NOT_told . <br /><br />the film has a sense of relief at the end .  carla finally gets laid .  her boss is forced out for being a jerk .  mr .  club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom .  they get the $money$ .  and .  .  .  they need not NOT_worry NOT_about NOT_reporting NOT_in NOT_to NOT_the NOT_parole NOT_officer ,  because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him) .  it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight .  never NOT_mind NOT_that NOT_someone NOT_else NOT_may NOT_get NOT_paul's NOT_file NOT_later NOT_to NOT_supervise NOT_his NOT_release; NOT_for NOT_the NOT_moment NOT_they NOT_are NOT_free!

1718 0 i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel ,  and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released .  many reviewers out there aren't NOT_old NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_enormous NOT_hype NOT_that NOT_surrounded NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_and NOT_the NOT_struggle NOT_between NOT_stanley NOT_kubrick NOT_and NOT_steven NOT_king .  the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed "master" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen .  "salem's lot" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini-series ,  directed by tobe hooper (he of "texas chainsaw massacre" fame) and was badly handled ,  turning the major villain of the book into a "chiller theatre" vampire with no NOT_real NOT_menace NOT_at NOT_all NOT_thus NOT_destroying NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_premise .  fans hoped that a director of kubrick's stature would succeed where hooper had failed .  it didn't NOT_happen . <br /><br />sure ,  this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments ,  it's all downhill .  jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson .  he's always crazy and didn't NOT_bring NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_his NOT_role NOT_here .  i don't NOT_care NOT_that NOT_many NOT_reviewers NOT_here NOT_think NOT_he's NOT_all NOT_that NOT_in NOT_this NOT_clinker ,  the "here's johnny!" bit notwithstanding .  .  . he's just awful in this movie .  so is everyone else ,  for that matter .  scatman crothers' character ,  dick halloran ,  was essential to the plot of the book ,  yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest "shock" sequences ever put on film .  i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick ,  those that stayed that is .  .  . many left .  king's books really never NOT_translate NOT_well NOT_to NOT_film NOT_since NOT_so NOT_much NOT_of NOT_the NOT_narratives NOT_occur NOT_internally NOT_to NOT_his NOT_characters ,  and often metaphysically .  kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't NOT_really NOT_care NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_whom . <br /><br />this movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me . 
1719 1 it's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't NOT_be NOT_figured NOT_out NOT_at NOT_every NOT_turn .  surprises throughout delighting throughout . <br /><br />a couple of things i could not NOT_quite NOT_understand NOT_though NOT_is NOT_that NOT_here NOT_you NOT_have NOT_the NOT_lead NOT_female NOT_character NOT_who NOT_plays NOT_"the NOT_good NOT_girl ,  hard worker" and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker .  that was not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_me NOT_not NOT_like NOT_it NOT_though NOT_but NOT_it NOT_did NOT_give NOT_me NOT_pause . <br /><br />the other thing i could not NOT_get NOT_was NOT_the NOT_old NOT_man NOT_who NOT_was NOT_being NOT_hauled NOT_away NOT_by NOT_the NOT_police NOT_at NOT_the NOT_very NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film .  i never NOT_did NOT_get NOT_who NOT_he NOT_was NOT_or NOT_what NOT_his NOT_issues NOT_were .  if anyone has any ideas ,  i'd like to hear what they might be . <br /><br />the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing .  very much worth seeing . 
1720 0 kubrick meets king .  it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 ,  i remember .  then the movie came out ,  and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since . <br /><br />the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it .  the kubrick cultists don't NOT_give NOT_a NOT_damn NOT_about NOT_king's NOT_story .  they talk about steadicams ,  tracking shots ,  camera angles . this is a film ,  they insist: it should be considered on its own .  as it happens ,  both camps are correct .  unfortunately . <br /><br />if one views it purely as an adaptation of king's novel ,  "the shining" is indeed a failure ,  a wasted opportunity ,  a series of botched narrative gambits .  <br /><br />i used to blame that on kubrick's screenwriter .  the writer diane johnson (author of le marriage ,  l'affaire ,  le divorce ,  etc . ) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners .  maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics .  but the little blue-collar town of sidewinder ,  colorado doesn't NOT_exist NOT_on NOT_any NOT_map NOT_in NOT_her NOT_francophile NOT_universe .  <br /><br />kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial ,  however .  he ,  of course ,  is the real auteur .  and considered on its own merits ,  his screenplay for "the shining" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology ,  rationalism ,  supernaturalism ,  and implied reincarnation -- just doesn't NOT_stand NOT_up NOT_to NOT_logical NOT_analysis . <br /><br />i'm willing to consider kubrick's "shining" on its own terms .  i'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie .  but it doesn't NOT_succeed NOT_as NOT_a NOT_naturalistic NOT_study NOT_of NOT_isolation ,  alienation ,  and madness either .  parsed either way ,  the film pretty much falls apart . <br /><br />are the horrors of the overlook hotel real? or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance ,  then as the hallucinations of his father? one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a "ghost" he is in fact looking into a mirror .  one notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize jack's stunted ,  convoluted psyche .  very deep stuff . <br /><br />but if indeed the overlook's "ghosts" are purely manifestations of jack torrance's growing insanity ,  then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet ,  so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage?<br /><br />and can anyone explain ,  with a straight face ,  that black-and-white photograph (helpfully labelled "1921") of nicholson as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds? are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance's bad craziness stems from a some sort of "past life" experience? (and if you swallow that ,  since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)<br /><br />maybe kubrick didn't NOT_care NOT_about NOT_his NOT_storyline .  maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror .  whatever the case ,  the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways ,  rational and supernatural .  as a result ,  the story is a mess .  this movie hasn't improved with age ,  and it certainly doesn't NOT_improve NOT_with NOT_repeated NOT_viewings . <br /><br />i don't NOT_deny NOT_that NOT_a NOT_few NOT_moments NOT_of NOT_fear ,  claustrophobia ,  and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long ,  long film .  but those gushing elevators o' blood ,  seen repeatedly in little danny's visions ,  are absurd and laughable .  and jack torrance's infamous tag lines ("wendy ,  i'm home!" and "heeeeeere's johnny!") merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy .  (i know: i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: "whew! glad we don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_take NOT_this NOT_stuff NOT_seriously!") NOT_finally ,  kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son .  a foyer full of mummified guests ,  all sitting there dead in their party hats? yikes ,  now i really am afraid . <br /><br />given jack nicholson's brilliance over the years ,  one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling ,  eyebrow-wiggling ,  scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted .  the performance of shelley duvall ,  as a sort of female version of don knotts in "the ghost and mr .  chicken , " is best passed over in silence . <br /><br />this movie simply doesn't NOT_succeed NOT_-- NOT_not NOT_as NOT_an NOT_adaptation ,  not NOT_on NOT_its NOT_own NOT_terms .  it probably merits a 3 out of 10 ,  but i'm giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over-rated in this forum . 
1721 1 audiard made here a very interesting movie .  it begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman ,  in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored ,  frustrated ,  rejected .  .  .  hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail .  their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively .  characters'description is profund ,  goes into details .  .  . both start to help each other; for she can read on lips ,  which reveals itself to be very useful for him .  .  . she will progressively evolve ,  far from what she was at first . <br /><br />it's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing ,  even if it turns into a film noir at the end .  gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard's filming .  emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play .  action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs" .  it's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10 . 
1722 0 a disappointing film . <br /><br />the story established our protagonist as chrissy ,  a 'young' ,  rather sullen individual drifting ,  not NOT_doing NOT_much .  actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't NOT_surprise NOT_me NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_focus NOT_shifting NOT_on NOT_her NOT_relatives .  it's a pity though ,  chrissy seem like interesting character . <br /><br />story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated .  so the question now is ,  when are we going to see the campions ,  jacksons ,  and the tamahori's breaking ground with compelling ,  cinematically-told stories that will inspire ,  rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br /><br />technically ,  a disgusting shot film . 
1723 1 what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters? the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together .  it's simple and really efficient .  the background story is less important .  why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? it helps not NOT_to NOT_get NOT_stuck NOT_in NOT_those NOT_social NOT_demonstrations NOT_most NOT_french NOT_film-jerkers NOT_like NOT_to NOT_make .  not NOT_too NOT_much NOT_ambition ,  right: sur mes lã¨vres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization . <br /><br />for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy .  it goes quite as easy as in rear window (an obvious reference and definitely not NOT_a NOT_noir NOT_film) NOT_but NOT_with NOT_a NOT_less NOT_compelling NOT_context .  where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not NOT_been NOT_erased .  he brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if we've not NOT_missed NOT_a NOT_part NOT_before .  jacques audiard is not NOT_a NOT_new-comer NOT_yet .  strange and weird . 
1724 0 'succubus' ,  the edited version of 'necronomicon getrã¤umte sã¼nden' ,  is a struggle to sit through ,  even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma . <br /><br />jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics ,  since not NOT_one NOT_second NOT_of NOT_this NOT_mess NOT_made NOT_any NOT_sense NOT_whatsoever .  apparently ,  this is one of the better of his 180+ films â– it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there . <br /><br />the unfathomable plot deals with franco's usual themes of sex ,  violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s&m for good measure ,  and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious . <br /><br />i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again â– life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this . 
1725 1 carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids .  when she finds herself overloaded at work ,  she is able to hire paul to help her out .  paul is just out of jail ,  and his past is not NOT_entirely NOT_behind NOT_him .  to say too much more about the story ,  which has many twists ,  would be a mistake . <br /><br />the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't NOT_-- NOT_a NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_"point NOT_of NOT_hear" NOT_(like NOT_point NOT_of NOT_view) .  the early scenes that set this up ,  as well as the early character development of carla and paul ,  was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on ,  some of which were hard to follow and/or stretched credibility a bit .  there is also some unpleasant violence .  back to the positive side ,  the cinematography was very good . <br /><br />the film is worth seeing ,  but perhaps not NOT_seeking NOT_out .  seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4/28/2002 . 
1726 0 i've come to realise from watching euro horror ,  especially films made by cult luminary jess franco ,  that you can't NOT_expect NOT_a NOT_plot NOT_that NOT_makes NOT_much NOT_sense .  however ,  franco has gone overboard with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere ,  and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film .  i've got to admit that i saw the american cut version ,  which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut ,  i'm sure the longer european version is just as boring .  the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing s&m and talking rubbish ,  and it's all really boring .  there's no NOT_gore NOT_and NOT_the NOT_sex NOT_is NOT_dull ,  and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; i had difficulty making it all the way to the end .  i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there .  jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money ,  and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works . 
1727 1 i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute .  it is brilliantly shot ,  with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed .  the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike .  she hires an assistant at work ,  with her true intention being to find love .  he's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her .  in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off .  the film transcends into a dark film noir ,  with a couple of truly excellent scenes ,  and an even better finale .  the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability .  the use of sound keeps the tension consistent ,  and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping ,  that's for sure .  throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film .  it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make ,  but just can't . 
1728 0 even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from ,  this 'succubus' is often named as the best jess franco film .  heck ,  even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts 'succubus' among his personal favorites .  so ,  maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie .  the opening is great ,  though ,  and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage .  it's all downhill from here ,  unfortunately .  reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance .  franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations ,  beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score .  this could have been his greatest film indeed ,  if it wasn't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_lame NOT_and NOT_uninteresting NOT_story .  it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here .  half of the time ,  you don't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_clue NOT_what's NOT_going NOT_on NOT_or NOT_what NOT_exactly NOT_is NOT_said NOT_so NOT_even NOT_the NOT_short NOT_running NOT_time NOT_of NOT_80 NOT_minutes NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_last NOT_ages .  this most certainly isn't NOT_franco's NOT_best NOT_film NOT_according NOT_to NOT_me .  i wouldn't NOT_even NOT_recommend NOT_it NOT_to NOT_die-hard NOT_exploitation NOT_fans .  if you're looking for more superior jess franco film ,  try to get your hands on 'las vampiras' ,  'the awful dr .  orloff' or 'female vampire' . 
1729 1 surely one the french films of the decade so far ,  a taut ,  atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema .  emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning  ,  multi-faceted performance ,  at times devious and manipulative ,  at other times open and vulnerable .  another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france . 
1730 0 i had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what ,  in my opinion ,  is this shockingly bad film .  it fails on pretty much all levels; the cast is awful ,  the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth ,  leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines . <br /><br />plan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy . <br /><br />a bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie . 
1731 1 vincent cassel plays the part of paul ,  an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meets carla ,  a secretary who is â‘quite deaf' ,  when she has her hearing aids in â‘very deafâ‘ when not NOT_(played NOT_by NOT_emmanuelle NOT_devos) .  together they help each other to develop as people . <br /><br />what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters â– not NOT_fitting NOT_into NOT_obvious NOT_stereotypes .  paul appears uneasy in the office environment ,  is it that he's just not NOT_cut NOT_out NOT_for NOT_work? NOT_this NOT_belief NOT_is NOT_dispelled NOT_when NOT_he NOT_gets NOT_a NOT_job NOT_in NOT_a NOT_bar NOT_and NOT_shines . <br /><br />the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally ,  even if we think it is harmless or justified . <br /><br />finally ,  it is a film full of great â‘moments' both touching and humorous .  one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby .  she continues to cuddle it â– but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort . 
1732 0 "plan b" is strictly by-the-numbers fare except for one thing .  i surprisingly found it to be rather insulting . <br /><br />jon cryer is the "star" of this film and plays his usual ,  smarmy ,  egotistical ,  snotty character that was actually endearing in "pretty in pink" and has not NOT_been NOT_amusing NOT_ever NOT_since .  grating doesn't NOT_even NOT_begin NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_his NOT_performance .  ricky (mark matheisen) is a muscular ,  blonde ,  struggling actor who (gasp!) is only worried about his hair and getting laid .  talk about a stock character .  .  . ugh .  at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging .  lisa darr and lance guest play a grounded ,  optimistic ,  caring couple who are struggling to conceive .  since they are not NOT_whiny NOT_drama NOT_queens ,  however ,  their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren't NOT_given NOT_enough NOT_screen NOT_time .  sara mornell rounds out the cast by playing gina ,  your usual nice and good-looking young woman who just can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_find NOT_the NOT_right NOT_partner NOT_in NOT_love .  i've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation . <br /><br />what startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes .  they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked .  he was portrayed as being wild ,  ignorant and amazingly shallow .  they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays .  gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn't NOT_having NOT_any NOT_luck NOT_with NOT_guys .  honestly .  that wasn't NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_except NOT_they NOT_really NOT_went NOT_overboard NOT_when NOT_gina NOT_brought NOT_a NOT_lesbian NOT_to NOT_a NOT_christmas NOT_party NOT_her NOT_friends NOT_were NOT_throwing .  her lesbian date had very short hair (like i'm sure all lesbians do) .  she also got quite upset (like i'm sure all lesbians do) when gina had the nerve to put on lipstick(!) .  finally ,  her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment .  of course ,  we all know how gay people can't NOT_stay NOT_faithful NOT_for NOT_so NOT_much NOT_as NOT_a NOT_couple NOT_of NOT_hours NOT_much NOT_less NOT_months NOT_or NOT_even NOT_years ,  right? (please note the sarcasm in that statement .  thank you . )<br /><br />this film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but cryer's unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema .  2/10 
1733 1 put yourself into carla's shoes .  she is an overworked ,  unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible .  you know her: she's trained three of her last three bosses ,  knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth .  always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability ,  she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled .  what? you don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_hear NOT_it? NOT_well ,  she can't NOT_and NOT_neither NOT_can NOT_you NOT_until NOT_your NOT_hearing NOT_aid NOT_is NOT_in NOT_place .  prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired . <br /><br />carla (emmanuelle devos) needs a change in her life .  work is leading nowhere; friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed .  she won't NOT_take NOT_a NOT_vacation NOT_- NOT_a NOT_contract NOT_is NOT_going NOT_critical NOT_- NOT_so NOT_the NOT_only NOT_alternative NOT_is NOT_to NOT_hire NOT_an NOT_assistant .  carla submits requirements that convey her real needs: a 'well-groomed' man .  this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes .  <br /><br />paul (vincent cassell) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla's interest in his non-job-related qualities .  she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds ,  their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependence .  <br /><br />paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison: one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt .  his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office .  but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue . <br /><br />this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens .  carla grows more powerful ,  professionally as well as personally ,  as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us .  she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world . <br /><br />the two main characters are meant for each other ,  in a strange way .  without paul ,  carla will remain in her role of a doormat .  she has our sympathy ,  hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_best NOT_decisions NOT_along NOT_the NOT_way .  <br /><br />you will hear the world through carla's ears ,  from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid ,  muffled sounds ,  all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking .  with one major sense disabled ,  we see carla's heightened intuitive power to compensate .  and we can all use that sense to hear not NOT_only NOT_what NOT_people NOT_say ,  but also what they really mean . 
1734 0 i had quite high hopes for this film ,  even though it got a bad review in the paper .  i was extremely tolerant ,  and sat through the entire film .  i felt quite sick by the end . <br /><br />although i am not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_least NOT_prude NOT_or NOT_particularly NOT_sensitive NOT_to NOT_tasteless NOT_cinema--i NOT_thouroughly NOT_enjoyed NOT_both NOT_woody NOT_allen's NOT_'everything NOT_you NOT_ever NOT_wanted NOT_to NOT_know NOT_about NOT_sex ,  .  .  . ' and michael hanneke's 'funny games'--i found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening .  and when the film climaxed in an "orgy" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk ,  as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film ,  i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is . <br /><br />don't get me wrong ,  i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema ,  as well as independently made films ,  so this flick should have pleased me enormously .  avoid this film at all costs ,  it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema . 
1735 1 as in amelie ,  recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant ,  centered on a female finding her one true love .  in this case ,  desperation leads to a convict ,  which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype .  clever and surprising story in many ways ,  except that the female is there to support the male . <br /><br />for those of us that don't NOT_speak NOT_french ,  the subtitles are a little quick ,  but not NOT_unreasonable . <br /><br />the soundtrack ,  as seems to be increasingly the case with european films ,  is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations .  nothing seems forced .  visually ,  it reminds me of various urban horror movies .  there's a wes craven in chicago feel to it . 
1736 0 instead ,  go to the zoo ,  buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys .  monkeys are funny .  people with amnesia who don't NOT_say NOT_much ,  just sit there with vacant eyes are not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_funny . <br /><br />black comedy? there isn't NOT_a NOT_black NOT_person NOT_in NOT_it ,  and there isn't NOT_one NOT_funny NOT_thing NOT_in NOT_it NOT_either . <br /><br />walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack .  it's labeled unrated .  i think they took out the topless scene .  they may have taken out other stuff too ,  who knows? all we know is that whatever they took out ,  isn't NOT_there NOT_any NOT_more . <br /><br />the acting seemed ok to me .  there's a lot of unfathomables tho .  it's supposed to be a city? it's supposed to be a big lake? if it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves ,  why are they all wearing coats? 
1737 1 what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters .  this might require a bit of patience ,  especially since neither is "attractive" in the typical hollywood definition of such .  however ,  once the "heist" kicks in ,  the film rushes forward quickly ,  perhaps at times too quickly .  but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't NOT_look NOT_too NOT_closely NOT_it NOT_is NOT_all NOT_quite NOT_believable .  the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up . 
1738 0 where to start .  .  .  if this movie had been a dark comedy ,  i would say it was fannn-tastic! unfortunately for me ,  and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price i paid ,  got it from wal-mart) ,  this movie was meant to be a thriller .  the only thrill i got was watching kirkland's lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area .  if you want a good laugh ,  on a rainy friday night with some friends ,  then i highly recommend this movie .  but if you want to watch something at least half way decent ,  then don't NOT_even NOT_bother . <br /><br />i for one enjoy crappy films ,  the worse the better in most cases .  but wow .  .  .  i meant wow!! the only person in the entire film that didn't NOT_stink NOT_it NOT_up NOT_was NOT_the NOT_little NOT_boy ,  played by vincent berry .  the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do . 
1739 1 deaf secretary carla (emmanuelle devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues . <br /><br />when they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult ,  but ,  when the first applicant is ex-con paul (vincent cassel) she seizes the chance to change her life . <br /><br />carla covers his mistakes and he ,  anxious to go straight ,  reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues . <br /><br />when paul asks carla to return the favor ,  she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld ,  ruled by ruthless lone shark marchand (olivier gourmet) . <br /><br />recognizing her ability to lip-read as a weapon no NOT_one NOT_will NOT_have NOT_bargained NOT_for ,  the two set out to see justice done . <br /><br />french filmmaker jacques audiard's third feature "read my lips" is a genre-defying piece ,  switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller . 
1740 0 towards the end of this thriller ally sheedy's gaunt latter-day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image .  she convinces one that ,  if a nasty bette davis-type role were to come her way ,  she could carry it off brilliantly .  unfortunately ,  i can't NOT_find NOT_many NOT_other NOT_reasons NOT_for NOT_seeing NOT_this .  if you've wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) then here's your answer .  for the rest ,  sally kirkland's sex-starved crazy woman is really tiresome ,  and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes .  savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role .  of the leading actors ,  nicholas walker inspires no NOT_sympathy NOT_at NOT_all NOT_for NOT_paul NOT_keller's NOT_plight NOT_and NOT_his NOT_acting NOT_is NOT_wooden .  dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little .  sheedy's meticulous ,  understated performance (though she often seems to be on automatic pilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest .  the sets are drab ,  the camera-work undistinguished . 
1741 1 "read my lips (sur mes lã¨vres)" (which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title) is a nifty ,  twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope . <br /><br />the two leads are magnetic ,  emmanuelle devos (who i've never NOT_seen NOT_before NOT_despite NOT_her NOT_lengthy NOT_resume NOT_in NOT_french NOT_movies) NOT_and NOT_an NOT_even NOT_more NOT_disheveled NOT_than NOT_usual NOT_vincent NOT_cassel NOT_(who NOT_has NOT_brought NOT_a NOT_sexy NOT_and/or NOT_threatening NOT_look NOT_and NOT_voice NOT_to NOT_some NOT_us NOT_movies) . <br /><br />the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte .  the second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu . <br /><br />writer/director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrã©e for us into her perceptions ,  turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk) ,  using visuals as sensory reactors as well . <br /><br />none of the characters act as anticipated (she is not NOT_like NOT_that NOT_pliable NOT_victim NOT_from NOT_"in NOT_the NOT_company NOT_of NOT_men , " not NOT_in NOT_individual NOT_interactions ,  not NOT_in NOT_scenes ,  and not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_overall NOT_arc NOT_of NOT_the NOT_unpredictable NOT_story NOT_line NOT_(well ,  until the last shot ,  but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office ,  to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs .  <br /><br />there is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary ,  but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths . <br /><br />this is one of my favorites of the year! <br /><br />(originally written 7/28/2002)

1743 1 sur mes lã¨vres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders' ,  people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in' .  director jacques audiard with and co-writer tonino benacquista have created a tense ,  tight ,  completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights . <br /><br />carla (emmanuelle devos) is a plain jane ,  mostly deaf ,  thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak .  enter paul (vincent cassel) a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be carla's assistant .  there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting: carla had hoped for a well-groomed ,  genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse ,  unkempt sleazy guy who is not NOT_impressed NOT_with NOT_being NOT_a NOT_clerk .  their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and paul discovers carla's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed .  so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul's safety and freedom .  the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways . <br /><br />devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong .  once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense .  director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments .  this is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the french film noir genre .  recommended .  grady harp

1745 1 carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive ,  unappreciated and desperate .  she is also deaf . <br /><br />her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company .  help arrives in the form of paul ,  a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment . <br /><br />an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week .  when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back .  the colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery ,  but when he confronts her ,  paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price .  <br /><br />paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt .  he formulates a plan which utilises carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers .  it's now carla's turn to enter a frightening new world . <br /><br />the fourth feature from director jacques audiard ,  'read my lips' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners .  the leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect .  carla's first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was ,  until very recently ,  a jailbird .  emmanuelle devos ,  who plays carla ,  has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame .  vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed . <br /><br />like many french films ,  'read my lips' appears ,  at first ,  to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything .  the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac . <br /><br />it was the french 'new wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and i've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre ,  or better still ,  defy it . 
1746 0 an executive ,  very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life ,  meets a boy with down syndrome ,  escaped from a residence  .  both characters feel very alone ,  and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life .  .  .  with this argument ,  the somehow amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music ,  i didn't NOT_expect NOT_but NOT_a NOT_moralistic NOT_disgusting NOT_movie .  anyway ,  as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy) ,  and the interpretation of both actors ,  daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne ,  was very good ,  i decided to go on watching the movie .  the french cinema ,  in general ,  has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life ,  opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema .  but ,  because of that ,  it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending ,  with the impossible death of the boy ,  the charming tone ,  the happiness of the executive's family ,  the cheap moral ,  the unbearable laughter of the daughters ,  the guy waving from heaven as michael landon .  .  .  really nasty ,  in my humble opinion . 
1747 1 i watched this film not NOT_expecting NOT_much NOT_and NOT_not NOT_knowing NOT_anything NOT_much NOT_about NOT_it .  i loved it .  a very good ,  tight plot ,  an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly ,  fat ,  deaf girl and the ex-con ,  and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried .  <br /><br />a much ,  much better film than the same director's de battre mon coeur s'est arretã© ,  which was boring and unbelievable . <br /><br />the only thing that didn't NOT_quite NOT_work NOT_was NOT_that NOT_the NOT_supposedly NOT_ugly ,  fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid ,  certainly ,  and far from conventionally beautiful ,  but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it .  superb .  i wish she was in more films ,  and better ones than she generally is .  i've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache ,  and they both looked like rubbish ,  and i've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arretã© ,  and that certainly is rubbish .  she seems to have a few coming up ,  so i'll keep my fingers crossed .

1749 1 this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters .  i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours .  two lost ships from two different worlds collide .  the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact .  toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more: our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion .  rml could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty .  i'm nitpicking though .  after a series of netflix ,  blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making . 
1750 0 when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit ,  as the plot takes on quite complex issues .  using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach .  still unfortunately ,  despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture ,  adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays/lesbians ,  it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film .  this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle ,  attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with . <br /><br />however ,  this does not NOT_mean NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film NOT_is NOT_directly NOT_bad ,  as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing .  the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter ,  but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep .  this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts .  by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation . <br /><br />even if the film does at no NOT_point NOT_really NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_profound NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_drama ,  the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when "the ball drops" .  this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clichã© that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending .  nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending .  so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages ,  one can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_roll NOT_eyes NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_resolution .  personally i was close to shouting "finish already!!" at the screen . <br /><br />there were some decent acting in the film ,  and the two young female central characters had some good moments .  so did their parents and other bi-characters .  however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting ,  that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism .  he didn't NOT_even NOT_appear NOT_very NOT_likable ,  but rather self involved despite his good deeds ,  which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained . <br /><br />i give the film a 4 ,  as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from .  the script and cast had many good believable characters ,  giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others .  had the let-downs not NOT_been NOT_this NOT_disappointing ,  i'd easily give the film a 7 or 8 .  if you enjoyed this film ,  i'd recommend the film "east is east" ,  which i think is an as good ,  if not NOT_better NOT_rendering NOT_of NOT_cultural NOT_conflict ,  as well as being amusing and engaging . 
1751 1 well ,  what can i say having just watched this fantastic film ,  when my nerves are still jangling! jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france ,  and rightly so .  vince cassel is no NOT_tom NOT_cruise NOT_and NOT_emmanuelle NOT_devos NOT_is NOT_no NOT_penelope NOT_cruz NOT_either ,  but these two are fantastic actors ,  and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax .  others have written about the plot ,  so i will not NOT_say NOT_more NOT_than NOT_everyone NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_plays NOT_their NOT_role NOT_to NOT_perfection ,  the director ,  the actors ,  right down to the cameraman ,  and everything seems so real ,  no NOT_stupid NOT_gun NOT_play ,  the fighting when it happens is so credible ,  the expressions ,  the emotions ,  it is almost as you are there as a spectator .  do yourself a favour ,  get the dvd ,  a bottle of wine ,  turn the lights low ,  take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller :) 
1752 0 up until the last 20 minutes ,  i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work ,  which i am not NOT_familiar NOT_with) .  the final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed ,  one of the highlights of chan's career .  but to get to it ,  you have to sit through a lot of "comedy" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh ,  look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless "football" scenes .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_dubbing NOT_(which NOT_includes NOT_the NOT_line NOT_"how NOT_can NOT_i NOT_turn NOT_it NOT_off? NOT_it's NOT_not NOT_a NOT_tap" NOT_- NOT_watch NOT_to NOT_find NOT_out NOT_what NOT_it NOT_refers NOT_to) .  "dragon lord" is worth renting for the final fight alone ,  but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors ,  and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies .

1753 1 a super ,  unusual film from audiard ,  read my lips is a pulpy ,  lonely- hearts thriller .  it's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos .  devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean-pierre jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film) ,  versatile and capable of a subordinate profile . <br /><br />this is almost the definition of her role as carla ,  a put-upon office dogsbody ,  taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness .  yet she finds an ami d'exploitation ,  if you like in cassel's ex-con paul .  each exploits the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement .  devos/audiard manage carla's deafness and its attendant ,  warped inner world with discreet ,  stylish flair . <br /><br />in this film (2001) audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension ,  action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - a prophet - of nine years later .  7/10 
1754 0 i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic "private lessons" which portrays the dream of any male teenager . <br /><br />"private lessons ii" has nothing to do with the title i mention .  it's just a regular soft-core cinemax flick that won't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_change NOT_in NOT_your NOT_life .  there's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it .  i watched this a long time ago but believe me ,  this is just a regular boring soft core flick . <br /><br />the women are hot but that's not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_rent NOT_or NOT_buy NOT_the NOT_movie .  my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable . 
1755 1 jean-jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil .  this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument .  in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films: society is real ,  identity is a construction ,  freedom is criminal .  here the idea is treated literally .  both main characters find themselves ,  and each other ,  only when breaking rules .  this discovery may well hold true in france; at any rate ,  it's quite romantic . 
1756 0 i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people .  the one who wrote the brilliant "a double life" and the funny "born yesterday" and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as "adam's rib" and "pat and mike" with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome ,  sad drivel as "bachelor mother" ,  "some kind of a nut" ,  and this .  the cast tries ,  but the script is so tired and clichã©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated .  the script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen's character tests drivas's character to make sure he's not NOT_gay .  an ugly sequence ,  but sadly one which could easily play in a film today .  "ethnic" jokes are now totally verboten ,  but "fag" jokes are still "good ,  clean ,  family fun" . 
1757 1 interesting characters ,  lots of tension .  as close to black and white without being black and white .  i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character ,  a quiet ,  near deaf secretary ,  was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues ,  rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist ,  and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away .  i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks .  in this film we never NOT_know NOT_who's NOT_money NOT_it NOT_really NOT_is NOT_they NOT_abscond NOT_with ,  or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot .  too bad ,  the film could have been great . 
1758 0 casting bone to pick: david jannsen was 38 playing the father of robert drivas ,  who was then ,  31 (yeah ,  i realize he's supposed to be just out of college ,  but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he's probably 24-25 in the script--- that still puts jannsen in parenting classes in junior high) .  i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 year in medicine .  this movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city ,  circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking ,  the weird hair (drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well-groomed hip cousin it) and trendy fashions that went along with it .  if anyone remembers ,  lv wasn't NOT_exactly NOT_london .  .  .  the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days .  drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous; his dad thinks he might be gay (in a sad irony ,  drivas himself died of aids at 47) and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue (ahem ,  as if one may call 7 years a gap) .  sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino (caesar's palace!) ,  and plies him with girls (including the horny-for-money edy williams) .  interestingly enough ,  the son doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_mind NOT_being NOT_thought NOT_of NOT_as NOT_gay--- NOT_unusual NOT_for NOT_the NOT_time NOT_and NOT_a NOT_cute NOT_brenda NOT_vaccarro NOT_is NOT_nearby NOT_to NOT_swoon NOT_platonically NOT_over NOT_him .  what nudity there is is awfully lame--- just what was needed to pull the audience in for an 'r' rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system (which then was g-m-r[16]- and x) .  the editing is horrible and there's stupid-silly overdubs by the committee (a late 60's neo-avante-garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years) .  don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer .  .  .  seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later .  not NOT_to NOT_give NOT_anything NOT_away ,  but they would've dealt with mr .  rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then .  a curiosity at best ,  far from joshua logan's usual caliber of work .  dos/dias .  now go watch casino again .  .  . 
1759 1 after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times ,  there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama ,  "read my lips" .  having written over five hundred reviews ,  i have never NOT_found NOT_myself NOT_at NOT_such NOT_a NOT_loss NOT_of NOT_words NOT_as NOT_i NOT_did NOT_with NOT_director NOT_jacques NOT_audiard's NOT_subtle ,  yet inspirational love story .  thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film ,  and while the "loves" overpowered ,  it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind .  "read my lips" is a drama .  to be more precise ,  is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work .  here is where this review begins to crumble ,  it is all of these items â– but it is moreâ…much ,  much more .  as a viewer ,  you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla ,  whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty .  audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not NOT_wearing NOT_her NOT_aid ,  causing an immediate unrest ,  not NOT_only NOT_from NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_within NOT_the NOT_film ,  but to those watching .  without sound ,  the world is left open to any possibility ,  and that is frightening . <br /><br />as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life ,  we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul (played exquisitely by vincent cassel) ,  a slicked-back hair ,  mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison ,  homeless ,  jobless ,  and forced by his parole officer to get a job .  this is how carla and paul meet .  there is that moment of instant ,  unsettling attraction .  the one where we think she loves him ,  but he is dark (and here is where it gets even more fun) â– and where we think he loves her ,  but she is dark .  the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown .  who ,  as viewers ,  are we to feel the most sympathy for? paul sleeps in the office ,  carla helps him; carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker ,  paul helps her; carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for paul .  the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair ,  waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave .  it never NOT_does .  audiard cannot just allow this story to take place ,  he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next .  even our rock ,  our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing â– a subplot to this film that at first angered me ,  but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film .  yet none of this could have happened if it weren't NOT_for NOT_our NOT_characters .  devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking ,  as she changes her image for paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered .  paul ,  the wildcard in the film ,  continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame .  then ,  just as we assume one ,  carla takes on one last shape . <br /><br />audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters .  cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair .  the story ,  probably the weakest part of this film ,  is at first random .  the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first ,  but audiard lets them connect bit by bit .  again ,  the entire parole officer segment was tangent ,  but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means .  not NOT_attempting NOT_to NOT_sound NOT_vague ,  but this complex (yet utterly simple) story is difficult to explain .  there is plenty happening ,  but it is up to you to connect the pieces .  a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held .  that use of sound and scene was brilliant .  it was tense ,  it was dramatic ,  and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes . <br /><br />overall ,  i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over â– i was proved wrong .  "read my lips" opens the floor for discussion ,  not NOT_just NOT_with NOT_the NOT_characters ,  but the situations .  one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene ,  and paul in the next .  when a discovery is made in paul's apartment by carla ,  i found myself deeply angry .  audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development ,  and what he was lacking in plot â– the actors were able to carry .  i can easily suggest this film to anyone ,  but be prepared; this isn't NOT_a NOT_one NOT_time NOT_viewing NOT_film .  repeat .  repeat .  repeat . <br /><br />grade: **** out of ***** 
1760 0 garson kanin wrote and directed this look at "modern day" las vegas and the gap between generations ,  his first directorial effort since the 1940s! david janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (robert drivas ,  who looks disconcertingly like an older jason bateman) .  janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively ,  with a chip on his shoulder .  playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from janssen ,  who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out don rickles and makes him cry!) .  his son ,  a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity ,  makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas (give them another ten years) ,  and his disapproval of dad's lifestyle causes friction .  brenda vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and edy willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition .  unfortunately ,  "where it's at" doesn't NOT_have NOT_much NOT_else NOT_going NOT_for NOT_it NOT_other NOT_than NOT_the NOT_now-dated NOT_ruminations NOT_on NOT_ethics NOT_between NOT_adults NOT_and NOT_their NOT_kids ,  some quick t&a shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now ,  ad nauseum .  ** from **** 
1761 1 probably the best film of the year for me .  this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla (emmanuelle devos) who spends her days doing other men's jobs ,  uncredited ,  and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as ,  being partially deaf ,  she reads lips .  a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul (vincent cassel) as her assistant .  the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film .  mutual dependency ,  for vastly different reasons ,  bonds them .  carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for , what seems like , the first time .  paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help .  he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas' skill of reading lips .  i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars .  throughout the whole film ,  no NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_other NOT_characters NOT_are NOT_on NOT_screen ,  you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul .  i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors .  emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the french cesar for best actress) .  you never NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_you NOT_are NOT_watching NOT_a NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_acting ,  this really is carla .  the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful .  he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive .  i loved this film because of these two people ,  and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again . 
1762 0 thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called german independent series ,  four for venice is not NOT_only NOT_awful ,  but really awful .  so awful ,  that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash . <br /><br />nick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession .  eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth ,  where eva works as a waitress and luis ,  an artist .  nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress .  luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick .  luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork ,  but the fact is ,  he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday .  eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to venice for confrontation .  the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one another . <br /><br />the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy .  it not NOT_only NOT_look NOT_senseless ,  but also draggy .  in the film ,  nick try to seek help for several ways ,  but it ends to no NOT_avail .  it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons ,  or they are just simply dumb . <br /><br />the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story .  while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense ,  no NOT_one NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_are NOT_using NOT_common NOT_sense NOT_to NOT_solve NOT_the NOT_problem .  they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem . <br /><br />it fails so bad ,  that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film . 
1763 1 "read my lips" tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain ,  socially maladroit female office worker (devos) and her workplace trainee ,  a crude excon (casel) .  as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds ,  each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome .  good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents .  in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation .  (b+) 
1764 0 there is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy ,  nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches ,  and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie .  judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not NOT_well NOT_done .  but it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it . 
1765 1 i picked this one up on a whim from the library ,  and was very pleasantly surprised .  lots of tight ,  expressionistic camera work ,  an equally tight script ,  and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film .  not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_reptilian NOT_multiplex NOT_brain ,  but rather the true aficionado of cinema .  if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it ,  i'm sure it will ruin it .  a choice treat all the way around .  other posters here have more than amply sung its praises ,  so i needn't bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice ,  and mine ,  and don't NOT_miss NOT_this NOT_gem .  call it what you like; i call it two hours of entertainment well-spent .  read my lips: don't NOT_miss NOT_it . 
1766 0 the problems with this film are many ,  but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones .  first of all ,  while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life ,  the reality was that everything ,  as usual in movies and tv ,  was about something bizarre ,  usually of a sexual nature .  the story lines were thin or nonexistent ,  and virtually every scene ,  camera shot ,  line of dialog ,  and expressed emotion was absolutely ,  and totally fake .  it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out (something no NOT_uncommon NOT_for NOT_me NOT_in NOT_recent NOT_years . ) i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program ,  but i believe the (at one time ,  pre-amelia ,  talented)director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty ,  so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool . 
1767 1 i settled back to watch "read my lips , " a plate of freedom fries before me .  the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and co-writer jacques audiard's original and superb thriller . <br /><br />carla (emmanuelle devos) is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects .  she actually has some significant responsibilities that don't NOT_often NOT_fall NOT_to NOT_secretaries NOT_and NOT_she's NOT_capable NOT_and NOT_ambitious .  and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not NOT_reward NOT_her . <br /><br />work piling up faster than she can handle it ,  carla is told to hire a secretary .  enter ex-con and general layabout paul (vincent cassel) .  he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require .  after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla's interest in him ,  the two become allies .  a quirky friendship starts .  in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on "the apprentice , " she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul's connivance .  exit the rival . <br /><br />carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid .  with it she hears almost normally .  she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people .  she's also very lonely .  a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she's truly beautiful .  she hasn't a boyfriend .  she babysits so a friend can have a liaison (it is a french movie) worse and humiliatingly ,  she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla's bed .  not NOT_nice . <br /><br />as carla and paul get to know each other better ,  the barely repressed larcenous side of the not NOT_so NOT_former NOT_felon NOT_emerges .  there's a side story ,  by the way ,  of paul's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending . <br /><br />"read my lips?" ingenious paul recognizes that carla's ability to read lips ,  even from a considerable distance ,  is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be . <br /><br />from there a caper develops .  enough said . <br /><br />paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple .  she wants love but will also accept money .  he wants her ,  sort of ,  but business must come before possible erotic satiation .  together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly . <br /><br />rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you'll go for "read my lips . " and you may well want to watch it several times: i do . <br /><br />9/10 
1768 0 new york ,  i love you ,  or rather should-be-titled manhattan ,  i love looking at your people in sometimes love ,  is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation .  case in point ,  look at two of the segments in the film ,  one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk ,  and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books .  while the latter isn't NOT_a NOT_great NOT_story NOT_by NOT_any NOT_stretch ,  it's at least something that has a beginning ,  middle and end ,  as the composer tries to score ,  gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap ,  and in the end gets some help (and maybe something more) from a girl he's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director .  the ethan hawke scene ,  however ,  is like nothing ,  and feels like it ,  like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in (or ,  for that matter ,  hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites) . <br /><br />what's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible 'stories' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another (i . e .  bits involving bradley cooper ,  drea dematteo ,  hayden christensen ,  andy garcia ,  james caan ,  natalie portman ,  etc) .  it's not NOT_even NOT_so NOT_much NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film- NOT_set NOT_practically NOT_always NOT_in NOT_*manhattan* NOT_and NOT_not NOT_the NOT_new NOT_york NOT_of NOT_queens NOT_or NOT_staten NOT_island NOT_or NOT_the NOT_bronx NOT_(not NOT_even ,  say ,  harlem or washington heights)- lacks a good deal of diversity ,  since there is some .  it's the lack of imagination that one found in spades ,  for better or worse ,  in paris j'taime .  it's mostly got little to do with new york ,  except for passing references ,  and at its worst (the julie christie/shia labeouf segment) it's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling . <br /><br />so ,  basically ,  wait for tv ,  and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in ,  that is ,  for three scenes: the aforementioned bloom/christina ricci segment which is charming; the brett ratner directed segment (yes ,  x-men 3 brett ratner) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary .  everything else can be missed ,  even natalie portman's directorial debut ,  and the return of a hughes brother (only one ,  allan) to the screen .  a mixed bag is putting it lightly: it's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left . 
1769 1 if you're a fan of film noir and think they don't NOT_make NOT_'em NOT_like NOT_they NOT_used NOT_to ,  here is your answer -they just don't NOT_make NOT_'em NOT_in NOT_hollywood NOT_anymore .  we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying ,  subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be .  read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard ,  featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent cassel . <br /><br />the basic plot could have been written in the 40's: dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing ,  manipulate each other to meet their own ends ,  develop complex love/hate relationship ,  cook up criminal scheme involving heist ,  double crosses ,  close calls and lots of money .  all action takes place in depressing ,  seedy and/or poorly lit locations .  <br /><br />audiard has fashioned some modern twists ,  of course .  the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her .  and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature .  add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film ,  but make no NOT_mistake NOT_- NOT_this NOT_is NOT_old NOT_school NOT_film NOT_noir .  it's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i've seen all year . 
1770 0 an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised .  there's a lot of talent involved here .  a great many talented actors ,  directors and writers .  unfortunately ,  i couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had . <br /><br />first of all ,  the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality .  and unfortunately some of them clash with the others .  <br /><br />secondly ,  several segments feel underdeveloped to me .  like seeds of good stories that never NOT_come NOT_to NOT_fruition .  i'm not NOT_talking NOT_about NOT_happy NOT_endings NOT_here NOT_(or NOT_even NOT_an NOT_ending NOT_period) NOT_but NOT_rather ,  they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in .  <br /><br />last but not NOT_least ,  i did not NOT_feel NOT_new-york NOT_and NOT_its NOT_inhabitants NOT_were NOT_properly NOT_portrayed . <br /><br />what you're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied . 
1771 1 i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it .  the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie .  i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself ,  but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time .  in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some (cheap) thrillers ,  but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie .  normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their income .  but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman .  that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did . <br /><br />"sur mes lã¨vres" or "read my lips" as it is called in english ,  tells the story of a young secretary named carla .  she is a hardworking and loyal employee ,  but has never NOT_been NOT_very NOT_appreciated NOT_by NOT_her NOT_colleagues .  that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency ,  which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company .  but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her ,  all this is about to change .  paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict .  the man is a thief ,  but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed .  she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like ,  but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life .  .  . <br /><br />since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - i will not NOT_make NOT_any NOT_comparisons NOT_between NOT_hitchcock NOT_and NOT_jacques NOT_audiard's NOT_directing .  fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie .  i hadn't heard of him before ,  but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end .  that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course .  i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role ,  instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband (you know ,  the typical tv-movie story) . <br /><br />also worth noticing is the acting in this movie .  vincent cassel is quite famous ,  but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me .  there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles ,  but they both did an excellent job with their characters ,  making them feel very believable and realistic .  paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman ,  but thanks to their performances ,  you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together . <br /><br />all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting .  despite the fact that i had my doubts about it ,  i've soon become one of its greatest admirers .  i give this movie an 8/10 .  don't NOT_hesitate NOT_to NOT_give NOT_it NOT_a NOT_try . 
1772 0 a few years back the same persons who created paris , j'taime .  ,  which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7) ,  created this piece of garbage about new york city . <br /><br />in paris ,  i love you (j'taime)created a feeling for paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful paris . <br /><br />in this current film ,  i did not NOT_recognize NOT_new NOT_york NOT_city ,  i did not NOT_feel NOT_that NOT_i NOT_was NOT_in NOT_the NOT_city NOT_of NOT_my NOT_birth . <br /><br />new york does have 5 boroughs , i saw no NOT_scenes NOT_in NOT_the NOT_bronx ,  or queens  , there is one scene in brooklyn , (brighton beach) ,  i saw no NOT_scenes NOT_in NOT_times NOT_square NOT_or NOT_greenwich NOT_village/ NOT_no NOT_scenes NOT_of NOT_the NOT_beautiful NOT_hotels NOT_or NOT_theatres .  it does have a large cast , most of the performers were not NOT_even NOT_stereotypes ,  they were caricatures of the lowest sort . <br /><br />the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know & love .  .  <br /><br />a few of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were far better . <br /><br />ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) imdb 1 (out of 10)<br /><br />in my way of thinking i think the title should have been<br /><br />new york ,  i hate you . 
1773 1 this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called "frenchfilm" to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year .  so far ,  as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema . <br /><br />what a breath of fresh air to the stale ,  predictable ,  unimaginative ,  crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood .  what a good example for screenplay writers ,  actors ,  directors and cinematographers to follow .  it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures .  <br /><br />the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end .  is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naã¯ve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display? will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other . <br /><br />once you have seen this film ,  like me you may want to see it again .  i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look .  the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office .  you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place .  but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied .  four stars out of five for me . 
1774 0 following the success of "paris ,  je t'aime" ,  a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york .  unlike the original film ,  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story ,  it's over in too many cases .  and ,  the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together .  as a result ,  there is no NOT_title NOT_to NOT_indicate NOT_that NOT_a NOT_story NOT_is NOT_complete NOT_and NOT_it NOT_is NOT_less NOT_formal NOT_in NOT_structure . <br /><br />sadly ,  however ,  while "paris ,  je t'aime" was hit or miss (mostly hit) ,  most of "new york ,  i love you" was miss .  the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet--and often quite terrible .  it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories--and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so .  now understand ,  it was good quality music but its somber tone really ,  really made me feel like cutting my wrists! among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom ,  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also in the first film) and the crotchety old couple .  this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much--and i really wanted to love this film .  i respected what they tried but simply didn't NOT_like NOT_it NOT_very NOT_much . <br /><br />by the way ,  and this is not NOT_really NOT_a NOT_complaint ,  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film .  for a recent film ,  that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture . <br /><br />also ,  if you get the dvd ,  there are two segments included as extras that were not NOT_included NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film .  one consists of kevin bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog .  .  .  . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes .  the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world--including a very unhappy couple . 
1775 1 french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary ,  everyday suburban life .  this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps ( time out )  ,  a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job .  as is the penchant of french filmmakers  ,  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places ,  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  ,  yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a swiss mountain retreat ) .  running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production ,  jacques audiard's gritty crime caper ,  sur mes levres ( read my lips ) .  actually ,  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that .  as with the earlier french release ,  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them .  in a paris construction firm carla ,  a shy ,  diminutive young woman sits at her desk ,  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms . <br /><br />obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla's desk to chat and drop off their half-finished styrofoam cups of coffee .  partially deaf ,  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome ,  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby .  when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load ,  carla fears she may lose her job .  at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant (preferably male) as if she were at a personals agency .  he should be 25 years old and clean -cut  ,  with extensive computer and filing skills .  when the agency sends over an unkempt  ,  menacing looking young man ,  carla is both shocked and intrigued .  they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery ,  where carla interviews her prospective assistant .  when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  ,  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul ,  but has a change of heart and hires him on .  although she is basically kind toward her helper ,  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power .  paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker .  carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment .  during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips .  later ,  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on ,  a furious carla asks paul's help in seeking revenge on the man .  from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years .  the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock ,  most notably rear window ,  where carla's lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars .  there is a teasing ,  on-again ,  off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest ,  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars .  that being said ,  what one carries away from this movie isn't NOT_so NOT_much NOT_the NOT_similarities NOT_to NOT_classic NOT_hitchcock NOT_thrillers ,  although those elements are definitely there ,  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city (in this case paris) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy ,  garish nightlife where sex ,  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters .  unlike hollywood productions ,  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street ,  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared .  it's hitchcock with the gloves off .

1777 1 one of the better kung fu movies ,  but not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_flawless NOT_as NOT_i NOT_had NOT_hoped NOT_given NOT_the NOT_glowing NOT_reviews .  the movie starts out well enough ,  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you'd think for this era) and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable (for a kung fu movie ,  this is a great compliment) .  unlike other chinese action movies ,  which were always period pieces or (in the wake of jackie chan's police story i) cop dramas ,  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china .  unfortunately ,  in the latter 1/3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary . <br /><br />the action is overall good ,  featuring a duel between sammo and 1/2 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars ,  kar-leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy .  there's only 20 minutes of combat here ,  which is standard ,  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames .  i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other ,  but there are smooth edits and then there's this .  it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with . <br /><br />that said ,  if you like kung fu movies ,  my opinion here won't NOT_dissuade NOT_you ,  and if you don't ,  you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this .

1779 1 this is one of the best hong kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes .  this sammo film has it all ,  romance ,  drama ,  excitement and a great hero as well .  it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights .  sammo fans- this is a must see (see also eastern condors ,  shanghai express (yuen biao is ace!) ,  dragons forever and enter the fat dragon . 
1780 0 i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was .  <br /><br />first off ,  the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots .  there are no NOT_black NOT_or NOT_gay NOT_new NOT_yorkers NOT_in NOT_love? NOT_or NOT_who ,  say ,  know the self-involved white people in love? i know it's not NOT_the NOT_love NOT_crash NOT_of NOT_anvil-tastic NOT_inclusiveness NOT_but NOT_you NOT_can't NOT_pretend NOT_to NOT_have NOT_a NOT_cinematic NOT_new NOT_york NOT_with NOT_out NOT_these NOT_fairly NOT_prevalent NOT_members NOT_of NOT_society .  plus ,  you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham-handed oscar ,  so where is everyone? <br /><br />possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs? me either) .  this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst .  bad acting ,  bad writing ,  bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants .  <br /><br />but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion .  and ,  side note ,  uma dodged a bullet; ethan hawke looks ravaged .  this ,  of course ,  is one thing in terms of his looks ,  but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor ,  lovely maggie q . <br /><br />i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire ,  but it has to be the anton yelchin/ olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste ,  which saddens me because i really like those two actors .  i don't NOT_consider NOT_myself NOT_easily NOT_offended ,  but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt .  <br /><br />a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeouf's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie .  i don't NOT_mean NOT_opposite ,  i mean against .  against is the only explanation .  i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight .  highlight .  please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits ,  which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world .  this film is embarrassing ,  strangely dated ,  inarticulate ,  ineffective ,  pretentious and ,  in the end ,  completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all .  <br /><br />(the extra star is for the cloris leachman/ eli wallach sequence ,  as it is actually quite sweet ,  but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless ,  masturbatory torment . ) 
1781 1 this is one excellent sammo hung movie .  actually ,  this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema .  the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp .  the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined .  the story is involving and has enough romance ,  drama ,  comedy ,  and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes .  sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business .  the action is simply amazing ,  esp .  the fight w/ lau kar leung and the finale .  billy chow and sammo hung are amazing .  a must see for any fan of action . 
1782 0 having loved 'paris ,  je t'aime' ,  i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations ,  but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons . <br /><br />although ,  i was not NOT_expecting NOT_a NOT_re-make NOT_of NOT_'paris' NOT_in NOT_new NOT_york NOT_i NOT_was NOT_expecting NOT_the NOT_same NOT_structure .  what i liked about 'paris' was the breakup of the neighborhoods .  you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell .  in 'ny' ,  there is no NOT_clear NOT_separation NOT_of NOT_the NOT_stories ,  at different points in the film ,  characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on .  also ,  the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no NOT_flow . <br /><br />another thing i loved about the 'paris' film was the different takes on love .  it wasn't NOT_all NOT_romantic .  there was love between parents and their children ,  unrequited love ,  a lonely ,  middle-aged woman yearning for love etc .  ,  it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans .  'ny' seemed to only go for an edgy ,  over-the-top sexuality .  there were some redeemable shorts (the older couple having spent a lifetime together ,  julie christie's short) ,  but overall the'ny' film didn't NOT_evoke NOT_any NOT_emotion NOT_for NOT_me .  i didn't NOT_connect NOT_with NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_like NOT_i NOT_did NOT_with NOT_'paris' .  i remember watching 'paris' and feeling a deep sadness ,  loneliness ,  yearning ,  hopefulness ,  wonder .  .  .  it just had so much soul .  for me ,  there was no NOT_soul NOT_in NOT_the NOT_'ny' NOT_film . <br /><br />maybe if i had gone into it without having 'paris' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response ,  but as a self-titled re-take of 'paris ,  je t'aime' i was sorely disappointed . 
1783 1 what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said .  this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed!! there are moments of genius throughout this movie ,  if you can ,  see it now! thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago! 
1784 0 (i'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin . ) my dissatisfaction is split: 30% tone-deafness ,  70% lackluster writing . <br /><br />the 30%: i agree with the first commenter's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories .  i was surprised how ,  this film ,  at best ,  woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it's inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl (this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl) .  a few minority characters are written into the stories ,  but they are included by obligation ,  while we can see the gears under the film so clearly ,  striving to "be diverse" but falling ever-so-short . <br /><br />the 70% is why everything falls short .  all characters ,  white plus a few token minorities ,  are one-dimensional ,  cardboard cutouts of people concepts .  worse ,  their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i'd say is a "gag": we get a basic conceit ,  then some punchline intended to be a clever twist .  but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say ,  "okay ,  that was a surprise" .  .  . the stories are still not NOT_that NOT_interesting ,  because they ,  too ,  are shallow .  when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending ,  you're writing jokes . <br /><br />spoilers below .  .  . <br /><br />the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories .  that's fine .  but romance is amazing ,  deep ,  sometimes complex .  these "romantic" stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other .  words exchange ,  thoughts are projected through voice-over ,  but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another . <br /><br />meaning ,  there is no NOT_seduction NOT_(in NOT_the NOT_broad NOT_sense) ,  no NOT_tension ,  and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other .  the only story involving a superficial "seduction" is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy (ethan hawke) gets outwitted by the girl he's hitting on ,  who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker .  sure ,  his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we'd be if we were next to them ,  but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of "a then b" .  so it unfolds ,  if something like a postcard could "unfold" ,  with all the other tales as well: a then b--that's it ,  the only point being that these happen to occur "on set" in manhattan .  by the way ,  the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch; the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village . <br /><br />it's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race ,  gender ,  sexual orientation ,  and so on .  _new york ,  i love you_ ,  however ,  deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title .  we expect to see the real new york ,  and real new yorkers ,  but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic ,  its characters flown in from the o . c .  ,  plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity .  but when we look closer at who those characters are ,  the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent . <br /><br />for example ,  the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park ,  who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny (male nanny) when in fact he's the father .  notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic-construction point of view (it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend/stepfather are strutting the girl away) ,  it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl's father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer .  what ,  the dad can't NOT_be NOT_just NOT_some NOT_guy NOT_from NOT_south NOT_america? NOT_now NOT_that NOT_he's NOT_obviously NOT_hot ,  is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle-to-upper-class white woman? are we that naive as to require such? as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable . <br /><br />it's not NOT_my NOT_place NOT_to NOT_dictate NOT_where NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_should NOT_have NOT_gone .  but in every conceivable set-up and plot twist ,  the direction taken screams status quo ,  appeals to safety .  all these stories could have been made more interesting ,  even if we were forced to keep the single-dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them ,  at the very least by not NOT_choosing NOT_from NOT_standard NOT_and NOT_obvious NOT_stereotypes .  asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy? how 'bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead .  again ,  i'm not NOT_saying NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_conceit NOT_has NOT_to NOT_be NOT_changed .  it's just that every .  damn .  story premise .  is so hackneyed--and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york ,  outside the trite .  the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading . <br /><br />i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack ,  the good pacing of the movie (even if what was being paced was ,  well ,  dredge) ,  and the general feel of many of the scenes .  the movie was just fine to sit through ,  and i wouldn't NOT_dissuade NOT_anyone NOT_from NOT_doing NOT_so .  however ,  it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrased) "that's what i love about new york: everyone's from a different place . " well ,  you wouldn't NOT_know NOT_it NOT_from NOT_watching NOT_this NOT_one . 
1785 1 sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything .  great story ,  great fights ,  great characters and great cameos . <br /><br />this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat .  sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino ,  sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in . <br /><br />some great and touching moments in the film ,  lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted . <br /><br />the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button ,  as its one of the best end fights i've seen .  sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow .

1787 1 sammo hung's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece .  i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has .  it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama ,  interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters ,  some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_hong NOT_kong NOT_cinema NOT_watches NOT_the NOT_film NOT_as NOT_well NOT_as NOT_it NOT_does NOT_to NOT_the NOT_experienced NOT_enthusiasts NOT_of NOT_the NOT_unique NOT_industry . <br /><br />sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century ,  i think .  they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love .  sammo is interested in local baker girl ping (nina li chi) while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit-ying he falls madly in love with .  many other characters get introduced ,  too ,  and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong! soon we get to know ,  for instance ,  that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists ,  too ,  and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created .  as well as some nice drama . <br /><br />the film has a great cast .  the leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and "humor" as in sammo's otherwise great eastern condors (1987) ,  for example) and they are also ,  thanks to the carefully written screenplay ,  pretty likable and easy to identify with .  the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2 ,  ninja in the dragon's den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2) ,  the masterful composer lowell lo koon-ting (john woo's the killer and ringo lam's school on fire and prison on fire among many others ,  pedicab driver included!) ,  the shaw veteran liu chia liang (whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks) ,  alfred cheung kin-ting (the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988) ,  the late great lam ching ying (best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror/kung fu/comedies) to name just a few .  in fact ,  the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production . <br /><br />the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo's character .  they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love ,  no NOT_matter NOT_what's NOT_your NOT_past NOT_or NOT_what NOT_you've NOT_done NOT_for NOT_living ,  get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner .  also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship ,  and of course love .  still i think what fennie says to max (about the future "bad cooking") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively ,  unfortunately . <br /><br />but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in .  which is the action ,  the outrageous and over-the-top action .  the fight scenes include traditional kung fu ,  some sticks ,  meat cleavers and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever ,  jackie chan's drunken master ii (1994) ,  they really are that great! there are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched .  simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver .  also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs .  pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination .  still the film makers seem not NOT_to NOT_"accept" NOT_the NOT_violence NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film NOT_as NOT_sammo NOT_is ,  like the late bruce lee ,  willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa ,  and i think this kind of morale ,  no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_obvious NOT_or NOT_shallow NOT_it NOT_may NOT_be ,  is a good thing even in a harmless film like this ,  as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment . <br /><br />the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not NOT_sure NOT_everyone NOT_in NOT_hollywood NOT_or NOT_america NOT_(for NOT_example) NOT_would NOT_understand NOT_or NOT_like NOT_at NOT_all .  the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing .  also some funny scenes are created out of sammo's passion for ping .  still ,  the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this ,  and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction ,  of course . <br /><br />pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo's greatest achievements .  if the few minor flaws were not NOT_there ,  this could rate even brighter and higher .  8/10 
1788 0 just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival .  just before going i came here to see how it was rated ,  and at that time it was 7 . 4 ,  a pretty nice rate .  .  . <br /><br />after 15 minutes i was dying to get out (never did this) ,  but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening . <br /><br />i did not NOT_like NOT_at NOT_all ,  the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere ,  the characters are shallower than the dialogs ,  nothing lead anywhere ,  and the worst and worst: plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie .  despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself ,  i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! all of this would be bearable if the plot ,  characters ,  romances ,  anything was good ,  but was bad ,  really bad! a "don't know how to do" sex-in-the-city . <br /><br />don't waste your time or money . 
1789 1 this ,  "prodigal son" and "eastern condors" are my favourite sammo hung films .  the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "condors" ,  but he's no NOT_less NOT_sure-footed NOT_as NOT_director NOT_or NOT_actor .  he is ,  in fact ,  at the top of his form and delivers a devastating ,  brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate ,  sweet love story also .  love and romance are not NOT_the NOT_director's NOT_priorities NOT_here ,  but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action ,  and insure that viewers don't NOT_hit NOT_the NOT_fast-forward NOT_button NOT_between NOT_the NOT_physical NOT_clashes . <br /><br />the opening scene ,  which features a funny light sabre duel ,  sets a solid but deceptive tone .  a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp ,  comic tone .  the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp ,  superb direction ,  and easily one of the best ever of its type .  the film's violence escalates slowly until ,  finally ,  when the climactic showdown comes ,  we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production .  the director/actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry ,  menacing opponents is a bone-cracking ,  physically punishing delight . <br /><br />terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made . <br /><br />great score ,  too . 
1790 0 but "cinderella" gets my vote ,  not NOT_only NOT_for NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_of NOT_disney's NOT_princess NOT_movies ,  but for the worst movie the company made during walt's lifetime .  the music is genuinely pretty ,  and the story deserves to be called "classic . " what fails in this movie are the characters ,  particularly the title character ,  who could only be called "the heroine" in the loosest sense of the term . <br /><br />after a brief prologue ,  the audience is introduced to cinderella .  she is waking up in the morning and singing "a dream is a wish your heart makes . " this establishes her as an idealist (and thus deserving of our sympathy) .  unfortunately ,  the script gives us no NOT_clue NOT_as NOT_to NOT_what NOT_she NOT_is NOT_dreaming NOT_about .  freedom from her servant role? the respect of her step-family? someone to talk to besides mice and birds? in one song (cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd) cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently .  you go girlfriend! in short ,  cinderella is a very bland character .  she passively accepts her step-family's abuse ,  escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief .  she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family .  for this ,  she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear ,  a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except ,  of course ,  cinderella .  can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat? if cinderella is dull ,  her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless .  the prince in cinderella gets no NOT_dialog NOT_and NOT_almost NOT_no NOT_screen NOT_time .  we are given no NOT_indication NOT_if NOT_he NOT_is NOT_a NOT_good NOT_man ,  if he respects cinderella or anything .  all we know is 1) he is a prince and 2) he dances well .  heck ,  even the prince from "snow white" got to sing a romantic song at least .  not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_this NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_development NOT_make NOT_the NOT_romance NOT_less NOT_interesting ,  it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot ,  weakening her already tenuous appeal . <br /><br />perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were ,  the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie's comic relief ,  cinderella's friends ,  the mice .  granted ,  these characters are amusing .  even so ,  when the comic relief steals the show from the principals ,  well ,  let's just say your story has some problems . <br /><br />dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as "masterpieces . " while many of them are ,  there are some that do not NOT_deserve NOT_this NOT_appellate NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way .  cinderella is a prime example of this fact . 
1791 1 i have seen this movie .  this movie is the best according today's need .  dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays .  in stating this problem this movie is the best .  in this movie ,  the indian values are stated very well .  today's youth must understand this problem .  there is less population of girls .  and due to this problem of dowry  ,  the girls committed suicide .  if this problem continues ,  then the day when there is no NOT_girl NOT_child ,  is not NOT_far NOT_away . so ,  keep in mind this statement  , today's youth must understand that we can not NOT_take NOT_dowry NOT_in NOT_marriages . we have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not NOT_be NOT_taken . and if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society .  this is the major change in the society . 
1792 0 this film is awful .  not NOT_offensive NOT_but NOT_extremely NOT_predictable .  the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's .  the father ,  the principal at the school ,  is going through a mid-life crisis .  enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff ,  like think for yourself .  the principal doesn't NOT_agree NOT_with NOT_her NOT_teaching NOT_but NOT_she NOT_is NOT_pretty .  you can connect the dots .  his teenage daughter (winona ryder wannabe tara frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live .  she gets some bad advice ,  hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't NOT_being NOT_taught NOT_at NOT_her NOT_school .  shocking! seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv ,  this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms . 
1793 1 once in a while ,  you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained .  vivah is just that â– maybe more .  after watching ddlj ,  saajan ,  and lamhey ,  i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never NOT_come NOT_up NOT_with NOT_anything NOT_like NOT_that NOT_- NOT_ever .  boy was i wrong! i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new "don" (just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh â– although the decision is already made in my mind) .  after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do .  when i saw the rating of u instead of an a ,  i was happy that at least it is something where i don't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_scantily NOT_clad NOT_women NOT_with NOT_bad NOT_acting NOT_skills NOT_doing NOT_nothing NOT_but NOT_dancing NOT_on NOT_every NOT_opportunity NOT_they NOT_get NOT_and NOT_making NOT_out NOT_with NOT_every NOT_guy NOT_to NOT_show NOT_that NOT_they NOT_have NOT_more NOT_skills NOT_in NOT_bed NOT_than NOT_a NOT_hollywood NOT_b NOT_actress .  for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting .  after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never NOT_gained NOT_his NOT_fame NOT_as NOT_an NOT_accomplished NOT_actor .  boy â– was i wrong about this movie .  this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never NOT_let NOT_it NOT_go .  it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society .  i liked not NOT_only NOT_that NOT_the NOT_director NOT_was NOT_brave NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_where NOT_younger NOT_generation NOT_might NOT_not NOT_relate NOT_to NOT_the NOT_concept NOT_(of NOT_arranged NOT_marriage) ,  but also that he did it with a conviction (that it is the right thing to do) .  i have no NOT_idea NOT_why NOT_some NOT_people NOT_think NOT_that NOT_the NOT_acting NOT_was NOT_not NOT_good .  i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not NOT_be NOT_considered NOT_the NOT_best NOT_ever ,  it was still very very good .  the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time .  the other good thing is that thee songs are not NOT_pushed NOT_into NOT_the NOT_script NOT_as NOT_we NOT_have NOT_all NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_so NOT_many NOT_movies .  these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition .  just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor (after company) ,  and salman found his groove after "hum aapkey hain kaun"; this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood .  this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role .  he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid .  yes you will not NOT_find NOT_him NOT_playing NOT_basketball NOT_and NOT_scoring NOT_every NOT_point NOT_on NOT_a NOT_dunk NOT_like NOT_you NOT_saw NOT_shahrukh NOT_in NOT_ddlj NOT_(even NOT_though NOT_he NOT_is NOT_shown NOT_to NOT_be NOT_an NOT_indian NOT_in NOT_england NOT_â– NOT_both NOT_countries NOT_not NOT_big NOT_on NOT_basketball NOT_by NOT_the NOT_way) ,  he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values .  amrita rao ,  for the first time came across as someone to be remembered .  in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her .  no NOT_one NOT_knew NOT_how NOT_good NOT_of NOT_an NOT_actress NOT_she NOT_really NOT_is NOT_until NOT_they NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie .  some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting .  although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one .  i think this movie will and should do wonders for her .  move over rani â– there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you .  she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence .  oh having almost 0% body fat does not NOT_hurt NOT_either NOT_(yes NOT_people NOT_i NOT_will NOT_challenge NOT_you NOT_find NOT_even NOT_0 . 1% fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too) .  i thought i will never NOT_be NOT_enamored NOT_by NOT_anyone's NOT_beauty NOT_after NOT_madhuri NOT_and NOT_early NOT_kajol ,  but she completely changed that .  shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job (although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered "hum aapkey hain kaun") .  when i finished watching this movie ,  it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again (right away) .  yes right away .  i have never NOT_ever NOT_done NOT_that .  not NOT_even NOT_with NOT_ddlj ,  but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again .  i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with .  i miss those times where families sat down and had fun .  when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in .  i know a lot of people think that movie does not NOT_portray NOT_real NOT_life NOT_but NOT_deep NOT_down NOT_don't NOT_we NOT_all NOT_want NOT_it NOT_to NOT_happen .  the families ,  thee tradition ,  the love and respect .  this is what this movie will remind all of us of .  i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy .  i am sure some young people will not NOT_like NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_if NOT_you NOT_are NOT_over NOT_28 NOT_i NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_you NOT_will NOT_be NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them . 
1794 0 two years before he wrote and directed "arthur" ,  steve gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for henry winkler ,  then tv's "the fonz" .  a 1950s college thespian (and all-around jerk) woos a co-ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet ,  he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling ,  eventually becoming a "gorgeous george"-like celebrity .  turning likable winkler into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego) ,  but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and mean ,  staged rather sloppily by director carl reiner .  particularly crude is a wincing bit involving hervã© villechaize (of "fantasy island") putting the moves on polly holliday (flo from "alice") .  as henry's beloved ,  kim darby looks a little out of her element--particularly when surrounded by all these tv hams--rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential .  *1/2 from **** 
1795 1 what can i say ,  i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain ,  hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya .  soraj have always been different .  movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find .  love and joint family that loving and great .  vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage .  shahid has done fine work .  anupamji as always brilliant .  amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesn't NOT_suit NOT_in NOT_that NOT_role .  we've seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras ,  and main ho on na .  so quit different role that she isn't NOT_in NOT_to .  she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could've put little more in the role .  anyways great going work by barjatya .  this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot .  sweet film of the year .  great music and lyrics .  i am not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_its NOT_a NOT_remake NOT_but NOT_anyways NOT_brilliant NOT_story NOT_that NOT_is NOT_original .  soraj's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him .  great work by all the cast the crew and everybody .  lovely family film to enjoy with your parents ,  siblings ,  friends and love ones .  i give it 10 out of 10 . 
1796 0 eddie murphy's "delirious" is completely and totally rude ,  crude ,  crass and lude .  this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling ,  trashy piece of stand-up .  eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over .  he does manage to be funny occasionally ,  but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes . <br /><br />forget it! unless you happen to enjoy eddie's foul style .  i don't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_will NOT_bother NOT_with NOT_"eddie NOT_murphy NOT_raw" .  i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script . <br /><br />saturday ,  january 17 ,  1998 - video 
1797 1 one would have to be very jaded indeed not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_swept NOT_up NOT_into NOT_this NOT_gem NOT_of NOT_a NOT_film NOT_(and NOT_i've NOT_seen NOT_hundreds NOT_of NOT_hindi NOT_and NOT_bollywood NOT_movies ,  too) .  the actors ,  the beautiful settings ,  locations ,  and surroundings ,  the deep emotions portrayed ,  the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of udit narayan ,  my favorite) -- everything was just lovely .  the human (imperfect) element was also woven in ,  to create some drama and drive the plot ,  as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution .  alok nath is such a terrific actor ,  so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays ,  he almost steals the show from the young stars .  i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances -- ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love -- as one of the best films out there ,  hindi or otherwise! 
1798 0 on the 1998 summer blockbuster hit baseketball (1998): "this is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk .  unfortunately ,  i was sober when i saw this movie . "<br /><br />so quoted the late gene siskel for this lame-brained ,  supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior "there's something about mary" in a one-upmanship game during july of 1998 .  "mary" was a gross-out fest ,  but in addition to the many gags ,  it had a lot of heart ,  which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer . <br /><br />"baseketball" tried to outdo mary ,  but it fizzled in more ways that one .  you take the creators of "south park , " trey parker and matt stone ,  who are fortunately not NOT_behind NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_the NOT_camera ,  the only member of zaz david zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck ,  and the other two jim abrahams and jerry zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture ,  a small bit by now 90 years young ernest borgnine ,  wasting his precious time in his distinguished career ,  dying on a hotdog and singing "i'm too sexy" as he videotapes his will ,  jenny mccarthy ,  who has little screen time as borgnine's not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter ,  a bigger female part by yasmine bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters ,  and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey ,  robert vaughn as a corrupt archrival ,  and pointless cameos by "airplane!" alumni kareem abdul jabaar and the late robert stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the zaz family .  what do all these people make up? a desperate cast and crew trying to replicate "airplane!" humor and mixing it up with the crudity of "south park , " but failing in every way . <br /><br />to make this long 100-minute movie short ,  "baseketball , " a real game invented by david zucker and his friends in his hometown of milwaukee ,  is about two lazy losers (parker and stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of one's house .  after borgnine dies ,  he bequeaths the ownership of his baseketball team ,  the milwaukee beers to parker and stone .  sure enough ,  the game goes national ,  and archrivals vaughn and mccarthy want to take away ownership of the beers team from them .  but bleeth is in love with both men ,  particularly parker ,  and one poor ,  sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them .  those are the characters ,  not NOT_strongly NOT_developed . <br /><br />now witless gags ensue .  blood ,  electroshock hair ,  egg-throwing and screaming are among them .  parker and stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital ,  but he pulls through the liver transplant .  borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will .  mccarthy ,  who seemed to get over borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away ,  quickly massages vaughn in the next scene .  cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits .  there is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing .  and david zucker forces the parodies of "riverdance" and "titanic . " parody forcing is nothing new to zaz ,  post "airplane!" and "the naked gun" series . <br /><br />and like siskel ,  i was sober as well ,  but i was also getting sleepy .  this movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers ,  but will they remain alert and awake ,  or pass out during the unfunny parts? if they pass out ,  then they won't NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_they NOT_are NOT_luckily NOT_missing NOT_stupidity NOT_and NOT_absurdity .  hats off to them! 
1799 1 i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine .  since my younger brother has recently got married ,  we could connect with the goings-on .  the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple .  thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used ,  which have been already visited by most of the urbanites ,  hence adding to the connection with movie .  the dialogues are much better than those in the "umrao jaan ada" - a supposedly dialogue based movie .  the background music is augmenting the "soft focus" of the movie .  it somehow remind me of vv chopra's "kareeb" ,  in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character .  same here ,  in that the lead pair does not NOT_disappoint NOT_in NOT_any NOT_department-looks NOT_or NOT_acting .  the supporting cast are too good .  i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league .  the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters .  songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie .  however ,  though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana ,  i missed ram laxman badly . <br /><br />it had no NOT_double NOT_entendres(sivan NOT_category) ,  no NOT_bikinis ,  no NOT_intrigue ,  and no NOT_nonsense .  you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged .  i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not NOT_only NOT_individuals ,  his approach is totally individualistic .  the movie is only about prem & poonam ,  rest of the characters are incidental .  art immitating life? the "peripheral characters" are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair .  <br /><br />coming back ,  everything was almost great .  except ,  for the drama part .  the situation of tragedy was artificially created .  the outcome ,  the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not NOT_compelling NOT_at NOT_all .  that is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events .  but ,  a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film' .  but i kept waiting for the punch and it never NOT_came .  the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard .  may be this will help the movie a tax-free status .  but the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was . <br /><br />there were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 has the movie really ended? 2 has the movie ended? 
1800 0  .  .  . and not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_good NOT_way .  baseketball is a waste of film in all most every single way .  it is offensive to all the senses .  this doesn't NOT_necessarily NOT_bother NOT_me ,  i've seen plenty of bad movies ,  really bad movies before and will see them again .  baseketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it .  the reason baseketball offends me is that it stars trey parker and matt stone in a film they didn't NOT_write .  any respect i had for david zucker has long since depleted .  his recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes .  "airplane" was a revolutionary and very funny comedy ,  watching baseketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person . <br /><br />i have so much respect for trey parker and matt stone .  these men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today .  their pictures and south park episodes are as relevant as they are funny .  every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them .  it's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity .  i imagine baseketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons .  it is a stupid mess with no NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_dignity NOT_or NOT_class .  parker and stone have essentially whored themselves out .  the film plays like a 90 minute episode of family guy . <br /><br />parker and stone have never NOT_been NOT_great NOT_actors .  they've been serviceable in their films .  i can't NOT_really NOT_find NOT_a NOT_way NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_their NOT_performance NOT_in NOT_baseketball ,  other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film .  every line is delivered in such a silly winking way .  it's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way .  i am reminded of the south park episode "how to eat with your butt" where cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no NOT_plot NOT_or NOT_plausibility NOT_except NOT_to NOT_gross NOT_out ,  parker and stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture .  really it's sad . <br /><br />and yet that is not NOT_my NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_baseketball .  my biggest gripe with the picture is that i sit there knowing that parker and stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script .  i know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable .  there isn't NOT_any NOT_indication NOT_that NOT_zucker NOT_let NOT_them NOT_improv NOT_scenes NOT_either .  parker and stone are merely tools to a bad director .  baseketball has some funny concepts and i think parker especially if he were allowed to take zuckers script could have elaborated on them more .  instead we get potty humor .  don't NOT_rent NOT_baseketball NOT_you NOT_can NOT_get NOT_the NOT_same NOT_laughs NOT_watching NOT_a NOT_group NOT_of NOT_grade NOT_schoolers NOT_joking NOT_around 
1801 1 this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now .  family and friends feel the same way about it .  this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time .  in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive .  shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this ,  also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies .  this is a must see movie ,  it's a family and romantic movie .  this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon .  this movie is their best right now .  .  .  the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction .  this movie is must see .  .  .  recommended to everyone!! 
1802 0 sophia loren plays aida ,  in one of the worst films of all time .  she can't NOT_lipsync .  in terms of production values ,  the film is so bad ,  that at one point ,  while loren is mouthing "o patria mia , " she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support ,  and the canvas set billows and shakes . 
1803 1 well .  .  .  vivah is quite a good ,  but typical sooraj barjatya's movie .  it shows different aspects of indian families ,  wedding ceremonies ,  etc .  the movie is more than good ,  but not NOT_extremely NOT_good . <br /><br />the big plus point of the movie is direction ,  music and shahid and amrita's acting (especially the last scene) .  the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie--- a girl being disliked by her step-mother .  story is the movie is a bit common ,  but it is good ,  good enough to make the movie a blockbuster . <br /><br />minus point is common story of bollywood movie .  overall i would say it is two times must watch movie ,  if you want to see typical indian family values and of-course love! 
1804 0 i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film .  she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953 . <br /><br />i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia loren's early work .  i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess .  surely ,  today ,  this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making .  it actually became annoying watching ms .  loren in skin color paint throughout the film . <br /><br />yes ,  this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie .  then ,  the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent .  i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight . <br /><br />as beautiful as ms .  loren was at age 19 and still is today ,  the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage .  after all ,  we don't NOT_see NOT_beautiful NOT_young NOT_people NOT_on NOT_stage NOT_with NOT_"old NOT_opera NOT_singers" NOT_back NOT_stage NOT_singing NOT_from NOT_behind NOT_the NOT_curtain! NOT_do NOT_not NOT_discount NOT_the NOT_success NOT_of NOT_using NOT_heavy-weight NOT_opera NOT_singers .  one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j .  g .  wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product .  this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to date . <br /><br />the quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality .  the color ink has faded much and that can not NOT_be NOT_helped . <br /><br />to improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we ,  who do not NOT_speak NOT_italian ,  can know what the lyrics are saying .  it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes . <br /><br />watch this film not NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story NOT_of NOT_aida NOT_nor NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_this NOT_is NOT_an NOT_opera .  aside from ms .  sofia loren none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer .  instead ,  watch this movie if you are a fan of ms .  loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_the NOT_production NOT_is . <br /><br />larry from illinois 
1805 1 i thought this movie was really really great because ,  in india cinemas nowadays ,  all you see is skin ,  music ,  and bad acting .  .  . in this movie ,  you can see some tradition ,  ethnicity ,  and at least some decency .  .  . although some parts were a little dramatic ,  guess what? that is what indian cinema is all about! after watching this movie ,  at least you don't NOT_get NOT_a NOT_headache NOT_from NOT_all NOT_the NOT_loud NOT_overrated NOT_music ,  or any violence ,  its just the truth ,  it teaches about love ,  and of course caring for the person you love throughout life .  .  . i think it was an amazing movie .  .  . kids can watch it without a doubt ,  and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india's sure profoundness .  .  . until all these rap hits ,  miniskirts ,  and skin showing became a part of it . 
1806 0 1937's "stella dallas" with barbara stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well--how anyone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler .  perhaps they thought jaunty ,  cheerfully brash bette midler could make something out of it ,  but this hoary script defeats her .  plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock ,  and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life ,  can't NOT_escape NOT_tatty ,  old-fashioned trappings and sentiment .  midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses ,  but that fails to happen here; stephen collins is stolid as the man who changes her life ,  but trini alvarado is well-cast as midler's daughter .  this is what used to be referred to as a "woman's picture" ,  a wallow ,  but it doesn't NOT_pass NOT_muster NOT_because NOT_it NOT_stays NOT_too NOT_faithful NOT_to NOT_its NOT_1930's NOT_origins .  *1/2 from **** 
1807 1 i can honestly say i never NOT_expected NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_be NOT_good .  i do not NOT_like NOT_family NOT_films .  i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor .  the director's last movie (mpkdh was complete stupidity .  and the music was very boring and bland .  but there was amrita rao ,  who has become my favorite after main hoon na .  there was also seema biswas ,  alok nath ,  and anupam kher who are very talented .  so a few plus points . <br /><br />i finally saw the movie and i was very impressed .  he brings us the young lovers of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding ,  and we have a winner .  the story outline is similar to hahk ,  light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end .  the director also made character that you could relate to .  the thing i did not NOT_like NOT_about NOT_hahk NOT_was NOT_that NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_were NOT_too NOT_eccentric .  the casting adds to its perfection .  shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance .  this is a major improvement ,  and most importantly he suits the role .  the best is easily amrita rao .  in fact ,  this is her best performance .  her screen presence is so electrifying ,  you are bound to love her performance .  sameer soni ,  amrutha prakash ,  anupam kher ,  alok nath and seema biswas are terrifically cast .  not NOT_one NOT_actor NOT_feels NOT_out NOT_of NOT_place .  <br /><br />the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them .  mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballads .  milan abhi aada adhura hai is also nice in watching .  the songs aren't NOT_colorful NOT_and NOT_dancey ,  and they are more like ballads .  the exception is hamari shaadi mein which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk .  so what was the flaw in the movie? the movie gets quite slow ,  and the ending is quite stretched .  but the movie is still goes at a good pace ,  making it a perfect family film . 
1808 0 "stella" ,  starring bette midler in the title role ,  is an unabashed tearjerker .  set in upstate new york ,  stella claire works nights as a bar maid ,  pouring and dancing in a workingman's saloon .  one night ,  in comes a slumming medical intern ,  stephen dallas ,  who woos stella ,  and in the course of their affair impregnates her .  she spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion ,  sends him packing to a lucrative medical career ,  and raises her daughter herself in near-poverty .  flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous ,  loving ,  young lady .  dr .  dallas is not NOT_out NOT_of NOT_the NOT_picture ,  still maintaining a tenuous ,  but caring relationship with his daughter andâ… .  . i'm rambling ,  and worse yet ,  making the movie sound somewhat interesting .  the acting and screenwriting are so over-the-top you'll let out a groan in almost every scene .  the chief offender is bette midler ,  but close behind is john goodman as her alcoholic buddy .  each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale ,  which is truly a hoot .  taken as a dramatic piece ,  this film rates no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_grade NOT_d ,  but as camp ,  it scores an unintended b+ . <br /><br /> 
1809 1 suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage .  and here he is; back to his basics on vivaah .  as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage .  a movie you can watch with your entire family around you .  a movie you will hate watching alone .  the story is simple ,  but the music is good ,  cinematography is excellent ,  direction is best ,  everything about the movie has a class of its own .  there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart ,  you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie . <br /><br />shahid & amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq ,  & shikhar .  though shikhar was a good movie it wasn't NOT_accepted NOT_well NOT_by NOT_the NOT_public . a truly shahid & amrita film . 
1810 0 an unmarried woman named stella (bette midler) gets pregnant by a wealthy man (stephen collins) .  he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own .  things go ok until the child named jenny (trini alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse . <br /><br />i've seen both the silent version and sound version of "stella dallas" .  neither one affected me much (and i cry easily) but they were well-made if dated .  trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea .  i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "beaches" to get this made .  this (predictably) bombed .  the story is laughable and dated by today's standards .  even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end .  stephen collins and marsha mason (both good actors) don't NOT_help NOT_in NOT_supporting NOT_roles .  flimsy and dull .  really--who thought this would work? see the 1937 stanwyck version instead .  i give this a 1 . 
1811 1 i had lost faith in sooraj r .  barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon ,  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good .  but i didn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_my NOT_hard NOT_earned NOT_money NOT_watching NOT_it NOT_in NOT_cinema .  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj .  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie .  sooraj r .  barjatyagot it right this time ,  okay i was not NOT_a NOT_huge NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_hum NOT_app NOT_ke NOT_hai NOT_kaun .  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya ,  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work .  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying .  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie ,  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it ,  my view a much underrated movie . <br /><br />the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times ,  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition .  it's done in present times ,  lots of people don't NOT_believe NOT_in NOT_this NOT_arrange NOT_marriage ,  but i do .  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly .  when prem meets poonam for the first time ,  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen .  it was a very sweet ,  you feel nervous yet excited ,  the song "do ajnabe" shows that very well .  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam (shahid kapoor and amrita rao) and there families .  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good ,  the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box . <br /><br />what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam ,  how they fall for each other is too sweet .  simple boy and simple girl ,  when they first meet during and after the song "do anjane ajnabe" it's very sweet to watch ,  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking .  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other .  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have .  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness ,  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem .  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl .  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie ,  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness .  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too ,  he is poonam support in the film ,  he is her happiness the movie ,  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never NOT_seen NOT_a NOT_cuter NOT_couple NOT_since NOT_srk NOT_and NOT_kajol .  if ishq vishk didn't NOT_touch NOT_you NOT_to NOT_telling NOT_you NOT_how NOT_cute NOT_they NOT_are NOT_together NOT_this NOT_surely NOT_will .  "mujhe haq hai" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show .  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet .  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to .  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever . <br /><br />the direction is spot on ,  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them .  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie .  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop! the music is amazing ,  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for?<br /><br />what i can finally say it ,  rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good ,  this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person .  its basically the sweetest journey ever ,  its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifeâ…well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing! 
1812 0 yes ,  this movie make me feel real horror ,  when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it .  the bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho - junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen  .  believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie ,  i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not NOT_have NOT_that NOT_money NOT_but NOT_that NOT_is NOT_no NOT_justification NOT_for NOT_a NOT_stupid NOT_plot NOT_and NOT_bad NOT_acting .  i'm always supporting independent movies ,  when it deserves the support ,  but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies .  i'm still traumatized .  i will not NOT_trust NOT_in NOT_any NOT_nice NOT_cover NOT_anymore . 
1813 1 vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006 ! period !! .  in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood .  its sad that this movie doesn't NOT_have NOT_that NOT_many NOT_reviews NOT_and NOT_isn't NOT_having NOT_that NOT_much NOT_popularity .  <br /><br />vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again .  after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah .  <br /><br />this is the most simple and cute movies that i've seen this year .  after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter ,  i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture . <br /><br />i don't NOT_know NOT_why NOT_bollywood NOT_is NOT_moving NOT_away NOT_from NOT_the NOT_beautiful NOT_culture NOT_which NOT_we NOT_have NOT_and NOT_are NOT_making NOT_hollywood NOT_remake NOT_style NOT_crap NOT_movies NOT_like NOT_dhoom NOT_2 NOT_and NOT_don .  <br /><br />the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of .  our system which teaches us to obey elders ,  follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie! .  of course there isn't NOT_any NOT_force NOT_in NOT_choosing NOT_your NOT_life NOT_partner NOT_and NOT_it NOT_should NOT_be NOT_a NOT_brief NOT_meeting NOT_between NOT_the NOT_couple NOT_and NOT_its NOT_up NOT_to NOT_them NOT_to NOT_decide NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is NOT_brilliantly NOT_shown NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie .  <br /><br />coming back to the movie .  .  .  .  . vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage .  the phase where the guy meets the girl ! .  .  .  . both understand each other  .  . both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the various which occur during marriages . <br /><br />amrita rao is brilliant in the movie .  .  .  .  .  .  . shahid is ok .  .  .  .  . and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome !! the songs are brilliant .  ! i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi  .  .  .  .  .  . <br /><br />overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do ! . <br /><br />go see this movie .  .  .  .  .  . i just have to say one word .  .  .  .  .  .  . <br /><br />bliss ! . 
1814 0 i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely disapointed . <br /><br />i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then .  being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself (ie no NOT_budget ,  shot on digi cam) ,  i stand by my original comments .  this is a no NOT_budget NOT_student NOT_project NOT_(and NOT_not NOT_a NOT_particularly NOT_good NOT_one) ,  released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover) .  so deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not .  i want my money back under the trades description act! complete rubbish! 
1815 1 this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones . its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around . shahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well .  .  . the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values .  .  . the movies doesn't NOT_get NOT_10 NOT_as NOT_it NOT_isn't NOT_very NOT_good NOT_at NOT_music NOT_which NOT_counts NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_in NOT_every NOT_movie , besides this it is flawless .  .  .  . 
1816 0 after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover ,  i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good .  nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features .  .  . but when i played the movie itself ,  what a let down .  it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time .  the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film .  so don't NOT_believe NOT_it NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_like NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_cash! 
1817 1 i can't NOT_believe NOT_currently NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_rated NOT_a NOT_6 . 9 .  anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen .  it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema .  as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao .  he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy ,  while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_get NOT_as NOT_much NOT_attention NOT_as NOT_she NOT_does NOT_so NOT_her NOT_aunt NOT_dislikes NOT_amrita NOT_with NOT_a NOT_passion .  this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her .  it was also very touching to see that although amrita's family wasn't NOT_that NOT_rich NOT_maybe NOT_just NOT_middle NOT_class NOT_to NOT_lower NOT_class ,  while shahids family was quite upper class ,  they still treated their family with respect and didn't NOT_even NOT_ask NOT_put NOT_them NOT_down NOT_which NOT_really NOT_struck NOT_a NOT_nerve NOT_with NOT_me .  this is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not NOT_as NOT_well NOT_of NOT_thinking NOT_their NOT_below NOT_their NOT_standards NOT_which NOT_i NOT_feel NOT_is NOT_very NOT_shallow .  this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't NOT_a NOT_rich NOT_business NOT_tycoons NOT_daughter NOT_or NOT_anything .  all in all this movie deserved an 8/10 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made . 
1818 0 dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film .  the way it is shot ,  lit ,  acted etc .  just doesn't NOT_make NOT_sense .  it's all so bad it is difficult to watch .  loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom .  there seems to be no NOT_'normal' NOT_person NOT_in NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_film NOT_and NOT_the NOT_existence NOT_of NOT_the NOT_'outside NOT_world' NOT_is ,  well ,  it just doesn't NOT_exist .  and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden? this film is beyond stupidity .  zero . 
1819 1 i liked this movies .  its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen ,  all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice .  .  .  another rule of yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent .  think back to all of those films .  .  mpk suman didn't NOT_have NOT_mom ,  hmapk salman didn't NOT_have NOT_parents ,  and final rule is that you are 90% likely to see alock nath crying .  .  . <br /><br />the film is good too .  its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained .  there is almost no NOT_comedy NOT_but NOT_it NOT_does NOT_make NOT_you NOT_smile NOT_often NOT_enough .  the little kid (hero's nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners .  the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't NOT_get NOT_that NOT_in NOT_real NOT_life .  this film doesn't NOT_have NOT_massively NOT_big NOT_happy NOT_families NOT_living NOT_in NOT_big NOT_house NOT_which NOT_i NOT_thou NOT_was NOT_a NOT_good NOT_idea NOT_and NOT_allowed NOT_the NOT_film NOT_to NOT_be NOT_differentiated NOT_from NOT_other NOT_films .  there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film .  there isn't NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_message NOT_from NOT_this NOT_film NOT_but NOT_its NOT_a NOT_good NOT_watch .  if you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through .  and if you are not NOT_it NOT_will NOT_inform NOT_and NOT_may NOT_be NOT_scare NOT_you NOT_ .  .  . <br /><br />overall a very good looking film .  no NOT_big NOT_plots NOT_or NOT_twists NOT_but NOT_a NOT_very NOT_gentle NOT_film ,  very much like bollywood classic . 
1820 0 the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring .  some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor . <br /><br />there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script .  lena endre was good looking as always . <br /><br />i don't NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_original NOT_movie NOT_so NOT_i NOT_can't NOT_say NOT_if NOT_it's NOT_better NOT_or NOT_worse . <br /><br />if you enjoy movies like sã¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at . 
1821 1 it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best at . a story woven around a marriage . it feels nice to have a movie in which there is no NOT_single NOT_scene NOT_which NOT_you NOT_would NOT_avoid NOT_watching NOT_with NOT_your NOT_family .  though the story is simple and does not NOT_contain NOT_any NOT_new NOT_elements , you still like the movie , because of the presentation ,  performances , and actually the over all treatment .  hats off to suraj .  .  the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love .  the depiction of the changes in the way of thinking , behaving once you get engaged is excellent .  director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection . though the movie is slow , you don't NOT_mind NOT_it , because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple .  as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears(specially ladies) .  but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-) . 
1822 0 this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made .  <br /><br />it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006 . <br /><br />i've never NOT_seen NOT_so NOT_many NOT_visible NOT_sponsored NOT_products NOT_in NOT_one NOT_and NOT_the NOT_same NOT_movie .  it shouldn't be that obvious .  <br /><br />i can't NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_so NOT_many NOT_known NOT_actors NOT_even NOT_thought NOT_the NOT_idea NOT_to NOT_even NOT_be NOT_visible NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_like NOT_this .  if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie ,  it is gone for sure now .  <br /><br />i've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can't NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_that NOT_is NOT_even NOT_possible . 
1823 1 vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 ,  coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career .  i am not NOT_too NOT_keen NOT_in NOT_romantic NOT_movies NOT_these NOT_days ,  because i see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable .  however ,  i have watched this movie three times now .  .  . and believe me it's an awesome movie . <br /><br />vivah goes back to the traditional route ,  displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage .  the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage .  in that sense sooraj r .  barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie . <br /><br />several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately: <br /><br />* when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride (amrita rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family .  the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene . <br /><br />* the first conversation between shahid and amrita ,  when he comes to see her - i . e .  a shy shahid not NOT_knowing NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_to NOT_talk NOT_about NOT_but NOT_pulling NOT_of NOT_a NOT_decent NOT_conversation .  also amrita's naive nature ,  limited eye-contact ,  shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid's questions . <br /><br />* the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle (alok nath) when she feeds him at shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece . <br /><br />clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way .  the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her .  she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie ,  and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly . <br /><br />shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too .  he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no NOT_less NOT_than NOT_salman NOT_khan NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_to NOT_acting NOT_in NOT_a NOT_sooraj NOT_r .  barjatya film .  in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on-screen couple ,  without a shadow of doubt .  other characters - alok nath (excellent) ,  anupam kher (brilliant) ,  mohan joshi (very good) . <br /><br />on the whole ,  vivah delivers what it promised ,  a well made and realistic story of two families .  the movie has top-notch performances ,  excellent story and great music to suit the film ,  as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r .  barjatya .  it's a must see! 
1824 0  .  .  . for one of the worst swedish movies ever .  .  . forgive me for being dull . <br /><br />first of all i haven't seen the first one (i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one) ,  well i hope the first one is better than this ,  it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes ,  for the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high (belive me so do i) ,  but it made me laugh a few times ,  because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea ,  what's next "det sjunde inseglet ii" .  sequels not NOT_based NOT_on NOT_novel NOT_or NOT_book NOT_doesn't NOT_turning NOT_out NOT_great NOT_to NOT_often ,  and this is a perfect example of one . <br /><br />ok i'm gonna be honest with you: i did laugh a bit ,  it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor .  but don't NOT_buy NOT_it ,  rent it .  just let some other idiot do it or download it . <br /><br />4/10 this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already .  .  . 
1825 1 this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old ,  where actors didn't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_take NOT_their NOT_clothes NOT_off NOT_to NOT_make NOT_viewers NOT_watch NOT_their NOT_film . <br /><br />firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita ,  it is definitely the making of the film . <br /><br />i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy .  in response to this ,  i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis ,  however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk ,  hahk ,  hssh and mpkdh ,  it has been toned down significantly .  hssh was almost unbearable to watch in some places . <br /><br />in this film however ,  when the sentimental moments come along ,  you find yourself smiling ,  wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them . <br /><br />another major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita .  both have acted very well ,  especially shahid who looks great in the film .  amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star . <br /><br />although i really enjoyed the film as a whole ,  i do feel that it was too long .  some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact .  i also think the music ,  although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available .  although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderful . <br /><br />all in all ,  i definitely recommend this film ,  its romantic ,  looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (i won't NOT_go NOT_into NOT_details ,  just in case you haven't seen it . <br /><br />ps .  if you're prone to crying-take a tissue! (i needed several) 
1826 0 ok now ,  lets see .  what was funny in the first movie? i know ,  people with funny accents ,  people falling into the water ,  silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams .  in this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max ,  no NOT_good .  a whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons ,  no NOT_good .  boatcrash ,  check .  funny comments between the two teams ,  they tried but failed .  also ,  there are too may personalities they are following in this movie .  this film should be about what is happening on the water ,  not NOT_on NOT_land .  i am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max .  no NOT_good .  all in all ,  i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts . 
1827 1 this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years .  certainly the best this year until now .  indian to the core ,  the panoramic visuals ,  the heart-pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one .  the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life . <br /><br />this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses .  if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on-screen action ,  sex or terror ,  then this movie is not NOT_for NOT_you ,  because you will find that the movie is not NOT_full NOT_of NOT_90 NOT_degrees NOT_twists NOT_in NOT_it .  it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get .  but that's exactly where the art of the movie lies .  one gets a real life experience ,  and the best thing is ,  this experience is one full of values and hope .  it is about the positive side of life ,  about the sweet things that god has showered on humans ,  as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons ,  terrorists and underworlds .  this is not NOT_about NOT_things NOT_and NOT_people NOT_that NOT_have NOT_gone NOT_bad .  it is about the goodness that still persists ,  and that keeps the world running .  of course ,  every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths .  <br /><br />having said that ,  here's more .  .  .  <br /><br />the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage - yes ,  that's right ,  it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents ,  and learn to love each other .  the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time ,  not NOT_full NOT_of NOT_"enticing" NOT_happenings ,  but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other .  they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives ,  and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage .  but have these been strengthened enough? their relationship will face the test of not NOT_only NOT_time NOT_but NOT_also NOT_fortune .  will they pass this test? that is what "vivah" is about . 
1828 0 (review in english ,  since swedish is not NOT_allowed)<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>i NOT_saw NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_with NOT_extremely NOT_low NOT_expectations ,  and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them . <br /><br />as much as i loved to see janne "loffe" karlsson on the big screen again ,  the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water ,  isn't NOT_original NOT_or NOT_funny .  the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable ,  the ones that ain't ,  is just plain boring .  i smiled like three times during the entire film . <br /><br />the placement of swedish findus products is (unintentionally) funny ,  why not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_big NOT_sign NOT_saying; NOT_"findus NOT_made NOT_it NOT_happen!" . <br /><br />gã¶ta kanal 2 doesn't NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seen NOT_at NOT_the NOT_cinema NOT_or NOT_on NOT_dvd ,  just wait for it to air on tv ,  it wont take too long . 
1829 1 vivah is by no NOT_means NOT_a NOT_classic .  however in the days of hardcore action ,  path-breaking special effects & complex plots (none of which bollywood has mastered yet) ,  its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah .  the story as we all know is a journey from a couple's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times .  nothing more ,  nothing less .  the music isn't NOT_quite NOT_in NOT_the NOT_same NOT_league NOT_as NOT_mpk NOT_or NOT_hahk NOT_but NOT_doesn't NOT_jar NOT_your NOT_senses NOT_either .  two songs stood out for me - mujhe haq hai & do anjaane .  while milan abhi aadha & hamaari shaadi were hummable .  shahid performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential .  its good to see him play something else but the "cool dude" he normally does .  amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl to perfection .  alok nath ,  anupam kher & seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job .  suraj's direction is simple but effective .  the movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers .  but all in all a good ,  clean ,  decent family movie . 
1830 0 yet another forgettable warners foreign intrigue "thriller , " this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall ,  who ,  without humphrey bogart's tender attentions to humanize her ,  comes off as her usual shrill ,  shallow self .  even master gigolo charles boyer cannot feign romantic interest in her . 
1831 1 all the talent mr .  sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies ,  i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad .  but i have to say it wasn't NOT_an NOT_accident .  this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant .  right from the first scene it affects you .  the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome .  the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol .  as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic ,  so is anupam kher .  but its a shahid-amrita film . amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom .  this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life .  all in all a brilliant film .  hats off to mr .  sooraj barjatya .  .  . 
1832 0 lauren bacall and charles boyer do not NOT_provide NOT_the NOT_right NOT_chemistry NOT_here NOT_in NOT_this NOT_1945 NOT_film . <br /><br />there is a good story here about the axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war .  unfortunately ,  this part of the story is not NOT_emphasized .  instead ,  we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer .  by the way ,  bacall is as british as vladimir putin . <br /><br />the real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner katina paxinou .  as was the case with her memorable pilar in the 1943 oscar winner ,  "for whom the bell tolls , " paxinou again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-franco group .  she is quite a vicious character here;especially ,  when she throws a 14 year old child out the window .  she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide . 
1833 1 my comments for vivah :- its a charming ,  idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao .  the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor ,  playing games together ,  their friendly banter and mutual respect .  vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals .  yes ,  the central romance is naively visualized .  but the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism .  the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom ,  on the wedding night ,  tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: "come let me do your dressing"<br /><br />v i v a h - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage ,  beauty of indian culture ,  beauty of indian woman ,  last but not NOT_least NOT_a NOT_nice NOT_idealism NOT_of NOT_the NOT_about-to-be-couple NOT_waiting NOT_to NOT_get NOT_married NOT_ .  .  .  .  playing by the rules ! simple yet beautiful; such a simple story  .  .  .  .  no NOT_plot NOT_ .  .  .  no NOT_villain NOT_- NOT_as NOT_is NOT_the NOT_case NOT_with NOT_most NOT_of NOT_sooraj NOT_barjatya NOT_films .  sooraj sir is back to what he does best .  he has made the movie with full conviction .  its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage & the union of 2 families .  i think amrita rao - looks very good & she has acted very well .  she has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance .  i also liked the acting of all others for ex .  the choti i . e .  amrita prakash ,  alok nath ,  anupam kher ,  shahid's bro & sis-in-law .  it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could .  sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya ,  hahk & hum saath saath hain .  the chemistry between shahid & amrita is awesome . <br /><br />stuff like sanctity in a marriage/relationship ,  avoiding courtship ,  mutual respect ,  care & space ,  waiting for getting married "officially" ,  praying/sacrficing for ur beloved - all these and more get showcased in vivah .  there's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film .  some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing ,  that they r thinking bout arranged-marriage :) thats success if you ask me .  it seems amrita rao - our actress-from-vivah {result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006 !! hats off to her for this achievement chalo ,  even though vivah  ,  shahid or amrita didn't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film-fare NOT_& NOT_other NOT_awards; NOT_@ NOT_least NOT_this NOT_is NOT_news NOT_to NOT_cheer NOT_about NOT_!!

1834 0 this film was done in really poor taste .  the script was really bad .  i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b-movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals .  the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 .  there was a scene where i almost vomited ,  it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded ,  one legged filipino soldier .  the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : `no papa ,  no NOT_mama ,  no NOT_uncle NOT_sam' NOT_and NOT_macarthur NOT_gives NOT_his NOT_little NOT_pep NOT_talk NOT_that NOT_americans NOT_`would NOT_never NOT_abandon' NOT_the NOT_philippines .  the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute .  i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u . s .  as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake .  it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption .  it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe (united states armed forces of the far east) ,  these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war 2 ,  who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese ,  who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous `i shall return' speech .  my late grandfather ,  a filipino world war 2 veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country .  i think this movie does not NOT_give NOT_honor NOT_to NOT_them NOT_and NOT_to NOT_the NOT_thousands NOT_of NOT_others NOT_that NOT_macarthur NOT_relied NOT_on NOT_for NOT_intelligence NOT_preparations NOT_for NOT_his NOT_famous NOT_return NOT_in NOT_the NOT_leyte NOT_gulf NOT_landing .

1836 0 when george c .  scott played the title role in "patton , " you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist ,  shooting at german dive bombers with a revolver ,  and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike .  the most action we get from gregory peck as "macarthur , " a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment ,  is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his . <br /><br />comparing peck's performance with scott's may be unfair .  yet the fact "macarthur" was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels ,  as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at west point .  it's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that oscar-winning film of a few years before .  but while peck looks the part more than scott ever did ,  he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a wikipedia walkthrough of macarthur's later career . <br /><br />"to this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived , " an opening title crawl tells us .  it's a typical dishwater bit of post-vietnam sophistry about those who led america's military ,  very much of its time ,  but what we get here is neither view .  macarthur as presented here doesn't NOT_anger NOT_or NOT_inspire NOT_the NOT_way NOT_he NOT_did NOT_in NOT_life . <br /><br />director joseph sargent ,  who went on to helm the famous turkey "jaws the revenge , " does a paint-by-numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use (as when the chinese attack u . s .  forces in korea) ,  while the script by hal barwood and matthew robbins trots out a macarthur who comes across as good-natured to the point of blandness ,  a bit too caught up in his public image ,  but never NOT_less NOT_than NOT_decent . <br /><br />here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the phillipines .  there you see him addressing congress in his "old soldiers never NOT_die" NOT_speech .  for a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in toyko ,  waiting for the north koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details japan's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule .  peck's co-actors ,  marj dusay as his devoted wife ("you're my finest soldier") and nicolas coaster as a loyal aide ,  burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion's magnificence but garner no NOT_interest NOT_on NOT_their NOT_own . <br /><br />even when he argues with others ,  peck never NOT_raises NOT_his NOT_voice NOT_and NOT_for NOT_the NOT_most NOT_part NOT_wins NOT_his NOT_arguments NOT_with NOT_thunderous NOT_eloquence .  when admiral nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the philippines ,  a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for macarthur ,  macarthur comes back with the comment: "just now ,  as i listened to his plan ,  i thought i saw our flag going down . " doubtless the real nimitz would have had something to say about that ,  but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of president roosevelt . <br /><br />the only person in the movie who macarthur seriously disagrees with is harry s truman ,  who ed flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble toucan sam .  truman's firing of macarthur should be a dramatic high point ,  but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation ,  in which peck plays macarthur as nothing less than a genial martyr . <br /><br />i've never NOT_been NOT_sold NOT_by NOT_peck's NOT_standing NOT_at NOT_the NOT_upper NOT_pantheon NOT_of NOT_screen NOT_stars; NOT_he NOT_delivers NOT_great NOT_presence NOT_but NOT_lacks NOT_complexity NOT_even NOT_in NOT_many NOT_of NOT_his NOT_best-known NOT_roles .  but it's unfair to dock him so much here ,  as he gets little help defining macarthur as anything other than a speechifying bore .  except for two scenes ,  one where he rails against the surrender of the philippines ("he struck old glory and ran up a bedsheet!") and another where he has a mini-breakdown while awaiting the u . s .  invasion of inchon ,  inveighing against communists undermining him at the white house ,  peck really plays peck here ,  not NOT_the NOT_complex NOT_character NOT_who NOT_inspired NOT_the NOT_famous NOT_sobriquet NOT_"american NOT_caesar . " the real macarthur might have been worthy of such a comparison .  what you get here is less worthy of shakespeare than shakes the clown . 
1837 1 if anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this film please read the bottom of this description: first telecast by cbs on november 30 ,  2003 ,  the made-for-tv finding john christmas is a sequel to the previous year's a town without christmas ,  with peter falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel max .  valerie bertinelli plays kathleen mcallister ,  a divorced small-town nurse whose depression .  .  .  over the fact that the hospital er she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $100 , 000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist noah greeley (david cubitt) .  the picture shows an act of bravery performed by noah's firefighter brother hank (william russ) ,  who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasn't been seen since .  hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare ,  but this proves impossible when noah's newspaper posts a $50 , 000 reward to identify hank ,  known only to the public as "john christmas . " and there's something ,  very ,  very curious about that photo: it also shows a santa claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant .  that elusive "santa" is of course the angelic max ,  who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems ,  dispense advice ,  tie up loose plot strands--and even share a musical duet with kathleen's talented daughter socorro (jennifer pisana) . <br /><br />interested in having a copy: write to me here: iamaseal2@yahoo . com 
1838 0 although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw . <br /><br />the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors .  the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch .  reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on . <br /><br />in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off .  geez ,  hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic .  i kept wondering why the victim didn't NOT_start NOT_shouting NOT_" NOT_none NOT_shall NOT_pass" NOT_and NOT_" NOT_it's NOT_only NOT_a NOT_flesh NOT_wound ,  i've had worse" .  it was one of the funniest scenes i've seen in the past year . <br /><br />the "gladiator/demon" was a stitch too .  between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical . <br /><br />truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable .  kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film . <br /><br /> 
1839 1 having been a fan of 'columbo' ,  i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano' .  while certainly a funny movie ,  falk's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years ,  especially with the offensive language he used .  after 'corky romano' ,  i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr .  peter falk .  however ,  having just seen 'finding john christmas' and its predecessor ,  'a town without christmas' ,  for the first time within a week of each other ,  i have to say that 'max' ,  peter's falk's delightful character in both movies ,  is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo' .  while parts of the movie are quite predictable ,  such scenes in no NOT_way NOT_take NOT_away NOT_from NOT_the NOT_enjoyment NOT_of NOT_seeing NOT_the NOT_story NOT_played NOT_out .  i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies ,  and i highly recommend them whether you're a falk fan ,  a christmas nut ,  or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week .  this movie may end up lost among the throngs of made-for-tv holiday flicks ,  so be sure to find 'finding john christmas' before it's too late . 
1840 0 seriously .  i just wrapped up my first viewing of demonicus and words have failed me . <br /><br />i remember a time when i would see charles band's name on a film and my heart would race .  he was never NOT_a NOT_wes NOT_craven NOT_or NOT_a NOT_john NOT_carpenter .  he was a bastion of hope for the little man .  the guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex ,  but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure . <br /><br />and now .  .  .  this . <br /><br />a painfully-obvious californian walking trail doubles for "the alps" and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be "an ancient cave" .  i mean ,  they didn't NOT_even NOT_try NOT_to NOT_dress NOT_the NOT_thing NOT_up NOT_with NOT_moss NOT_or NOT_film NOT_it NOT_in NOT_a NOT_way NOT_that NOT_might NOT_suggest NOT_it NOT_was NOT_anything NOT_other NOT_than NOT_an NOT_old NOT_train NOT_tunnel!

1841 1 this cute animated short features two comic icons - betty boop and henry . <br /><br />henry is the bald ,  slightly portly boy from the comics who never NOT_speaks . <br /><br />well here he does speak!<br /><br />he wants to get a puppy from betty boop's pet store ,  and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue . <br /><br />betty sings a song about pets ,  henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey ,  but everything works out in the end .

1843 1 perhaps in an attempt to find another "hot property" for adaptation ,  the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933's popeye the sailor (fleischer studios/paramount) .  although it was a part of the betty boop series ,  miss b .  only made a brief appearance in the short; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series . <br /><br />as is now common knowledge ,  the gruff ,  squinty eyed ,  brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio ,  lasting to this day . <br /><br />returning to king features for another try at luck was no NOT_doubt NOT_the NOT_reason NOT_for NOT_trying NOT_out NOT_the NOT_very NOT_popular NOT_henry NOT_comic NOT_strip NOT_character NOT_in NOT_a NOT_betty NOT_boop NOT_outing; NOT_objective NOT_being NOT_the NOT_seeking NOT_of NOT_another NOT_series .  the reasoning then surely seemed sound .  henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers' line-up; appearing as both a daily and on sunday's color comics supplement ,  puck ,  the comics weekly .  you know ,  "what fools these mortals be!" remember that one ,  schultz? in viewing the chubby ,  little ,  bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics ,  both solo and in tandem with miss betty; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled .  the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry .  these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime' . <br /><br />in the cartoon ,  titled betty boop with henry: the funniest living american (fleischer studios/paramount pictures corporation ,  1935) ,  we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer's rapid fire ,  machine gun-like gags .  in short ,  henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop's pet shop .  it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had ,  to coins in his pocket .  he is in formed by miss boop that it would be $2 . 00 in depression era money to make the purchase .  tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly . <br /><br />but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store ,  while she leaves on urgent business .  in return for his services ,  miss betty promises him the little dog in return .  of course ,  they have a deal and betty leaves . <br /><br />getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags; this time featuring bird seed ,  henry's bald pate and push brooms .  (but not NOT_all NOT_at NOT_once NOT_of NOT_course ,  schultz!) henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break . <br /><br />betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry's temporary custodial care .  all bets were off ,  no NOT_doggie NOT_for NOT_henry .  he begins to leave; dejectedly; but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up .  his head covered with bird seed ,  he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures; returning them to their pet store coop .  happily ,  the little fella leaves; but this time he has his own affectionate ,  little ,  face licking puppy . <br /><br />undoubetly this was a winning combination .  we have the carefree ,  energy filled ,  free wheeling of the boy ,  the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation .  max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy short . <br /><br />we were quite surprised that no NOT_henry NOT_series NOT_followed .  judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character ,  it certainly could have been sustained for some time .  at any rate ,  this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures .  although the first ,  popeye the sailor (fleischer/paramount ,  1933) ,  was the most successful (and barely had any betty boop in it ,  save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the henry short was much better than the two following king features "tryouts" ,  betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy ,  both 1936 . <br /><br />poodle schnitz!! 
1844 0 this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities ,  it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 grand prix (not i might add ,  the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win) ,  that is how far short this film falls .  now don't NOT_take NOT_this NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_way ,  i love b-movies ,  around half my collection is made of b-movies but i don't NOT_think NOT_there NOT_are NOT_enough NOT_letters NOT_in NOT_the NOT_alphabet NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_how NOT_bad NOT_this NOT_film NOT_is . <br /><br />first of the story (for a b-movie) isn't NOT_that NOT_bad ,  it has potential there to make a b-movie brand ,  were not NOT_talking NOT_friday NOT_13th NOT_potential ,  but potential none the less .  but what really lets this film down is the acting ,  at not NOT_one NOT_second NOT_do NOT_i NOT_believe NOT_anything ,  it's like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tan . <br /><br />in summary i'd like to say i've seen worse films ,  but i can't . 
1845 1 at least for a half hour a week .  i haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks (abc/cbs/nbc) in years .  all of the lions are interesting ,  although larry can get annoying at times .  i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter .  most of the other characters are interesting as well .  the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times ,  too .  the animation is top notch ,  and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show .  usually when they hire big names to star in a show ,  they're trying to hide a poor script or characters .  not NOT_entirely NOT_true NOT_in NOT_this NOT_show NOT_though ,  there's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting ,  but overall the characters stand on their own . <br /><br />this is definitely for 16 and up .  there's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though ,  and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads .  it's definitely not NOT_as NOT_crude NOT_and NOT_edgy NOT_as NOT_south NOT_park ,  but does bring some of the same "bash everyone" feel to it .  one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode .  <br /><br />father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs ,  pinky and the brain ,  and freakazoid .  it's the same type of humor grown up .  it may not NOT_be NOT_as NOT_witty NOT_as NOT_spielberg's NOT_classic NOT_tv NOT_series ,  but it's still good . <br /><br />i hope that it finishes this season off well ,  and is renewed for future seasons .  otherwise i may never NOT_find NOT_a NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_big NOT_3 NOT_again . 
1846 0 for some reason ,  various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first .  james (gregory lee kenyon) enters a cave ,  finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse .  he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead "demonicus" back to life .  this shot-on-digital full moon release is stupid ,  senseless ,  has terrible acting and sound and the (los) angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy .  however ,  it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance .  whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection ,  kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed .  oh well ,  at least he's not NOT_boring NOT_like NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_cast .

1848 0 warning spoilers***** a really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls .  one of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon .  it's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse . <br /><br />a waste of time for the viewers ,  as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on ,  the gore is ludicrous at best ,  and the acting is terrible ,  perfect pairing for such a bad script<br /><br /> 
1849 1 father of the pride is a pleasant surprise: it is funny ,  witty and features some great voice acting .  the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried & roy shows .  indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny .  fotp is not NOT_a NOT_kiddie-cartoon NOT_it NOT_includes NOT_some NOT_crude NOT_adult NOT_humor NOT_but NOT_in NOT_a NOT_very NOT_mild NOT_way .  it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed .  i'd say i'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not NOT_very NOT_original ,  i've seen most of those stereotypes many times before ,  even in that particular order! 
1850 0 okay ,  this movie f*ck in' rules .  it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made .  absolutely terrible ,  but you gotta see it .  rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun ,  it's hilarious .  and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it ,  you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint .  awesome .  okay ,  rent it just for this one scene: two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot .  the director (on the commentary) says "yeah ,  the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're .  .  . " .  yeah ,  right man ,  they are totally walking in place .  it's so funny . 
1851 1 one word: supurrrrb! i don't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_have NOT_see NOT_anything NOT_like NOT_this NOT_in NOT_a NOT_long NOT_time NOT_on NOT_network NOT_or NOT_cable NOT_television .  watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs .  <br /><br />i have to say i had my reservations .  after all ,  critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show .  but when half an hour was over (by the way ,  thank you ,  nbc ,  for running a commercial-free show) ,  i was left with the feeling of instant love ,  love at first glance ,  the true love that one feels in his guts .  everything about this show screamed excellence . <br /><br />graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek .  no NOT_small NOT_feat NOT_considering NOT_those NOT_movies NOT_took NOT_years NOT_to NOT_be NOT_developed . <br /><br />cast was marvelous .  i am partial to john goodman's voice ,  but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john .  special mention: lisa kudrow's guest appearance .  she was on top of the game creating neurotic ,  pudgy ,  and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her .  (panda from brooklyn? only in this show . ) <br /><br />script was funny ,  with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp ,  yet not NOT_tacky .  a note for all parents: this is not NOT_for NOT_children .  this show was never NOT_advertised NOT_as NOT_such ,  and there's a reason why it's set for 9pm ,  not NOT_8pm .  so if you'd like to complain about "objectionable context" ,  save your breath .  adults deserve a comedy made just for them ,  and father of the pride is it .  <br /><br />not everything was perfect .  i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy's characters .  do i sense "stereotype" when it comes to them? yes ,  they are gay .  yes ,  they are flamboyant .  yes ,  they speak with german accents .  but that's yesterday's news .  give us something new ,  something fresh ,  something funny .  putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach .  i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star power" that these guys have .  that's fine by me .  but please don't NOT_dwell NOT_on NOT_something NOT_everybody NOT_already NOT_knows NOT_by NOT_heart .  hopefully ,  the rest of the show is not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_play NOT_the NOT_same NOT_old NOT_record NOT_over NOT_and NOT_over .  <br /><br />in general ,  the show is definitely a must-see-tv .  funny ,  witty ,  with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there haven't been a comedy this good since seinfeld .  i am certainly looking forward to the next episode . 
1852 0 this movie is about tyrannus ,  a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus ,  a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead .  tyrannus ,  we learn after about an hour ,  is also called demonicus .  this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity ,  psychology and ourselves .  <br /><br />the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list (killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin) by possessing the body of a college guy .  he uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this ,  which the college boy willingly puts on his head ,  and then at several points in the movie ,  takes off and puts back on . <br /><br />maria performs oral sex on a poor man's sean willian scott ,  and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove .  tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no NOT_reason ,  and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this .  utter misfortune . <br /><br />this movie is empty and will hurt you .  see it . 
1853 1 i don't NOT_know NOT_why NOT_some NOT_people NOT_criticise NOT_that NOT_show NOT_so NOT_much . <br /><br />it is a great ,  funny show - probably not NOT_the NOT_right NOT_material NOT_for NOT_mainstream NOT_prime-time ,  but still .  .  . <br /><br />the family dynamics are funny ,  and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows .  the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious .  the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried & roy jibes are only just above average ,  but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing . <br /><br />this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it . <br /><br />rating: 8/10 
1854 0 i mean really ,  how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink-ball like demonicus out .  i mean it should never NOT_got NOT_the NOT_green NOT_light NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with .  the story is repetitive ,  the characters are weak at best ,  there is no NOT_real NOT_story NOT_on NOT_tyranus NOT_other NOT_then NOT_he's NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_dude .  then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending .  that's right a bad ending ,  demonicus rises .  the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in ,  then a picture of chimera comes to life ,  cheaply i might add and chases her out .  then as she is walking home ala funhouse .  a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no NOT_reason NOT_just NOT_to NOT_collapse NOT_on NOT_top NOT_of NOT_her .  i mean ,  that makes no NOT_sense .  what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made ,  with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies .  they could have asked me ,  i had better ideas then demonicus .  thanksgiving turkey . 
1855 1 "father of the pride " was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_very NOT_long NOT_life NOT_ .  and that is pretty sad  , specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air ( think in "the simple life ") i admit that are many similarities with this show and "the simpsons"  , but despite the similarities  , the show have it own merits  .  the animation is just adequate  , not NOT_incredible NOT_ , but is good  . the best are the characters  .  all the animals are very likable and funny  ,  and even sigfried and roy had their moments  .  the music was good  , i liked many of the songs  . <br /><br />even if the show isn't NOT_very NOT_original NOT_ , i think that this had lots of potential  . like "mission hill " a show that isn't NOT_very NOT_famous NOT_but NOT_i NOT_liked NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_ ,  this didn't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_appreciation NOT_that NOT_it NOT_deserved NOT_ .  what a shame  . 
1856 0 this movie is so awful ,  it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />at first the story is so ridiculous . a narrow-minded human can write a better plot! the actors are boring and untalented ,  perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film . <br /><br />the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie .  i should feel ashame ,  because i paid for this lousy picture . <br /><br />hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-) 
1857 1 i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television ,  but unfortunately ,  started a job that got me working evenings .  i managed to catch some recordings of it ,  at least .  .  .  and ,  of course ,  purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series .  watching the dvd ,  you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first ,  but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done .  the voices are well suited to the characters ,  and the writing is excellent .  it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes .  thing is ,  with the way society has come in the last century ,  you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show .  the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life .  it's your typical sitcom in that regard ,  but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live .  .  .  back when snl was actually funny .  good job ,  dreamworks .  perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going .  .  .  and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs .  it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though .  hmm .  .  . 
1858 0 my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh .  we saw this one on fullmoondirect . com and decided to add it to our netflix list .  now ,  when i say this movie is awful ,  i mean it in a good way .  everything about it ,  the acting ,  camera-work ,  story ,  costumes ,  is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good .  i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place .  i really hope that whoever made this film wasn't NOT_serious NOT_when NOT_they NOT_made NOT_it NOT_because NOT_if NOT_they NOT_were ,  then that would just be sad .  if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one . 
1859 1 father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy .  it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation .  like the simpsons ,  the show centers around a nuclear family (of white lions ,  in this case) .  it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan ,  vincent the italian-american flamingo ,  the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria ,  the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant .  the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy .  they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner ,  making the most mundane activities entertaining .  the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues (drugs ,  prejudice ,  etc) is the source of the program's brilliance . <br /><br />the blame for this show's failure lies with nbc .  they opted to broadcast the episodes in no NOT_particular NOT_order NOT_(perhaps NOT_being NOT_influenced NOT_by NOT_which NOT_guest NOT_stars NOT_they NOT_could NOT_promote) NOT_rather NOT_than NOT_the NOT_more NOT_logical NOT_production NOT_order .  several times ,  the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of such dreck as the biggest loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not NOT_enough)! NOT_it NOT_is NOT_indeed NOT_an NOT_ill NOT_omen NOT_for NOT_the NOT_future NOT_of NOT_television NOT_as NOT_art NOT_if NOT_an NOT_original NOT_and NOT_daring NOT_show NOT_like NOT_this NOT_fails NOT_while NOT_fear NOT_factor NOT_and NOT_american NOT_idol NOT_dominate . <br /><br />luckily ,  the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following .  10/10 
1860 0 some kids are hiking in the mountains ,  and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator .  he puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers . <br /><br />this thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening .  here's a short list of things that don't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_sense:<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>1) NOT_a NOT_guy NOT_and NOT_a NOT_girl NOT_are NOT_in NOT_their NOT_tent NOT_and NOT_they NOT_think NOT_they NOT_hear NOT_something NOT_outside .  the guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside .  then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? he was only 50 feet away!<br /><br />2) these two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (what ,  100 feet away?) ,  but don't NOT_investigate NOT_because NOT_they're NOT_afraid NOT_they'll NOT_get NOT_lost . <br /><br />3) another guy and a girl are walking around ,  and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances ,  protocol no NOT_longer NOT_requires NOT_him NOT_to NOT_address NOT_her NOT_as NOT_professor .  i mean ,  what the .  .  . ? first off ,  that's just a really stupid thing to say ,  secondly he never NOT_called NOT_her NOT_professor NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_nine NOT_scenes NOT_they NOT_were NOT_in NOT_together . <br /><br />4) a wounded girl attacks demonicus and he stops her ,  telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing .  um ,  yeah ,  we kinda noticed she's wounded and not NOT_dead NOT_because NOT_she's NOT_up NOT_and NOT_walking NOT_around .  but ,  thanks for that tidbit of information . <br /><br />5) one girl is tied up in demonicus' lair ,  and when someone attempts to free her ,  she instead instructs this person to go and get help .  um ,  look ,  idiot ,  if she set you free ,  which would take about 5 seconds ,  there would be no NOT_need NOT_to NOT_get NOT_help . <br /><br />and it just goes on and on .  the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods ,  then they fight ,  then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends ,  then they wander around some more .  it's just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through .  <br /><br />none of these characters are sympathetic ,  especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time .  demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him - he looks like a kid in a halloween costume ,  scrunching his face up to look evil .  he runs ,  or should i say scampers around like he's gay .  the special effects are comedic ,  the acting is for the most part awful ,  and nothing makes any sense . <br /><br />overall ,  maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it ,  getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue ,  creating characters with actual likable personalities ,  having some sort of logical flow to the action ,  and maybe even making demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit .  but no ,  instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death . 
1861 1 i'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits (the ghosts of christmas past ,  present and yet to come) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways .  dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite . <br /><br />while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims ,  and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge ,  i have been impressed with this version ,  which was released when i was in high school .  george c .  scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge ,  and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing .  david warner is a good bob cratchit as well . <br /><br />this version is beautifully filmed ,  and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980's) which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version . <br /><br />this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season . 
1862 0 i cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made .  there are about four good looking shots (the director should think about switching to still photography) and that's it .  a strong cast is utterly wasted ,  scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new .  please spare yourself this movie . 
1863 1 i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite .  george c . scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not NOT_give .  the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter .  the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him .  <br /><br />this movie has the best tiny tim by far .  he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films .  anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth .  <br /><br />david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit .  he is such a versatile actor .  he portrays a man who clearly loves his family .  he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for .  susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life .  edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i've ever seen .  most often he is played as a jolly santa type character .  in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider .  <br /><br />the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life .  a wonderful movie . 
1864 0 i watched this movie ,  and hoped for something to get better the entire time .  what is so great about a guy with no NOT_emotion? NOT_*yawn*<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>you NOT_never NOT_see NOT_alex NOT_show NOT_emotion NOT_for NOT_anyone NOT_other NOT_than NOT_his NOT_son .  yeah ,  i know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper (if you can call it that) ,  i get it . <br /><br />characters are undeveloped ,  relationships aren't NOT_given NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_to NOT_be NOT_understood .  in one scene sarah says they won't NOT_fall NOT_in NOT_love ,  and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close? logic synapses abound in this film . <br /><br />it's like someone watched boogie nights and wrote this part to mimic little bill .  even the scene where he "loses his temper" is the same as when little bill shoots his wife ,  down to the facial expression (or lack thereof) .  yes ,  william h .  macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there ,  done that - can you say magnolia?<br /><br />this movie didn't NOT_only NOT_lack NOT_emotion ,  it lacked substance ,  a good script ,  developed characters ,  and a plot .  and it certainly lacks my recommendation .  :)<br /><br />~a~ 
1865 1 *********ten out of ten stars********* <br /><br />it's hard to believe this was a made for television movie .  just the phrase ,  "made of tv" ,  makes me shudder .  the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios .  that being said ,  this version of the "christmas carol" should have been released in theaters ,  because it is that good .  it's my personal favorite of all the "christmas carol" movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality .  yes ,  there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge ,  but there isn't NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_in NOT_existence NOT_that NOT_doesn't NOT_have NOT_at NOT_least NOT_a NOT_couple NOT_of NOT_mistakes . <br /><br />scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge ,  he's a pleasure to watch .  in fact ,  i can't NOT_think NOT_of NOT_one NOT_performance NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_that NOT_shouldn't NOT_be NOT_applauded .  the costuming ,  location shooting ,  and winter backdrop are mesmerizing .  the musical score is endearing and heart warming .  add to that ,  solid directing ,  flawless cinematography ,  and faithful scripting; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic .  it really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic ,  but mark my words ,  one day soon it will be .  this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas: love ,  selflessness ,  and giving .  in as selfish ,  greedy world ,  my family and i can lose ourselves in "the christmas carol" ,  starring george c .  scott .

1867 1 i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time ,  and i was really excited about seeing it ,  and when i heard that george c .  scott was in it ,  i was really excited ,  because i really love george c .  scott! when me and my class were watching this movie ,  i was really into it ,  and when it was over ,  i was really impressed ,  i thought that it was totally fabulous! this is the best version of charles dickens' classic novel that i have seen so far! george c .  scott's performance as scrooge is something else ,  i thought that he was the perfect choice ,  he was scrooge ,  he is the definitive scrooge! i've seen two different versions of a christmas carol ,  the other is the one with patrick stewart ,  but this is the better one! <br /><br />what it really great about this is the acting ,  i thought that the actors were fabulous ,  everyone was ,  the spirits ,  tiny tim ,  bob cratchit ,  everyone ,  they could not NOT_have NOT_found NOT_anyone NOT_better NOT_than NOT_the NOT_ones NOT_they NOT_had NOT_doing NOT_the NOT_parts!

NOT_i NOT_don't NOT_think NOT_that NOT_they NOT_could NOT_have NOT_found NOT_anyone NOT_better NOT_to NOT_replace NOT_anyone NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie! NOT_<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>this NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_probably NOT_the NOT_definitive NOT_movie NOT_adaption NOT_of NOT_the NOT_classic NOT_by NOT_charles NOT_dickens ,  and i really think that you will agree ,  you will think that this movie is fabulous! i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd ,  because i thought that it was totally fabulous! i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! this is the best version of a christmas carol ,  period .  <br /><br />10/10 
1868 0 macy ,  ullman and sutherland were as great as usual .  ritter wasn't NOT_bad NOT_either .  what's her name was as pretty as usual .  it could have been a good movie .  to bad the plot was atrocious .  it was completely predictable ,  trite and boring . <br /><br />from the first 15 minutes ,  the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine .  the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard .  there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting ,  which was a pity . <br /><br />finally ,  too bad the script writer wasn't NOT_the NOT_victim .  especially with the "precocious" lines from the child ,  which were completely unbelievable . <br /><br />again ,  it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score . 
1869 1 in our household ,  we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas ,  including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart .  our overall favorite is the 1951 black & white classic ,  because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest .  however ,  this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story ,  quite faithful generally to dickens' novel .  (see my comments on the other film adaptations ,  if interested)<br /><br />first of all ,  george c .  scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_scrooge .  i adore his sideburns ,  his long topcoat & hat .  he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot ,  and quite a handsome gentleman .  however ,  sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not NOT_taking NOT_it NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_seriously NOT_as NOT_he NOT_ought!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>this NOT_rendition NOT_has NOT_the NOT_best NOT_overall NOT_christmas NOT_atmosphere ,  hopeful and optimistic .  somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending .  filmed in the town of shrewsbury ,  england ,  it just seems somehow very british .  the film has a lovely musical score ,  with wonderful ,  lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale .  sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper! <br /><br />marley's anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three spirits are all quite convincing .  christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady ,  christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial ,  christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always .  however ,  i found scrooge's nephew ,  fred ,  a wee bit quiet & grim ,  not NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_jolly NOT_& NOT_hearty NOT_as NOT_he NOT_should NOT_be .  i like the nephew's wife ,  whom they've named janet ,  with her lovely ,  sprightly period hairstyle .  instead of blind man's bluff ,  they've concocted a game called similes for the nephew's christmas dinner party ,  which is a cute little touch ,  scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing . <br /><br />the cratchits and their somewhat meagre (though much appreciated) christmas dinner are well depicted ,  with bob (david warner) suitably sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles of scarf .  mrs .  cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york ,  who also starred with george c .  scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre .  above all ,  this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim ,  not NOT_only NOT_an NOT_adorable NOT_& NOT_endearing NOT_little NOT_waif NOT_but NOT_sickly .  with those dark circles under his eyes ,  the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour!<br /><br />this is a delightful & heartwarming version of the holiday classic .  with its festive atmosphere ,  it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season . 
1870 0 users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_enough NOT_good NOT_films NOT_to NOT_compare NOT_it NOT_with .  have they all been brainwashed?? i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie . <br /><br />from the first ,  bu is just a chase film .  we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another .  and another .  and another .  and another .  do you see a pattern emerging? there is virtually no NOT_time NOT_'wasted' NOT_on NOT_plot ,  character development ,  or boring old reality . <br /><br />if you haven't see the other two bourne films ,  you're pretty lost .  if you have - you only wish you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema . <br /><br />paul greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen ,  but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character .  he runs .  he jumps .  he punches .  he gets blown up .  he clears tall buildings .  yada yada yada .  above all - he survives .  he survives like a plastic action man survives ,  which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension .  so he drives off a building? so what? he'll survive .  yawn . <br /><br />there's a girl thrown into the mix because bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation ,  but she's just decor .  i've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet . <br /><br />bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't NOT_know NOT_from NOT_the NOT_first NOT_movie .  he was turned into a killing machine .  big deal .  he finds out his true identity .  so what? it doesn't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_emotional NOT_resonance NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes . <br /><br />the 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak .  oh ,  dear ,  the more i think about this film the more i hate it! i've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! i'd better end now before the slide continues . <br /><br />i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller .  the bourne ultimatum is neither .  it's a loud ,  tedious series of flashy edits ,  ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence .  <br /><br />the idea that it 'shows the way' to the bond franchise is utter crap .  casino royale blows it out of the water . 
1871 1 this version of the charles dickens novel features george c scott as the scrooge .  fine casting ,  especially the choice of scott ,  who plays the role to the hilt .  . a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption .  a modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten .  . 9 
1872 0 i don't NOT_understand NOT_people .  why is it that this movie is getting an 8 . 3!!!!!!???? i had high hopes for this movie ,  but once i was about a half hour into it i just wanted to leave the theater .  in the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they've seen (or of the summer ,  year ,  etc . ) they say it's an excellent conclusion .  wtf!!!!!!!!!?????? what has been concluded (besides the fact that bourne can ride motorcycles ,  shoot ,  and fight better than anyone else he comes across)? what do you learn about bourne's character in this movie?????????absolutely f****** nothing!!!!!!! okay ,  there's a lot of action ,  but what's so great about the action in this movie?? i don't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_cinematography NOT_and NOT_film NOT_editing .  the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast (i didn't NOT_mind NOT_them NOT_in NOT_supremacy NOT_because NOT_it NOT_was NOT_still NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_and NOT_was NOT_not NOT_used NOT_in NOT_excess) NOT_and NOT_made NOT_me NOT_quite NOT_dizzy .  i was quickly wishing i had saved my $$$ for something else . <br /><br />this movie has no NOT_plot .  all this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen .  bourne ,  who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie ,  is a perfectionist at everything he attempts .  there is absolutely no NOT_character NOT_development NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie ,  you know nothing about anyone ,  and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment .  some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense .  ???????????!!!!!!!! what writing???? what suspense??? there's no NOT_suspense .  bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does ,  i don't NOT_think NOT_he NOT_has NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_worry NOT_about .  if this is the best movie of the year 2007 i may just quit watching movies entirely!!!! <br /><br />many people have also said that matt damon's performance in this movie is one of the best (if not NOT_the NOT_best) NOT_of NOT_his NOT_career .  what performance?? how many lines did he have in this movie??? i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters ,  but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next ,  someone who chooses different types of roles .  not NOT_someone NOT_who NOT_plays NOT_the NOT_same NOT_roles NOT_over NOT_and NOT_over NOT_again NOT_(which NOT_damon NOT_doesn't NOT_do ,  but an example of someone who does is vin diesel) . <br /><br />anyways ,  this movie was a big disappointment to me .  i do not NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_i NOT_do NOT_recommend NOT_the NOT_first NOT_two NOT_(bourne NOT_identity NOT_and NOT_bourne NOT_supremacy) NOT_and NOT_i NOT_most NOT_definitely NOT_recommend NOT_reading NOT_the NOT_three NOT_books NOT_(which NOT_are NOT_much NOT_different NOT_then NOT_the NOT_movies) . 
1873 1 everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories â– a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains .  so that he can avoid his partner's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past ,  present and yet to come ,  so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late .  a rather morbid tale one might think ,  but it is classic charles dickens ,  and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all time . <br /><br />to me this is the definitive version of dickens' timeless story; it's the one i always remember watching in school ,  and i remember being absolutely terrified by it! the ghost of jacob marley ,  the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge ,  and the ghost of christmas yet-to-come especially i found very frightening .  how on earth did the film gain the 'u' certificate? (for non-uk readers 'u' is the lowest classification ,  it means family friendly and children welcome ,  nothing to scare them etc .  .  .  this is certainly not NOT_the NOT_case NOT_though ,  as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper-like spectre of christmas future . <br /><br />be that as it may ,  from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film ,  this is possibly the most faithful to the book .  most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his robe (you'd never NOT_get NOT_away NOT_with NOT_a NOT_scene NOT_like NOT_that NOT_nowadays!) .  the two children represent ignorance and need (although changed to want in this film) . <br /><br />criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes ,  the main one of which being that george c .  scott's portrayal of scrooge seems simply not NOT_cold NOT_enough .  he laughs too much .  i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_use NOT_the NOT_word NOT_jolly NOT_because NOT_of NOT_course NOT_ebeneezer NOT_is NOT_anything NOT_but ,  but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man ,  rather than the positively unkind ,  cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films .  patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed ,  and michael caine ,  despite acting alongside the muppets ,  was positively cold .  further ,  the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent .  he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit's final lesson . <br /><br />but ignoring this one (albeit major) quibble ,  it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart-warming christmas tale ,  as all christmas films should be .  london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow-covered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is (the truth is that even then that london was grey and grimy â– and any snow would never NOT_have NOT_been NOT_so NOT_white!) NOT_and NOT_everyone NOT_is NOT_so NOT_impeccably NOT_dressed NOT_too ,  even the poor people look rather dapper .  but of course it's a christmas film ,  so why shouldn't everything look nice? perfect holiday season viewing; coupled with copies of it's a wonderful life ,  miracle on 34th street and the snowman and you've got everything you need . 
1874 0 how sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be .  as soon as a few critics say something new is good (ie - "shake-cam") ,  everyone jumps on the bandwagon ,  as if they are devoid of independent thought .  this was not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_movie ,  it was a dreadful movie .  1) plot? - what plot? bourne was chased from here to there ,  from beginning to end .  that's the plot .  don't NOT_look NOT_for NOT_anything NOT_deeper NOT_than NOT_this .  2) cinematography? - do me a favor! any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job (i am not NOT_exaggerating NOT_here) .  this film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work .  the ridiculous shaking of every (i really do mean every) scene will cause dizziness and nausea .  3) believable? - oh yes definitely .  this is a masterpiece of credibility .  i loved scenes about bourne being chased by (local) police through the winding market streets of tangier .  - i've been to tangier .  even the guides can't NOT_navigate NOT_their NOT_way NOT_through NOT_those NOT_streets NOT_but NOT_bourne NOT_shook NOT_off NOT_100 NOT_police NOT_with NOT_speed NOT_and NOT_finesse .  greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples .  4) editing? - i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_the NOT_editor NOT_was NOT_on NOT_when NOT_he NOT_did NOT_this NOT_film NOT_but NOT_i NOT_want NOT_some! NOT_- NOT_every NOT_scene NOT_is NOT_between NOT_0 . 5 and 2 seconds .  i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the "scenes" flashing by .  5) directing? - hmmm .  this is an interesting aspect .  the film appears to have actually not NOT_had NOT_any NOT_directing .  more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script (all two pages) at the cameramen and told to "shoot a few scenes whilst drunk" .  - "don't worry boys ,  we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room" .  the editor should be tarred ,  feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6) not NOT_one NOT_but NOT_two NOT_senior NOT_cia NOT_operatives NOT_giving NOT_the NOT_tender NOT_feminine NOT_treatment NOT_to NOT_the NOT_mistreated NOT_and NOT_misunderstood NOT_jason NOT_bourne .  - putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't NOT_a NOT_traitor .  talk about stupid nincompoops .  (whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor) .  (well ,  all men are evil ,  aren't NOT_they? NOT_- NOT_except NOT_for NOT_snags NOT_of NOT_course) .  yes ,  this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity .  7) when the you-know-what finally hits the fan ,  good triumphs over evil (just like it always does ,  eh?) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger (yeah - right .  .  . ) - at that very moment ,  the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger .  - how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not NOT_even NOT_be NOT_out NOT_of NOT_breath? NOT_wonders NOT_will NOT_never NOT_cease NOT_8) NOT_don't NOT_worry ,  there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts .  well ,  we can't NOT_have NOT_nasty ,  politically incorrect ,  cia operatives going round shooting people ,  can we? how lovely to see a true to life p . c .  film of the noughties .  -------------the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish . 
1875 1 when this initially aired in 1984 ,  my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder .  i still have that aging tape ,  which i try to watch annually .  it was the year my first child was born ,  and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times -- many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background .  i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd ,  which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie .  charles dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here .  george c .  scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge .  the supporting cast is equally spectacular .  this is ,  to my mind ,  a flawless production .  little details add much to the enjoyment .  the game "similes" scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item .  (i've since re-created it with my high school english students as a brief respite from class work!) honestly ,  i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production ,  which was originally sponsored by ibm .  (incidentally ,  it's fun to watch the old tape with the original ibm commercials  .  .  .  which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years .  amazing how things have changed!) bottom line: a christmas carol is a timeless story ,  and this rendition is a timeless classic .  enjoy  .  .  .  and god bless us ,  every one! 
1876 0 i may not NOT_be NOT_the NOT_one NOT_to NOT_review NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_after NOT_45 NOT_minutes NOT_of NOT_pure NOT_boredom NOT_and NOT_stupidity NOT_i NOT_turned NOT_the NOT_channel .  the original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for adam west and burt ward .  put these two "actors" in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad . 
1877 1 although george c .  scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent ,  he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge . <br /><br />particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie's end .  as scott stands before a large window ,  sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette .  augmented by scott's voice ,  a ponderous growl ,  the effect is galvanizing .  .  . much like marlon brando's first scene in apocalypse now .  "the horror , " indeed! <br /><br />however ,  as they say ,  the very thing that works for you can also work against you .  because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie ,  it proves infectious .  to put it another way ,  the "before" scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after , " even though he really shouldn't be .  it's what you might call the "doctor smith" effect ,  since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike) . <br /><br />actually ,  i myself don't NOT_consider NOT_scott's NOT_glib NOT_rage NOT_a NOT_liability .  but other "christmas carol" purists might .  see the film and judge for yourselves . 
1878 0 i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this .  but they tried to do too much . <br /><br />why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me .  i don't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_knock NOT_burt NOT_or NOT_adam NOT_for NOT_the NOT_way NOT_they NOT_look NOT_now .  .  .  .  . it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin ,  but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad .  i would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary .  the batmobile side story was stupid . <br /><br />as for the flashback movie ,  i think it was too short and left out way too much .  it was really just a quick overview in my opinion .  i'd like more background .  they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew .  the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker .  that was it on those 2 . <br /><br />i'd love to read the book .  i am sure it has more in it that this showed .  like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman's or 3 mister freezes .  where was commishioner gordon ,  cheif ohara ,  alfred ,  mister freeze ,  king tut ,  etc .  the list goes on .  like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it . <br /><br />very disappointing .  and really corny . 
1879 1 okay ,  there are a ton of reviews here ,  what can i possibly add?<br /><br />i will try anyway .  <br /><br />the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything .  the sets ,  outdoor locations ,  costumes are so beautiful and authentic .  the music is sweet .  the supporting cast is very well done .  one of my favorites is the narrator & nephew ,  played by roger rees .  his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me .  david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit .  his is a difficult life ,  but he remains positive and dignified .  <br /><br />the best part of course- is george c .  scott as ebenezer scrooge .  some have said his portrayal too gruff .  i couldn't disagree more .  his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh ,  weren't NOT_out NOT_of NOT_character .  he is a terribly disillusioned man who's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth .  <br /><br />during the flashbacks ,  it's obvious that he isn't NOT_all NOT_gruff .  this is where we see that there is hope for him .  if he was totally gone ,  his partner marley would never NOT_have NOT_come NOT_for NOT_his NOT_sake NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_place .  and after all ,  we are none of us past hoping .  i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say .  when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer's with belle ,  you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life "with a grin on my face . " clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film .  sometimes they get left on the editing room floor . <br /><br />and finally ,  his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it .  his apology to his nephew fred ,  so sincere ,  so moving ,  it is the spirit not NOT_only NOT_of NOT_christmas ,  but of humanity itself .  the joy he brings to fred ,  to his wife are so apparent .  and the line that gets me every time ,  "god forgive me for the time i've wasted . " <br /><br />bravi tutti! 
1880 0 okay guys ,  we know why we watch film like "the invisible maniac" (just look at the cover ,  man!) .  t and a all over the place (with a lot more t than a) .  but .  .  . shouldn't there be a story to go with it?<br /><br />"c'mon , " i can hear you say - "this is just girls gettin' naked! who needs a story??!"<br /><br />well ,  if this were called "the naked maniacs" ,  i wouldn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_problem .  but since these guys are cribbing from "the invisible man" ,  they need to have a bit of story hereabouts ,  you know ,  to keep your mind busy . <br /><br />however ,  all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and ,  when he cracks ,  uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers .  and when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after ,  you'll be grateful . <br /><br />one star ,  for the t and a ,  but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans ,  so proceed with caution . <br /><br />tidbit - yes ,  it's that savannah . 
1881 1 ok .  i'm biased .  i live near shrewsbury in england ,  where this wonderful movie was filmed .  it still looks the same now .  i remember them filming here quite vividly ,  and the fake snow on the streets for days on end .  often ,  when i'm walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film . <br /><br />george c .  scott's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions .  his physical appearance isn't NOT_the NOT_typical NOT_miser .  scott's is big and imposing .  a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior . <br /><br />we all know the story and the quotes .  the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language .  and i don't NOT_believe NOT_there NOT_are NOT_many NOT_cynics NOT_who NOT_would NOT_say NOT_that NOT_people NOT_aren't NOT_capable NOT_of NOT_change NOT_and NOT_redemption .  this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully .  george c .  scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skill . <br /><br />i love this movie .  if you haven't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do .  it's usually available for a very small amount of money .  .  .  or are you too mean? 
1882 0 this movie is just plain bad .  it isn't NOT_even NOT_worth NOT_watching NOT_to NOT_make NOT_fun NOT_of NOT_it .  the lunatic professor is just plain annoying .  even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility (which i glady do for the sake of good bad movies) and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie ,  this movie asks for even more than that .  if you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes ,  and random sexual encounters ,  get a porn ,  if you are looking for a good-bad movie ,  get something else .  if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie ,  rent this . 
1883 1 i first saw this version of "a christmas carol" when it first appeared on television .  i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations .  i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year .  with the exception of "it's a wonderful life" i consider this version of "a christmas carol" one of the best christmas movies ever made .  george c .  scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him! scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time .  scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself .  how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge? scott does so easily .  the direction is marvelous with the fine sets ,  costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time ,  place and era depicted .  you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season . 
1884 0 saw this late one night on cable .  at the time i didn't NOT_know NOT_that NOT_the NOT_girl NOT_billed NOT_as NOT_"shannon NOT_wilsey" NOT_was NOT_actually NOT_porn NOT_star NOT_savannah ,  but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often ,  thank god) that i actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel .  i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy--more than the next guy ,  actually--but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid .  the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director's ,  writers' and special effects people's virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie's only saving grace .  savannah ,  before she turned into the plasticized barbie doll she became as a porn queen ,  is really interesting to watch--she's drop-dead gorgeous ,  bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times ,  glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time ,  which is more than can be said for the audience .  for even though savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked ,  it still can't NOT_hide NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_this NOT_is NOT_an NOT_incredibly NOT_stupid ,  badly made and annoying movie .  if you know someone who has it on video ,  or if it comes on cable some night ,  check it out ,  but don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_money NOT_on NOT_a NOT_rental . 
1885 1 this is the best film version of dicken's classic tale .  i've seen it over and over on vhs ,  and recently acquired the dvd version ,  which is formatted for tv (not wide-screen) .  what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in north america since 1984 .  my biggest surprise is edward woodward ,  "the equalizer" ,  as the ghost of christmas present . 
1886 0 here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "low budget" a horrible name .  our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization" .  students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies .  sounds like a resurrection of classic b-movies from the 50s ,  right? nope! it's not NOT_an NOT_example NOT_of NOT_high NOT_camp NOT_fun ,  which is way ,  way off the mark .  a glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure ,  opposing the horror that should have had 99 . 44% more in the first place .  bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best ,  aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies .  atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic guru the mad monk (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a master's degree in film production! it's an automatic "f" ,  so rest easy! 
1887 1 i saw a lot films about charles dickens' christmas carol .  but this one is the best of all! there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book .  the actors (george c .  scott and others) are great! unfortunately ,  you can't NOT_often NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_film NOT_in NOT_germany NOT_and NOT_switzerland . 
1888 0 take one look at the cover of this movie ,  and you know right away that you are not NOT_about NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_a NOT_landmark NOT_film .  this is cheese filmmaking in every respect ,  but it does have its moments .  despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives ,  the story is actually interesting at some points ,  although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends .  the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot ,  which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention . <br /><br />in the nutty professor ,  a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer ,  whereas in the invisible maniac ,  a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible ,  allowing him to spy on (and kill ,  for some reason) his students .  boring fodder .  don't NOT_expect NOT_any NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_mental NOT_stimulation NOT_from NOT_this ,  and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick .  .  . 
1889 1 you could stage a version of charles dickens' "a christmas carol" with sock puppets and i'll probably watch it .  ever since i was a child ,  this has been one of my favorite stories .  maybe it's the idea that there is good in everyone ,  and that therefore no NOT_one NOT_is NOT_beyond NOT_redemption ,  that appeals to me ,  but for whatever reason i never NOT_miss NOT_an NOT_opportunity NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_many NOT_screen NOT_adaptations NOT_of NOT_this NOT_timeless NOT_classic NOT_when NOT_they're NOT_on NOT_tv NOT_as NOT_they NOT_inevitably NOT_are NOT_this NOT_time NOT_of NOT_year . <br /><br />what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles .  lines we've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity ,  and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble . <br /><br />george c .  scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role .  it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft-portrayed role of scrooge ,  he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was ,  in my opinion ,  one of his finest performances ever .  he wisely did not NOT_attempt NOT_a NOT_british NOT_accent ,  instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice .  his scrooge is not NOT_merely NOT_a NOT_cranky NOT_old NOT_man NOT_(as NOT_he NOT_is NOT_so NOT_often NOT_portrayed) ,  but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world .  as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits ,  we understand how this anger took root ,  grew ,  and ultimately strangled his soul .  as he is forced to review his life ,  we see him alternately softening ,  and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy .  and in the great dramatic scene when he ,  kneeling and weeping at his own grave ,  begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life ,  we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively .  scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully human . <br /><br />impressive as scott's performance is ,  the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty .  fred holywell ,  scrooge's nephew ,  is an excellent example of this .  often portrayed as an affable buffoon ,  here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals .  when he implores scrooge ,  "i ask nothing of you .  i want nothing from you .  why can't NOT_we NOT_be NOT_friends?" ,  we see in his face not NOT_only NOT_his NOT_frustration ,  but his pain at scrooge's self-imposed separation from his only living relative .  it is a moving performance ,  and one of the movie's most dramatic scenes . <br /><br />even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge's late partner ,  jacob marley .  in most versions of this tale ,  the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film ,  simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly ,  and the results are usually just plain silly (ooooh ,  look ,  it's a scary ghost .  .  .  .  .  .  . not!) in this version ,  it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie .  marley's entrance ,  as the locks on scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house ,  is wonderfully creepy .  but finlay's marley is no NOT_ethereal NOT_spirit .  he is a tortured soul ,  inspiring both horror and pity .  marley may be a ghost ,  but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth ,  and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress ,  are still very human .  as portrayed by finlay ,  we have no NOT_problem NOT_believing NOT_that NOT_even NOT_the NOT_flinty NOT_scrooge NOT_would NOT_be NOT_shaken NOT_by NOT_this NOT_nightmarish NOT_apparition .  finlay really steals the scene here ,  something not NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_do NOT_when NOT_you're NOT_opposite NOT_george NOT_c .  scott . <br /><br />and it just goes on and on ,  one remarkable performance after another ,  making it seem like you're experiencing this story for the first time .  edward woodward (remember him from the equalizer?) is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present .  when he delivers the famous line ,  "it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child" he is no NOT_longer NOT_a NOT_jolly NOT_santa NOT_claus NOT_surrogate ,  but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spanking . <br /><br />susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs .  cratchit ,  and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit ,  a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty ,  a sick child ,  and an insufferable boss .  his face alternately shows his cheerful courage ,  and also ,  at times ,  his weariness ,  in the face of intolerable circumstances .  later ,  in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim ,  warner's performance ,  while hardly uttering a word ,  will move you to tears . 
1890 0 the invisible maniac starts as a young kevin dornwinkle (kris russell) is caught by his strict mother (marilyn adams) watching a girl (tracy walker) strip through his telescope .  .  .  cut to 'twenty years later' & kevin dornwinkle (noel peters) is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a 'mollecular reconstruction' serum .  however during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails & they all laugh at him ,  dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them & is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes .  jump forward 'two weeks later' & a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress mrs .  cello (stephanie blake as stella blalack) says that she has hired a replacement ,  yes you've guessed it it's dornwinkle .  the student don't NOT_take NOT_to NOT_him NOT_& NOT_treat NOT_him NOT_like NOT_dirt ,  however dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum & uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges & his desire for revenge .  .  . <br /><br />co-written & directed by adam rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym rif coogan (i wouldn't NOT_want NOT_my NOT_name NOT_to NOT_be NOT_associated NOT_with NOT_this NOT_turd NOT_of NOT_a NOT_film NOT_either) NOT_the NOT_invisible NOT_maniac NOT_is NOT_real NOT_bottom NOT_of NOT_the NOT_barrel NOT_stuff .  the script by rifkin ,  sorry coogan & tony markes is awful .  it tries to be a teenage sex/comedy/horror hybrid that just fails in every department .  for a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes & a few boob shots ,  not NOT_much NOT_else NOT_i'm NOT_afraid NOT_& NOT_the NOT_birds NOT_in NOT_the NOT_invisible NOT_maniac NOT_aren't NOT_even NOT_that NOT_good NOT_looking .  the comedy is lame & every joke misses by the proverbial mile ,  this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having henry (jason logan) a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny .  the invisible maniac makes the police academy (1984 - 1994) series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication! as for the horror aspect that too is lame .  it's also an incredibly slow (it takes over half an hour before dornwinkles even becomes invisible) ,  dull ,  predictable ,  boring & has highly annoying & unlikable teenage character's . <br /><br />director rifkin or coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try & make the invisible maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience .  there's no NOT_scares ,  tension or atmosphere & as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through .  he does nothing with the invisibility angle ,  just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets .  there is very little gore or violence ,  a bit of splashing blood ,  a few strangulations & the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun ,  unfortunately he was invisible at the time & we only get to see the headless torso afterwards . <br /><br />the budget must have been low ,  & i mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film .  dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet! when he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him & the entire school has about a dozen pupils & two teachers .  the invisible maniac is a poorly made film throughout it's 85 minute duration ,  i spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion .  .  .  lets just say the acting is of a low standard & leave it at that . <br /><br />the invisible maniac is crap ,  plain & simple .  i found no NOT_redeeming NOT_features NOT_in NOT_it NOT_at NOT_all ,  there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no NOT_reason NOT_whatsoever NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_on NOT_this NOT_rubbish .  definitely one to avoid . 
1891 1 this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine .  the immortal charles dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine .  i admit i have not NOT_seen NOT_the NOT_classic NOT_alistair NOT_sim NOT_version NOT_and NOT_i'm NOT_sure NOT_someday NOT_i NOT_will NOT_but NOT_i NOT_would NOT_be NOT_blown NOT_away NOT_if NOT_it NOT_touched NOT_even NOT_close NOT_to NOT_this NOT_amazing NOT_eighties NOT_version .  i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it . <br /><br />the story is well known ,  i won't NOT_go NOT_into NOT_much NOT_detail NOT_because NOT_everyone NOT_has NOT_seen NOT_it NOT_in NOT_one NOT_form NOT_or NOT_another .  a rich ,  stingy ,  mean ,  old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways .  in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits ,  each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with ,  past ,  present and future .  finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done . <br /><br />george c .  scott is absolutely ,  undeniably perfect for this role .  he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character .  he is not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_mean NOT_old NOT_man ,  but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world .  there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved .  scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge . <br /><br />not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place .  this is a grand epic of victorian england ,  dickens england is recreated before our very eyes ,  the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market .  director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination .  i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery .  it's not NOT_spectacular NOT_scenery NOT_per NOT_se NOT_but NOT_it's NOT_real .  the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between . <br /><br />the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life .  bob cratchitt ,  played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful .  the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story .  a christmas carol is not NOT_a NOT_light NOT_story .  dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england's life and it's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark ,  almost scary ,  and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around .  the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles .  the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the christmas music ,  everything fits together .  apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others .  10/10 
1892 0 why is this show so popular? it's beyond me why people like it .  i think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there .  <br /><br />because it's so popular ,  i've tried more than once to watch it and i can't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_through NOT_an NOT_entire NOT_episode . <br /><br />for one thing ,  the acting is horrible .  everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch .  they talk in unnatural voices ,  use unnatural tones ,  and have unnatural body language .  i've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play . <br /><br />for another thing ,  it's not NOT_funny .  the plots are dull .  they're not NOT_creative ,  intelligent ,  or funny .  shouldn't a sitcom be funny?? why am i not NOT_laughing?<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>lastly ,  what is seventies about this? it's about as authentic to the seventies as "happy days" was to the fifties . <br /><br />oh and what is up with ashton kutcher? who cast this untalented dweeb? and now he's making movies?? oh ,  save us all!<br /><br />if people think this is quality television ,  it worries me . 
1893 1 as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years ,  whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions ,  it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other .  that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge ,  merchant and money lender in 19th century london . <br /><br />as his nephew points out to his uncle ,  he doesn't NOT_keep NOT_christmas NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way NOT_because NOT_scrooge NOT_feels NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing NOT_is NOT_humbug .  the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago ,  he's a hard case ,  a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart ,  mr .  potter of bedford falls ,  new york . <br /><br />but as charles dickens told this tale ,  redemption is not NOT_too NOT_late NOT_for NOT_any NOT_of NOT_us NOT_and NOT_a NOT_lonely NOT_ghost NOT_and NOT_three NOT_spirits NOT_visit NOT_scrooge NOT_and NOT_show NOT_him NOT_how . <br /><br />a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was .  the characters in this film are middle and lower class .  the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist ,  but they are having to struggle to stay up there .  still love and happiness radiate their home ,  no NOT_thanks NOT_to NOT_the NOT_guy NOT_bob NOT_cratchit NOT_works NOT_for .  <br /><br />like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ,  ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world . <br /><br />patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge .  but george c .  scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film .  the meanness of him ,  but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change .  scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who've both done great interpretations of scrooge . <br /><br />among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present .  <br /><br />according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best . 
1894 0 as someone who lived through , and still remembers that decade vividly , if the actual '70s had been half this funny and (semi)normal , they would have been so much more enjoyable . actual kids in that era did not NOT_act NOT_or NOT_behave NOT_anything NOT_close NOT_to NOT_as NOT_bright-eyed NOT_and NOT_normal NOT_as NOT_these NOT_kids NOT_did . the country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it spawned , especially in the behavior department;the petulance , the smugness , the self-righteousness , the childishness , the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that . <br /><br />someone compared to "happy days" , and i can see why:they were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast , and they both offer only surface  , cliched depictions of the actual eras , not NOT_even NOT_close NOT_to NOT_the NOT_full NOT_scope NOT_of NOT_it , just showing the obvious things - the fashions , toys , music , contraptions , etc , and that's it . for those too young to remember , or weren't NOT_born NOT_then , trust me , the '70s weren't NOT_like NOT_that , any more than "happy days" were like the actual '50s , as "m*a*s*h*" didn't NOT_accurately NOT_portray NOT_life NOT_at NOT_a NOT_us NOT_army NOT_medical NOT_base NOT_during NOT_the NOT_korean NOT_war , etc . 
1895 1 and possibly closest to the dickens story line .  although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch (who's idea was that period hair ,  surely they could have done better than that!) ,  scott does an incredible job as scrooge .  his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me .  edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present .  i find g . c .  scott's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart .  the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn't 'missed it' ,  is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact .  he's phenomenal here .  nearly the entire cast is incredible .  the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at ,  almost too sweet .  still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday .  enjoy! 
1896 0 i've tried to watch this show several times ,  but for a show called "that '70s show , " i don't NOT_find NOT_much NOT_apart NOT_from NOT_a NOT_few NOT_haircuts NOT_and NOT_the NOT_occasional NOT_reference NOT_to NOT_disco NOT_that NOT_actually NOT_evokes NOT_the NOT_'70s NOT_-- NOT_the NOT_decade NOT_in NOT_which NOT_i NOT_grew NOT_up .  of the episodes i have seen ,  most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period .  take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '70s ,  and the show is neither interesting nor funny . <br /><br />if you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the '70s ,  in my humble opinion you can do no NOT_better NOT_than NOT_"the NOT_wonder NOT_years . " 
1897 1 this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken's classic tale .  the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens ,  and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere .  viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice . <br /><br />george c .  scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge ,  and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts .  i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser ,  something rarely done in other versions .  the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production ,  which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen . 
1898 0 i have never NOT_understood NOT_the NOT_appeal NOT_of NOT_this NOT_show .  the acting is poor (debra jo rupp being a notable exception) ,  the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring ,  the dialogue is weak ,  the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode .  furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny ,  clichã©d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that .  both "happy days" and "the wonder years" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible ,  pathetic excuse for a show 
1899 1 "telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule ,  which is why this film always tends to buck the trend . <br /><br />george c .  scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly ,  fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies ,  and still makes him a simpathetic character .  the production value for this film was exceptional ,  never NOT_relying NOT_on NOT_boffo NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_or NOT_soundstage NOT_set-ups ,  yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops .  a movie that certainly stands alone . 
1900 0 i caught this film on azn on cable .  it sounded like it would be a good film ,  a japanese "green card" .  i can't NOT_say NOT_i've NOT_ever NOT_disliked NOT_an NOT_asian NOT_film ,  quite the contrary .  some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean ,  and i am a huge fan of john woo's hong kong films .  i an not NOT_adverse NOT_to NOT_a NOT_light NOT_hearted NOT_films ,  like tampopo or chung king express (two of my favourites) ,  so i thought i would like this .  well ,  i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious ,  badly acted film ever again . <br /><br />i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude ,  because no NOT_one NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_had NOT_a NOT_personality .  and when any of the characters did try to act ,  as opposed to mumbling a line or two ,  their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake .  i honestly did not NOT_think NOT_that NOT_anyone NOT_had NOT_ever NOT_acted NOT_before .  .  . the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki .  .  i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy ,  because i didn't NOT_laugh NOT_once .  even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this "a refreshing breath of comedy" .  it was neither refreshing ,  nor a breath of comedy .  and the ending was very predictable ,  the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things . <br /><br />avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting .  i actually think that "spike of bensonhurst" is a better acted film than this .  .  . and i walked out half way through that film! 
1901 1 the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens' classic tale .  george c .  scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast .  his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie .  then his character changes to one who is truly repentant .  the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film .  it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a wonderful life . 
1902 0 *** may contain spoilers .  *** <br /><br />if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment where real-life wanna-be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety ,  anti-depression ,  and anti-psychotic medications (this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies) all during filming ,  then this movie would hold far more interest .  or ,  if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming ,  then tokyo time could be more easily explained . <br /><br />as it is ,  this film is filled with lifeless ,  low-energy actors .  in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister ,  it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open .  in almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless .  from beginning to end ,  his facial expression is best described as "near sleep .

1903 1 i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens' story ,  but for me ,  this 1984 version is the one to beat .  my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs ,  and we watch it together every christmas eve .  i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too ,  because it's a very creepy ghost story . <br /><br />scott--typecast as scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty ,  making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving .  i think it's up there with his performance in patton .  the spirits are all effective ,  each one creepier than the last .  watching the dark ,  floating ,  skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year .  and what a supporting cast! david warner ,  in particular ,  is in top form as bob cratchit ,  as is susannah york as his wife .  <br /><br />i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but i may be mistaken ,  as it's been several years since i read it .  regardless ,  this is a terrific christmas classic . 
1904 0 happy go lovely is a waste of everybody's time and talent including the audience .  the lightness of the old-hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable .  very few people watched these movies for their plots .  but ,  they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not NOT_here .  they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs .  not NOT_happy NOT_go NOT_lovely .  and vera-ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie ,  and couldn't do it .  the scottish locale was wasted .  usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent .  the photography was pedestrian .  the musical numbers were pedestrian .  cesar romero gives his usual professional performance ,  chewing up the scenery since no NOT_one NOT_else NOT_was NOT_doing NOT_his NOT_part ,  in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou .  david niven is just fine ,  and no NOT_one NOT_could NOT_do NOT_david NOT_niven NOT_like NOT_david NOT_niven .  at the end of the day ,  if you adore niven as i do ,  it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely .  if not ,  skip it . 
1905 1 so this made for tv film scores only a 7 . 6 on this site? bah! humbug! without question this 1984 version of dickens' classic tale is the best ever made .  and yes ,  the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good ,  but not NOT_good NOT_enough .  the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version ,  although the acting was wonderful . <br /><br />george c .  scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge .  we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner ,  then by three other spirits later on that evening .  scott is properly gruff as scrooge .  too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new-found glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson .  but hey ,  this is george c .  scott .  he's never NOT_going NOT_to NOT_go NOT_dancing NOT_down NOT_the NOT_street NOT_in NOT_a NOT_fit NOT_of NOT_joy .  he has too much dignity ,  and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner . <br /><br />the supporting performances are uniformly excellent ,  as are the costumes ,  music ,  and scenery .  19th century london comes to life in clive donner's visionary style .  the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits .  the important tale of morality shines through in every frame ,  though . <br /><br />you won't NOT_often NOT_find NOT_this NOT_version NOT_aired NOT_on NOT_television NOT_anymore ,  and that is a disappointment .  the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday .  when the decorations come out of the basement ,  this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season . <br /><br />10 of 10 stars . <br /><br />the hound . 
1906 0 "happy go lovely" has only two things going for it .  and those two things are vera-ellen's legs .  this is a british (excelsior films) version of an m-g-m musical complete with second tier stars .  i would imagine that vera-ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star .  but ,  i'm sorry to say ,  ms .  ellen's chance did not NOT_pay NOT_off . <br /><br />opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune ,  this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy .  the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin ,  and with the exception of david niven ,  cesar romero (who is way over the top in his role of a producer) and bobby howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable . <br /><br />the choreography is boring ,  but ms .  ellen gives it her all .  she was never NOT_as NOT_famous NOT_as NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_musical NOT_stars(and NOT_she NOT_shouldn't NOT_be NOT_since NOT_she NOT_couldn't NOT_sing NOT_and NOT_even NOT_had NOT_a NOT_"dancing NOT_stand NOT_in" NOT_in NOT_several NOT_of NOT_her NOT_pictures" .  but when she did dance ,  it was just entrancing . <br /><br />it's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not NOT_give NOT_her NOT_the NOT_tools NOT_she NOT_needed NOT_to NOT_shine . <br /><br />4 out of 10 
1907 1 far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's .  george c .  scott was born to be scrooge ,  just as he was born to be patton .  mr .  scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century .  the character of scrooge as played by mr .  scott seemed to jump off the screen .  scott as scrooge brought an richer ,  more robust ,  yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london .  mr .  scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal ,  understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper ,  almost as a soliloquy ,  as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath ,  yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line .  he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge ,  and a misunderstood ,  sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene . <br /><br />truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation . 
1908 0 the oddly-named vera-ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice-skating: blonde ,  girlish ,  always delightful to watch ,  but not NOT_an NOT_especially NOT_good NOT_actress NOT_and NOT_usually NOT_lumbered NOT_with NOT_weak NOT_material .  when i watch vera-ellen's sexy apache dance with gene kelly in 'words and music' ,  i can't NOT_help NOT_noticing NOT_that NOT_her NOT_blouse NOT_(yellow NOT_with NOT_narrow NOT_red NOT_horizontal NOT_stripes) NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be NOT_made NOT_out NOT_of NOT_the NOT_south NOT_vietnam NOT_flag .  for some reason ,  the very american vera-ellen starred in *two* musicals (made several years apart) set in edinburgh ,  a city not NOT_noted NOT_for NOT_its NOT_tap-dancers: NOT_'let's NOT_be NOT_happy' NOT_and NOT_'happy NOT_go NOT_lovely' . <br /><br />in the latter ,  cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh .  there's a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival ,  which is nonsense: the festival is not NOT_a NOT_showcase NOT_for NOT_splashy NOT_leg-shows .  we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile: apart from a few highland accents ,  there's absolutely no NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_convey NOT_scottish NOT_atmosphere NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie .  the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning ,  when we learn that the title of romero's show is 'frolics to you': this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks won't . <br /><br />vera-ellen is ,  as usual ,  cute and appealing and an impressive dancer ,  but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad .  the plot -- mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson -- is brainless ,  though no NOT_more NOT_so NOT_than NOT_the NOT_plots NOT_of NOT_several NOT_dozen NOT_hollywood NOT_musicals .  romero is less annoying than usual here ,  probably because (for once) he isn't NOT_required NOT_to NOT_convince NOT_us NOT_that NOT_he's NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_bedding NOT_the NOT_heroine . <br /><br />the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes .  the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals; his wistful rendition of "she's my lovely" was a big hit in britain in 1937 .  here ,  he shows up in several scenes as romero's dogsbody but never NOT_has NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_participate NOT_in NOT_a NOT_musical NOT_number ,  nor even any real comedy .  it's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word 'lovely' ,  sure to evoke howes's greatest hit -- would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do!<br /><br />the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts (whom i worked with once) shines in one restaurant sequence ,  and there's a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall .  as vera-ellen's confidante ,  somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i've ever heard: it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go ,  but doesn't NOT_match NOT_either .  val guest has a story credit ,  but this movie doesn't NOT_come NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_quality NOT_of NOT_his NOT_brilliant NOT_comedies .  the colour photography is wretched ,  though i realise that postwar britain could not NOT_afford NOT_hollywood's NOT_process NOT_work .  'happy go lovely' is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster ,  with 'waster' being the operative word .  i'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 . 
1909 1 this 1984 version of the dickens' classic `a christmas carol , ' directed by clive donner ,  stars george c .  scott as ebenezer scrooge .  by this time around ,  the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and ,  happily to say ,  with this film donner not NOT_only NOT_met NOT_the NOT_challenge NOT_but NOT_surpassed NOT_any NOT_expectations NOT_anyone NOT_might NOT_have NOT_had NOT_for NOT_it .  he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail ,  and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative ,  especially scott .  one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction ,  ever-- was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film; but i think with his performance here ,  scott has now achieved that distinction .  there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen scott do it; simply put ,  he is scrooge .  and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous .  it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well ,  to be able to make a character so real ,  from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face ,  and to make it all ring so true .  it's a study in perfection . <br /><br />the other members of the cast are splendid as well ,  but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott's performance; and they do .  frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley; a notable turn ,  though not NOT_as NOT_memorable ,  perhaps ,  as the one by alec guinness (as marley) in the film ,  `scrooge . ' angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past; edward woodward ,  grand and boisterous ,  and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present; and michael carter ,  grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come . <br /><br />david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit ,  bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott's scrooge ,  and susannah york fares just as well as mrs .  cratchit .  the real gem to be found here ,  though ,  is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin ,  and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film . <br /><br />the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees (fred holywell ,  and also the narrator of the film) ,  caroline langrishe (janet holywell) ,  lucy gutteridge (belle) ,  michael gough (mr .  poole) and joanne whalley (fan) .  a flawless presentation ,  this version of `a christmas carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_many NOT_versions NOT_you NOT_may NOT_have NOT_seen ,  watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever .  and forever after ,  whenever you think of scrooge ,  the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c .  scott .  a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience ,  this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home .  i rate this one 10/10 . 
1910 0 i don't NOT_think NOT_any NOT_player NOT_in NOT_hollywood NOT_history NOT_lasted NOT_as NOT_long NOT_as NOT_david NOT_niven NOT_did NOT_given NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_weak NOT_films NOT_he NOT_had NOT_to NOT_carry NOT_by NOT_dint NOT_of NOT_his NOT_incredible NOT_charm .  he could act ,  got an oscar for it ,  but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper . <br /><br />happy go lovely is a case in point .  it's a musical and for the most part you'll remember vera-ellen's dancing .  you'll remember that they are in scot's costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival .  but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory . <br /><br />the plot is light .  vera-ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh .  she starts in the chorus and runs late one day .  she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king .  everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire .  doors open up as they've never NOT_opened NOT_before . <br /><br />the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake .  cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical . <br /><br />in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of . 
1911 1 this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit .  she brings her way of dealing with the law ,  which means more than simple convictions .  the strong performance of the main character ,  supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable . 
1912 0 it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all .  it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen . <br /><br />not only have i ever been this bored before (luckily not NOT_for NOT_more NOT_then NOT_1 , 5 hours) ,  the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not NOT_even NOT_close NOT_to NOT_getting NOT_but NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_corners NOT_of NOT_my NOT_mouth NOT_slightly NOT_tilted .  after the first very awkward part ,  you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better .  you hope in vain ,  it only goes downhill from there . <br /><br />the movie has no NOT_story NOT_worth NOT_telling NOT_whatsoever NOT_and NOT_repeats NOT_this NOT_non-story NOT_three NOT_times .  one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never NOT_lays NOT_his NOT_hands NOT_on NOT_a NOT_camera NOT_again .  .  . 
1913 1 the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film ,  and also relates to the dogma films . <br /><br />did you ever get bored of those hollywood-style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of? fed up with the married-living-single cop ,  the divorced-but-family-man ,  the personified doughnut and the tough hunter? ever wondered how the real police work is like?<br /><br />well ,  for germany ,  this film shows you .  set in the north between west germany and east germany ,  former ddr ,  an laid off post office clerk starts her job ,  fresh from policeschool .  she quickly finds her way around the usual customers ,  and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman .  .  .  but this is not NOT_much NOT_fun . <br /><br />other german crime films like derrick ,  der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects .  these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder .  good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view ,  even more if you know that part of germany a bit . 
1914 0 so ,  i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris ,  who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u .  i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film .  .  . <br /><br />the documentary section at the beginning dragged on .  yes ,  the kid is a nut-job from no NOT_where ,  but that's not NOT_good NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_it NOT_interesting . <br /><br />seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight .  .  .  and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor . <br /><br />when crispin glover takes on larry ,  the story-telling was better ,  but i just couldn't take anymore .  .  . 
1915 1 i would never NOT_have NOT_thought NOT_that NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be NOT_possible NOT_to NOT_make NOT_such NOT_an NOT_impressive NOT_movie NOT_without NOT_any NOT_music .  but it is .  just the pictures .  watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul .  really strong .  might make you feel different . 
1916 0 how did this become a blockbuster? dear god i don't NOT_know NOT_where NOT_to NOT_start NOT_why NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_sucked NOT_too NOT_much .  the movie was predictable & there was no NOT_originality .  the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters .  the movie was too bright ,  they should have done something with the lighting ,  eg .  making the environment more darker .  the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick .  this is 2006! people don't NOT_get NOT_scared NOT_by NOT_other NOT_people NOT_wearing NOT_heavy NOT_make NOT_up .  most of the horror scenes we're taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies .  total rip off! this is why i don't NOT_watch NOT_tagalog NOT_movies .  the only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of conformity .  how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv ,  its now coming from the window next door? no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_you NOT_put NOT_it ,  its still a rip off .  if you want a good horror movie ,  go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website . 
1917 1 wow! i have seen so many bad low budget films lately ,  but this one is great .  the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series .  i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clichã© about the police .  this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time .  a perfect tradeoff! 
1918 0 i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't NOT_for NOT_ms .  claudine barretto's performance .  and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino's here .  and .  .  .  end . <br /><br />i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't NOT_give NOT_enough NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_(and NOT_their NOT_progression) NOT_in NOT_their NOT_stories NOT_(redundant??) .  it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank .  and my goodness ,  creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies .  why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't NOT_give NOT_it NOT_that NOT_much NOT_merit .  the movie was kind of scary ,  but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore .  .  .  it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category .  i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences ,  never NOT_mind NOT_if NOT_the NOT_lighting NOT_sucked ,  it wouldn't NOT_matter NOT_much NOT_if NOT_the NOT_content NOT_would NOT_blow NOT_you NOT_away .  .  sayang . 
1919 1 there are many police dramas doing the rounds .  i am not NOT_sure NOT_why .  it's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil . <br /><br />this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne ,  a raw recruit ,  into a police squad stationed in the baltic area .  no NOT_attempt NOT_is NOT_made NOT_to NOT_glamorise NOT_the NOT_police .  they are truly down to earth ,  harsh at times and unforgiving ,  anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition .  against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations . <br /><br />this is not NOT_a NOT_pleasant NOT_film .  not NOT_one NOT_to NOT_relax NOT_you .  there is not NOT_much NOT_feeling NOT_of NOT_optimism NOT_in NOT_it .  the police seem to be involved in a losing battle .  tomorrow there will be more bashings ,  more murders ,  more family break-ups ,  and more distressed children .  let's face it .  this is the world we live in . <br /><br />as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating .  the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny ,  a 12 year old from a broken family .  anne has her own way of patching things up .  she turns a blind eye to benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can .  i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny's father .  it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs .  after all ,  the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children . <br /><br />well cast but not NOT_my NOT_idea NOT_of NOT_an NOT_evening's NOT_entertainment , 
1920 0 oh dear .  i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japan's ringu .  well ,  i guess the u . s .  made their version of it as well ,  but at least it was an outright remake .  so ,  so sad .  i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country ,  so i can't NOT_believe NOT_this NOT_had NOT_to NOT_happen .  claudine and kris are such big names there ,  surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism .  to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not NOT_have NOT_to NOT_stoop NOT_this NOT_low NOT_to NOT_make NOT_money .  there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them! 
1921 1 this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand .  even well translated ,  there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism .  my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort ,  but that just got wasted on me . <br /><br />what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects .  some kid becomes "the one" and in the end has almost no NOT_relevance NOT_to NOT_a NOT_yokai NOT_war NOT_that NOT_makes NOT_no NOT_sense NOT_whatsoever NOT_anyway .  it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about ,  but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (rihanna eat your heart out!) i couldn't really discern the plot . <br /><br />bottom line: nice visuals ,  the kid screams a lot ,  the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap .

1923 1 the only reason i'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi's tormentors were not NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_job .  i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy ,  but they were not NOT_well NOT_coached ,  and their scenes were a minor annoyance .  <br /><br />i say not NOT_to NOT_judge NOT_this NOT_by NOT_u . s .  standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces ,  and is not NOT_beholden NOT_to NOT_the NOT_black-hat/ NOT_white-hat NOT_moral NOT_constraints NOT_u . s .  kids' films are routinely subjected to .  for example ,  there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai ,  and shojo--the avuncular kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out japanese adult would do .  hint: this would not NOT_happen NOT_in NOT_a NOT_disney NOT_film .  this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie .  <br /><br />early on ,  there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book .  there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out .  it was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room .  his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up .  then ,  someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune ,  but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead .  i mention this commercial ,  because it was considered funny ,  and i didn't NOT_hear NOT_any NOT_objections NOT_to NOT_it NOT_while NOT_i NOT_was NOT_there .  there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in "the great yokai war" than one would find in a disney movie .  as a parent ,  if this were a u . s .  film ,  i would be up in arms about such things ,  although not NOT_necessarily NOT_the NOT_moral NOT_lessons NOT_drawn NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_picture ,  which ,  of course ,  are also not NOT_black NOT_and NOT_white .  since it's a japanese movie ,  i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not NOT_get NOT_past NOT_the NOT_standards NOT_and NOT_practices NOT_cops NOT_in NOT_a NOT_u . s .  production .  however ,  i'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff ,  or i'd wait till they're older to show it to them . 
1924 0 chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick ,  the film is so annoying .  .  .  .  . unless you believe in psychics ,  re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time .  the "re-cycling of souls , " they call it here .  puh-leeze . <br /><br />this story has been done several times before with such films as "heaven can wait . " it's also been done a lot better .  too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr .  ,  cybill shepherd ,  ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson . <br /><br />at least it's a pretty tame film ,  language-wise .  that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie . 
1925 1 i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressed . everything about it was superb .  the acting the characters ,  the story .  a believable child who grew into brave ,  always willing to help others .  his mum must be proud .  i could not NOT_take NOT_my NOT_eyes NOT_off NOT_this NOT_film NOT_for NOT_fear NOT_of NOT_missing NOT_something .  it is the prefect fable/tale with morals ,  cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk .  a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero .  picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai ,  who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of .  and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug .  these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects ,  like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill .  takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour ,  alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that ,  if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores .  the lines are good especially the don't NOT_try NOT_this NOT_at NOT_home NOT_kids NOT_and NOT_other NOT_gems NOT_that NOT_bring NOT_a NOT_smile NOT_to NOT_your NOT_lips .  suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy! though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad .  and not NOT_necessarily NOT_so .  cheers furdion 
1926 0 'chances are' a big mistake to see .  you could know director emile ardolino from 'dirty dancing' and 'sister act' and should expect something amusing from him .  but i guess i have to disillusion you .  he made a really ,  really bad movie . <br /><br />according to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby .  the baby grows up robert downey jr ,  and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter ,  mary stuart masterson (complicated ,  huh?) . <br /><br />they fall in love with each other .  then appears jr former wife ,  cybill shepherd ,  and jr falls in love with her too .  i guess i don't NOT_even NOT_have NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_that NOT_she NOT_loves NOT_ryan NOT_o'neil . <br /><br />in one of his first roles robert downey jr's on his worst .  he copies michael j fox . <br /><br />after the 'moonlighting' shepherd proves that she's not NOT_suitable NOT_for NOT_acting NOT_in NOT_movies . <br /><br />anyway ,  there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia . 
1927 1 takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film ,  because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love: visitor q ,  gozu ,  izo ,  ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy .  lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding .  still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction ,  so i was nervous .  of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did . <br /><br />great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too .  the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child: neverending story ,  labyrinth ,  return to oz ,  etc .  i enjoyed those films because they didn't NOT_treat NOT_kids NOT_like NOT_they're NOT_stupid NOT_and NOT_this NOT_one NOT_doesn't NOT_either .  the dark underlying morals are there ,  but ,  it's also as silly as any kids film should be .  i personally wasn't NOT_bothered NOT_by NOT_the NOT_cgi NOT_and NOT_prosthetics .  i feel like they fit well and don't NOT_think NOT_kids NOT_will NOT_notice . <br /><br />if you are a die hard takashi miike fan ,  you may not NOT_like NOT_this NOT_one .  but ,  i suggest giving it a shot .  it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is .  he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones ,  which is very reassuring . <br /><br />to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one ,  i suggest these other miike films: 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china . ' <br /><br />good job takashi miike! 8/10 stars . 
1928 0 predictable plot .  simple dialogue .  shockingly unemotional performances .  but robert downey ,  jr .  is so cute ,  i gave this "poor man's afternoon special" a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved . 
1929 1 "yokai daisenso" is a children's film by takashi miike ,  but as you might expect ,  it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones .  however ,  older children may well eat this up ,  that is ,  if you play it dubbed in english . <br /><br />the story is that of a young boy ,  who has moved with his mother to the country ,  to live with his grandfather ,  after a divorce .  during a village festival the boy is chosen as a "kirin rider" ,  a great honor ,  but with that honor comes much danger and adventure ,  of course . <br /><br />meanwhile ,  evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt ,  go-go boots & a beehive hair-do ,  teams up with an evil yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them .  and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself ,  tokyo .  one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city .  .  . says one ,  "oh ,  it's only gamera" .  <br /><br />the young boy has befriended yokai ,  which are monsters of a kind ,  mostly benign ,  that have isolated themselves away from humans ,  and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil . <br /><br />in many ways miike & crew have taken the late 60's/early 70's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for (older) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "transformers" .  the look and feel of the film is great ,  the effects are entertaining ,  and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads ,  but still ,  older ones might enjoy it .  as for adults ,  there's not NOT_much NOT_here NOT_not NOT_to NOT_like ,  if you're a fan of japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this . <br /><br />cool & fun stuff ,  kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just miike .  . and what a wild ride .  8 out of 10 . 
1930 0 first i liked that movie .  it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments .  the costume designer albert wolsky did his best!!! the same as wonderful set decorator robert r .  benton - this man really had a very good taste!!! but the script writers disappointed me extremely .  the best ending would be the scene on the ladder ,  but instead of it ,  they decided that the father and his daughter should be together .  don't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_ending .  the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright .  it would be ok ,  if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body ,  but they did not ,  they only deprived him of memories .  the actors were good ,  they were really funny .  cybill shepherd was charming ,  robert downey jr .  was very funny in the dancing scene : ))) .  .  .  but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting .  for example ,  corinne jeffries ,  played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!) ,  she was true to him ,  she loved nobody but him ,  and when she met him and was just about making love to him ,  after a scene with her friend philip train (ryan o'neal) ,  she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!! it would be a good movie ,  if not NOT_the NOT_ending NOT_and NOT_some NOT_missed NOT_human NOT_psychology . 
1931 1 yokai monsters: spook warfare (yokai daisenso ,  2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional japanese "monsters" of folklore .  it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade . <br /><br />the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak ,  kappa water imp ,  a living 'brella ,  a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic ,  a woman with a second face on the back of her head ,  a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist ,  & so on . <br /><br />these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not NOT_only NOT_from NOT_fairy NOT_lore ,  but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era ,  comparable to today's halloween haunted houses ,  or the "freak shows" of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks .  ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create "chills" during the hot summers .  the fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions ,  based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky ,  this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills . <br /><br />these rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord .  despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy ,  & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak ,  it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming .  it has some beautiful cinematography ,  much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade .  viewed in the right mood or with the right friends ,  it is exciting ,  moving & touching . <br /><br />yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf & cub: white heaven & hell (1974) &and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy .  the yokai monsters series is not NOT_the NOT_equal NOT_of NOT_majin NOT_at NOT_its NOT_best ,  but the yokai are nevertheless great fun .  the first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films ,  with the gozu & izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers . 
1932 0 films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning .  while there are some exceptions ,  the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes .  the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds ,  as they're both very annoying and they don't NOT_have NOT_an NOT_ounce NOT_of NOT_acting NOT_ability NOT_between NOT_them .  in short; they're rubbish .  this isn't NOT_good NOT_considering NOT_that NOT_they're NOT_the NOT_leads ,  and it especially isn't NOT_good NOT_when NOT_you NOT_consider NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_it NOT_is NOT_virtually NOT_impossible NOT_to NOT_take NOT_this NOT_film NOT_seriously NOT_because NOT_of NOT_the NOT_rubbish NOT_actors .  it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't NOT_(not NOT_completely) .  it follows a young girl who ,  after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook ,  wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created .  it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings ,  and so sets about making various changes ,  until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare .  oh dear . <br /><br />as you can see ,  this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie .  however ,  it is squandered through a number of fatal faults .  first and foremost ,  in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale .  the central plot is hardly played with at all ,  and the result is an entirely boring experience .  the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie ,  as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't NOT_care NOT_any NOT_more NOT_(which NOT_is NOT_due NOT_to NOT_a NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_ideas) .  thanks in part to it's lead characters ,  the film feels like a kids movie throughout .  this is to be expected as it stars kids ,  but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best .  the film is also very cheesy ,  and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy ,  and makes for very painful viewing .  in fact ,  if i had to sum this travesty up in one word ,  i would choose 'painful' .  paperhouse is poorly acted ,  laughably plotted ,  very corny and dull on the whole .  save yourself the pain ,  see something else . 
1933 1 2005 toronto film festival report it is official; "takashi miike" is whacked . <br /><br />the annual midnight screening of the new "takashi miike" film ,  "the big spook war" or "the great yokai war" or "yã´kai daisensã´" .  call it what you will this is a fanatical ride . <br /><br />colin geddes ,  the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan .  think of "lord of the rings" or "neverending story" for japan .  after the screening i can understand where they were going with that ,  but damn this is "takashi miike" after all .  he directed the '01 film "ichi the killer" ,  when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening .  and no ,  that wasn't NOT_just NOT_a NOT_marketing NOT_ploy . <br /><br />plot summary: a young boy with a troubled home life becomes "chosen , " and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war ,  where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey . <br /><br />this is not NOT_really NOT_for NOT_kids ,  well not NOT_'too' NOT_young .  certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits (even the friendly ones) on display .  this is unlike anything i've seen in the movie theater before .  a fantasy naturally ,  some very funny (but dark) material .  you will not NOT_be NOT_bored NOT_can NOT_guarantee NOT_that .  will this ever hit north america? doubtful . <br /><br />my rating = b

1935 1 what a strangely wonderful ,  if sometimes slight and bulky ,  big-budget fantasy this is .  takashi miike had already proved ,  by the time he got to the great yokhai war ,  that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre (visitor q and andromedia showed this ,  the former great the latter lesser) .  but here miike ,  in his first and only co-screen writing credit no NOT_less ,  proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions ,  and with it boatload of cgi ,  creature-effects and make-up ,  and an epic battle that is more like a "festival" than something out of lord of the rings .  the comparisons can be made far and wide ,  to be sure ,  and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki ,  for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes ,  power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source ,  machinery as the greatest evil ,  and many bizarrely defined ,  flamboyantly designed creatures (or yokai of the title) .  but there can also be comparisons made to star wars ,  especially to the gungan battle in tpm ,  and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces .  or to anime like samurai 7 .  or ,  of course ,  to henson's films .  and through all of these comparisons ,  and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments ,  it's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters .  <br /><br />here ,  ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi ,  the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world ,  but will become the hero in a world going into darkness .  the darkness is from an evil sorcerer ,  who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world ,  and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures ,  the yokhai ,  into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths .  tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato's main minion and cohort ,  agi (kill bill's chiaki kuriyama ,  another great villainies) steals tadashi's little furry companion ,  a sunekosuri .  soon ,  things come to a head ,  in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories ,  but can only be contained ,  up to a point ,  by miike and his crew .  i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids ,  but in the forward note that it's not NOT_some NOT_watered NOT_down NOT_fantasy NOT_in NOT_american NOT_circles .  this has creatures galore ,  including a one-eyed umbrella stand ,  and a walking ,  talking wall ,  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_a NOT_turtle ,  a fire serpent ,  and a woman who became cursed by sato .  so the variety is on high on that end ,  and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the "festival" hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope .  but there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark ,  and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike's disposal (and not NOT_just NOT_because NOT_it's NOT_cuteness NOT_squared); NOT_where NOT_else NOT_to NOT_get NOT_an NOT_audience NOT_riled NOT_up NOT_than NOT_over NOT_a NOT_little NOT_furry NOT_ball NOT_of NOT_fury ,  who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form? <br /><br />yet through all of this ,  the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike's career is here as well ,  which distinguishes it from its animated ,  muppet and sci-fi counterparts .  there's the bizarre humor as usual ,  including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax ,  and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (i loved ,  for example ,  the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller ,  or the anxious turtle-yokai) .  the biggest danger with miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry ,  which he flirts with ,  is overkill on this end .  he's got everything down ,  i'm sure ,  with storyboards ,  and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done ,  and tadashi and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot) ,  but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots ,  and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant ,  and some visuals ,  like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map ,  just seem weak and pat .  i almost wondered if miike might dip into (bad) spy kids territory ,  quite frankly . <br /><br />but this liability aside ,  the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement ,  goofy thrills ,  and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies .  it owes a lot to cinema ,  as well as traditional japanese folklore ,  but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats .  it's not NOT_the NOT_filmmaker NOT_at NOT_his NOT_very NOT_best ,  but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage .  it's got a neat little message ,  and lots of cool adventure .  7 . 5/10 
1936 0 an intriguing premise of hand-drawn fantasy come to life in a child's fever dreams .  however ,  i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer .  the duel between anna's two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest ,  especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i've ever seen . <br /><br />use only for kindling . 
1937 1 a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a "children's film" ,  and that it certainly is ,  though it is one made for adults .  takashi miike uses the fantasy genre ,  particularly ,  the children's fantasy genre ,  as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war . <br /><br />the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the "hero" in this years annual festival ,  only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined .  what follows is a hallucinatory ,  grotesque ,  whimsical ,  and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore ,  but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world .  however ,  the villain here ,  is not NOT_a NOT_mere NOT_demon ,  it is the demon-spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans "use" and "discard" .  usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment ,  the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals(those whove played the video game ,  sonic the hedghog ,  might remember a certain dr .  robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then "liberate") . <br /><br />the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character ,  essentially playing the straight man ,  in a world gone suddenly mad .  though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not NOT_cowers ,  as do many of the yokia themselves ,  who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots ,  some spirits being umbrellas with eyes ,  talking walls ,  or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans .  .  . of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them . <br /><br />in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy ,  as few ,  if any ,  of the characters are heroic ,  their victory being a combination of happenstance ,  almost arbitrary faith ,  and a desire to party .  the yokai spirits ,  only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout ,  after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival ,  and even then only to dance and party .  also the film ends not NOT_with NOT_the NOT_usual NOT_celebratory NOT_all's NOT_well NOT_that NOT_ends NOT_well NOT_fantasy NOT_ending ,  but with a final scene ,  showing our hero years older ,  with an adult job ,  now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth ,  who then despondently turn to the villain ,  who being a spirit can never NOT_really NOT_die .  this ending ,  with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu ,  warns us not NOT_just NOT_of NOT_leaving NOT_behind NOT_our NOT_childhood NOT_selves ,  but of the horrors of over-consumption .  the villain is resentment caused when humans no NOT_longer NOT_have NOT_reverence NOT_for NOT_the NOT_world NOT_and NOT_the NOT_objects NOT_around NOT_them(in NOT_japanese NOT_folklore NOT_nearly NOT_every NOT_object NOT_has NOT_some NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_spirit) ,  and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence ,  they become soulless vengeful machines ,  not NOT_unlike NOT_those NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_modern NOT_video NOT_games ,  suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not NOT_ever NOT_really NOT_die ,  but can become deformed . <br /><br />this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to ,  and i believe it shows ,  as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness .  though i've focused mostly on the story (since lots of users here seem to write it off) ,  i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi ,  stop animation ,  costume ,  and live puppetry ,  that works remarkably well .  there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film ,  and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted ,  as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons ,  though this film is sharper and more adult than either .  the yokai are beaten ,  brutalized ,  and turned into machines of living hate ,  who i believe even kill a few humans ,  a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening ,  while a sexual undercurrent ,  the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero ,  or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy ,  seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes ,  especially when considering this is a "children's film" .  however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough ,  not NOT_to NOT_traumatize NOT_any NOT_children NOT_to NOT_bad .  grims fairy tales ,  before revisions ,  did much worse ,  far more often . <br /><br />all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet ,  with enough visual drama and great performances(the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them ,  thats laugh out loud funny at times) to appeal to audiences of all ages ,  and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth .  the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not NOT_just NOT_continue NOT_passive NOT_consumption NOT_of NOT_the NOT_world NOT_around NOT_them ,  but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood .  another beautiful ,  funny ,  and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex .  instant classic . 
1938 0 i was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's tv series "escape into night" which ,  though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd ,  fascinating and disturbing .  the acting in "paperhouse" is wooden ,  unintentionally a joke .  the overdubs didn't NOT_add NOT_tension NOT_they NOT_only NOT_reinforced NOT_that NOT_i NOT_was NOT_sat NOT_watching NOT_a NOT_botch .  casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth ,  chemistry or conviction .  as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted ,  consoled and reassured that they will not NOT_be NOT_held NOT_responsible .  out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen  .  .  .  lamer than i could have dreamt . <br /><br />"escape into night" deserves a proper remake ,  written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind . 
1939 1 miike makes a children's adventure film ,  not NOT_unlike NOT_the NOT_neverending NOT_story .  it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films .  even the worst miike is better than a good many films ,  though ,  and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending .  it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks .  i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the dvd includes an english dub) ,  but ,  like all of miike's films ,  it can tend to move very slowly .  that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness ,  where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse .  the story itself isn't NOT_very NOT_good ,  either ,  and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head .  most of what i liked came from the technical side of things .  this has to be miike's most expensive movie ,  and it looks fantastic .  "yokai" are japanese spirits ,  and they come in all different ,  fantastical forms ,  and the costume designers ,  special effects crew ,  and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job .  i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on (yokai monsters: spook warfare) ,  and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects .  i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls ,  in this case) ,  agi ,  who sports dark eye shadow ,  a tight ,  white outfit ,  a white beehive hairdo and a whip .  she's played ,  incidentally ,  by chiaki kuriyama ,  whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill: vol .  1 .  the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki ,  who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle . 
1940 0 normally i'm not NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_to NOT_be NOT_scared NOT_by NOT_horror NOT_movies ,  but this movie is the exception .  some how this movie got into my mind!!! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective ,  it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments ,  the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout .  another seen was the family photo i wasn't NOT_expecting NOT_that NOT_and NOT_i NOT_jumped NOT_out NOT_my NOT_seat!!! NOT_i NOT_would NOT_recommend NOT_everyone NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie ,  with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time!!!!! 
1941 1 now ,  i have seen a lot of movies in my day ,  but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me .  and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience .  this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies .  almost all the acting is believable ,  the graphics are decent (for which you won't NOT_even NOT_be NOT_caring NOT_about NOT_as NOT_you NOT_watch NOT_the NOT_movie .  trust me ,  bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do) ,  the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_kids . <br /><br />here's basically what this movie made me to .  it one ,  made me laugh .  .  . a lot ,  two ,  made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to ,  and three ,  it's a very uplifting story .  by the end of this movie you will feel good .  sure ,  what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil .  it's a formula that is used a lot .  but ,  in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago ,  the appearance of it is not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_judged .  it's very touching ,  the ending is original ,  and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to .  if you however try comparing this to other movies like "the never-ending story" or whatever it will diverse your opinion .  watch it as it is and you will enjoy it . <br /><br />it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this .  the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out .  there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it .  so don't NOT_over-analyze NOT_or NOT_take NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_too NOT_seriously ,  just enjoy it . 
1942 0 after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review .  this is my first ever so bare with me . <br /><br />first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no NOT_way NOT_is NOT_it NOT_horrific NOT_or NOT_scary NOT_in NOT_the NOT_slightest NOT_(with NOT_the NOT_exception NOT_of NOT_a NOT_few NOT_feeble NOT_attempts NOT_to NOT_make NOT_you NOT_jump NOT_unfortunately NOT_one NOT_of NOT_which NOT_worked NOT_on NOT_me . ) i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn't NOT_particularly NOT_thrilled NOT_either! NOT_the NOT_film NOT_is NOT_about NOT_a NOT_spoiled NOT_mischievous NOT_girl NOT_who NOT_faints NOT_a NOT_few NOT_times .  during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing ,  after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality .  as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in .  until she adds her constantly away father to the house ,  due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches . <br /><br />think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach . <br /><br />in conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab! 
1943 1 this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film ,  the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero .  however ,  due to far superior modern technology ,  puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope . <br /><br />i enjoyed this film ,  but boy was it a chore at first! unfortunately ,  for most westerners ,  this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd .  however ,  give it a chance .  don't NOT_think NOT_or NOT_try NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_everything NOT_you NOT_see--just NOT_allow NOT_the NOT_story NOT_to NOT_unfold NOT_and NOT_you NOT_will NOT_most NOT_likely NOT_enjoy NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />in many ways ,  this is exactly the sort of advice i'd give to adults who watch miyazaki's spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai (japanese mythical spirits) .  the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live-action and spirited away is much more child-friendly .  while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids' movie ,  in the usa ,  most parents would not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_show NOT_this NOT_to NOT_younger NOT_kids NOT_because NOT_it's NOT_so NOT_violent ,  scary and features some adult behaviors .  so who is the audience in the west? well ,  older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-western themes and composition .  this is a rather narrow audience ,  indeed! <br /><br />while you are watching ,  look for all the strange little touches .  in fact ,  you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time .  a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera ,  the scene that came with the comment "kids: don't NOT_try NOT_this NOT_at NOT_home" NOT_as NOT_well NOT_as NOT_the NOT_use NOT_of NOT_kirin NOT_beer NOT_to NOT_allow NOT_a NOT_person NOT_to NOT_actually NOT_see NOT_the NOT_yokai NOT_(hmm ,  .  .  . perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)! <br /><br />by the way ,  director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically ,  other than to say that none of his stories i've seen have seemed "normal" .  some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them (especially audition and ichi the killer)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i've ever seen (the happiness of the katakuris) .  one thing for sure ,  it's hard to watch one of his films and not NOT_have NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_reaction NOT_one NOT_way NOT_or NOT_the NOT_other . 
1944 0 this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares .  for a horror or "thriller" film and hype ,  it's way too tame .  there are only a few tense moments in here ,  not NOT_anywhere NOT_as NOT_near NOT_as NOT_many NOT_as NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_for NOT_a NOT_film NOT_of NOT_this NOT_genre .  even those "tense" scenes weren't NOT_much .  the music made them more dramatic that they actually were . <br /><br />there is a lot of symbolism in here ,  so the elitist critics label this "a thinking person's horror film . " well ,  if they think about it ,  i'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did - a waste of money at the video rental store . <br /><br />summary: a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting .  vastly overrated and certainly not NOT_what NOT_it NOT_is NOT_advertised . 
1945 1 wow! so much fun! probably a bit much for normal american kids ,  and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film ,  this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through .  while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward ,  miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments .  the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero ,  with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein .  and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work ,  the layers of meaning and metaphor ,  particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly ,  is pretty damn poignant .  as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films ,  only instead of over the top torture and gore ,  he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure .  f'n rad ,  and one of miike's best! 
1946 0 this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics .  the script is ludicrous ,  the acting is over-the-top ,  and it looks cheesy .  the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary meena kumari .  watching the actress ,  who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released ,  has the same fascination as watching a train wreck .  her ex-husband ,  amrohi ,  wrote and directed ,  but lacks the competency to execute either task well .  bollywood has produced far better films . 
1947 1 wow! so much fun! probably a bit much for normal american kids ,  and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film ,  this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through .  while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward ,  miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments .  the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero ,  with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein .  and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work ,  the layers of meaning and metaphor ,  particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly ,  is pretty damn poignant .  as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films ,  only instead of over the top torture and gore ,  he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure .  f'n rad ,  and one of miike's best! 
1948 0 this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description .  but to me it was a bit of a let down .  very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening .  it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not NOT_in NOT_sequential NOT_order) .  also ,  nothing of any consequence was being filmed .  i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part ,  which is different from the typical hollywood film .  but this one befuddled me to no NOT_end .  i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't NOT_do NOT_anything NOT_for NOT_me .  i still don't NOT_really NOT_understand NOT_what NOT_the NOT_filmmaker NOT_was NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_convey .  if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life ,  i guess he succeeded .  but i was looking for more .  needless to say ,  i can't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_anyone . 
1949 1 one of director miike takashi's very best .  it's so good it's difficult to put into words .  at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end . <br /><br />it recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) those films weren't NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_scare NOT_- NOT_there's NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_nasty NOT_detail NOT_here NOT_that NOT_i NOT_initially NOT_found NOT_jarring NOT_but NOT_soon NOT_realised NOT_it's NOT_nothing NOT_different NOT_to NOT_what NOT_i NOT_grew NOT_up NOT_on .  the film is a compilation of '80s kid's films conventions .  you name it ,  it's there: a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another ,  inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on; a sadistic henchwoman (go-go yubari from kill bill vol .  1); a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to .  but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth . <br /><br />one of the imdb reviews begins "where was this film when i was a kid?" and it's a sentiment i agree with wholeheartedly .  even while watching it i lamented the fact that i hadn't grown up on it; that it wasn't NOT_a NOT_part NOT_of NOT_my NOT_childhood NOT_like NOT_labyrinth ,  masters of the universe and ,  to a much lesser extent ,  the neverending story .  those films ,  and others like the goonies are recalled but never NOT_copied NOT_- NOT_miike NOT_relentlessly NOT_offering NOT_us NOT_a NOT_new NOT_take NOT_on NOT_things . <br /><br />poor cgi is a staple of many of his films ,  sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice - a desire to present things in an outlandish way .  here the cgi is mostly average ,  solely due to budgetary limitations ,  but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle .  the cg effects combine with traditional puppets ,  animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world filled with rich characters (and characterisation) that frequently borders on the visionary . <br /><br />this ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made .  not NOT_for NOT_younger NOT_or NOT_more NOT_sensitive NOT_kids NOT_though . <br /><br />just jaw-droppingly wonderful .  see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle/appreciate it then show it to them .  let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't . 
1950 0 i saw this director's "woman on the beach" and could not NOT_understand NOT_the NOT_good NOT_to NOT_great NOT_reviews .  this film is much like that one ,  two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else .  like his other films ,  you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog ,  wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten ,  pretty uninteresting characters .  if you feel you can like this film ,  don't NOT_let NOT_my NOT_review NOT_stop NOT_you .  i do like minimalism in films ,  but i feel tsai ming-liang's films are far superior .  he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kang-sheng in his films .  there is nothing here .  i wish iu liked it ,  but i don't .  oh ,  well . 
1951 1 also known as the big spook war .  the great yokai war is miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well .  the problem is that i can't NOT_imagine NOT_many NOT_parents NOT_wanting NOT_to NOT_subject NOT_their NOT_children NOT_to NOT_this NOT_movie .  the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery ,  neverending story and return to oz spring to mind ,  but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far .  in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not NOT_very NOT_suitable . <br /><br />the film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems .  this brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre quato homage) . <br /><br />following an incredible introduction for main baddie kato ,  and his henchwoman agi (a surprisingly attractive chiaki kuriyami) ,  by way of an apocalyptic army raising .  the story reverts to normal for a while ,  but it doesn't NOT_take NOT_long NOT_before NOT_any NOT_and NOT_all NOT_logic NOT_goes NOT_down NOT_the NOT_drain NOT_and NOT_the NOT_young NOT_boy NOT_teams NOT_up NOT_with NOT_a NOT_group NOT_of NOT_miyazaki NOT_rejects NOT_to NOT_take NOT_out NOT_the NOT_evil NOT_sorcerer . <br /><br />the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times ,  the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichã©s ,  but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world .  this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie ,  albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual miyazaki movie . <br /><br />the film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful ,  and largely practical ,  while the evil robotic monstrosities while not NOT_displaying NOT_the NOT_best NOT_cgi NOT_in NOT_the NOT_world NOT_have NOT_a NOT_practicality NOT_and NOT_menace NOT_to NOT_them NOT_which NOT_gives NOT_them NOT_far NOT_more NOT_of NOT_a NOT_palpable NOT_threat NOT_than NOT_you NOT_would NOT_imagine . <br /><br />the cast is uniformly excellent ,  they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits .  even agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from kuriyami . <br /><br />while the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory; cute creatures ,  junior heroes ,  a thoroughly evil villain ,  a sense of mischief and adventure ,  and a telling lack of violence .  there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a movie . <br /><br />the robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like t-101 sans skin and with added chainsaws .  these beasts rip characters to pieces; suck creatures into their blood stained mouths ,  and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parent's nose before indulging in a little patricide . <br /><br />the creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds .  the yokai ,  essentially the heroes ,  are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal .  if kids thought smouldering anakin was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle .  there is also limb severing ,  in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood ,  a fair amount of sexual energy (agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with kato as motivation ,  while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes) ,  and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for . <br /><br />spoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party .  the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything ,  complete with beer ,  crowd surfing and moshing .  also a scene where agi beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkill . <br /><br />end spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miike's stronger recent films .  while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say gozu or ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity .  in fact this is easily miike's most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly . <br /><br />well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of gogo arse . 
1952 0 i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many ,  but this was simply not NOT_a NOT_very NOT_good NOT_attempt .  its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original -- have not NOT_seen ,  and doubt i will .  it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot ,  lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (jimmy fallon) . <br /><br />fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that .  he's supposed to be a teacher you see ,  and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach .  the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable ,  but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot .  not NOT_fallon ,  who is neither funny ,  nor an actor ,  but appears to think he is both .  not NOT_once NOT_in NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_course NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_do NOT_you NOT_either NOT_believe NOT_fallon NOT_in NOT_his NOT_role ,  or believe that there is any way these two people should ,  or would be together .  near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not NOT_carry NOT_this NOT_one NOT_alone NOT_-- NOT_its NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_have NOT_a NOT_one NOT_person NOT_romance) NOT_tells NOT_fallon NOT_that NOT_its NOT_over ,  too much has happened ,  and she's moving on .  and rather than feeling bad about the scene ,  or sorry for fallon ,  you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago .  but of course the plot mechanics won't NOT_allow NOT_that NOT_to NOT_be NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_it NOT_(an NOT_end NOT_which NOT_actually NOT_might NOT_have NOT_made NOT_a NOT_statement NOT_out NOT_of NOT_this NOT_mess) ,  and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions .  its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying ,  but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else . 
1953 1 takashi miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements .  this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark .  even as a kid ,  i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books .  miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance .  the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom .  he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions .  westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids .  i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers .  he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain .  but a self-possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers .  i thought it was a great film .  highly recommended . 
1954 0 "fever pitch" isn't NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_film; NOT_it's NOT_a NOT_terrible NOT_film . <br /><br />is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs? that's the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and i use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film) is getting good reviews . <br /><br />i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny . <br /><br />the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film .  he adapted "fever pitch" for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997; peter hedges found hornby's voice for "about a boy" (2002) and when "high fidelity" was americanized for a movie in 2000 ,  writers d . v .  devincentis ,  steve pink ,  john cusack and scott rosenberg didn't NOT_go NOT_wrong NOT_because NOT_they NOT_kept NOT_the NOT_essence NOT_of NOT_hornby's NOT_wit NOT_and NOT_humor .  they made one of the best films of that year . <br /><br />so why does the american version of "fever pitch" go so painfully awry? the british version wasn't NOT_a NOT_masterpiece ,  but it was charming ,  funny ,  unexpected and gave us two characters we could like ,  respect and understand . <br /><br />but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby's work .  in americanizing the story ,  they've butchered it ,  removing all that was good and unique about hornby's work and replacing it with conventional drivel . <br /><br />they've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy ,  never NOT_once NOT_veering NOT_from NOT_the NOT_wretched NOT_formula .  lindsey (drew barrymore) has three girlfriends ,  each of whom has a distinct function .  one's overweight ,  the second's cynical and ambitious ,  and the third's a romantic .  want to guess how many male friends ben (jimmy fallon) has?<br /><br />what made "high fidelity" such fun was not NOT_only NOT_a NOT_good NOT_leading NOT_man NOT_and NOT_lady ,  but engaging supporting characters .  in this "fever pitch , " the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny .  they're so insignificant ,  they're not NOT_even NOT_decorative .  the only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it .  poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey's pals in a thankless role .  the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away .  come to think of it ,  cusack would've made an excellent ben .  of course ,  cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script . <br /><br />there isn't NOT_a NOT_single ,  solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced .  every plot turn is predictable ,  every lame joke telegraphed .  ganz and mandel labor for laughs .  the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow ,  you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy .  you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch .  it's almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru's formula pasted on the wall .  when they got to a certain page ,  they looked up at the formula and said ,  "ok ,  the guru says this has to happen now . " and ,  presto!<br /><br />directors bobby and peter farrelly don't NOT_help NOT_the NOT_film NOT_any .  they have no NOT_concept NOT_how NOT_to NOT_introduce NOT_their NOT_story NOT_and NOT_characters NOT_(they NOT_hand NOT_over NOT_the NOT_v . o .  narration not NOT_to NOT_the NOT_protagonist ,  but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park) .  thanks to some extremely clunky writing ,  we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings . <br /><br />barrymore does cute and adorable better than most .  she's as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday .  but even her cuteness can't NOT_save NOT_this NOT_extraordinarily NOT_awful NOT_film .  she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story .  about 30 minutes into the film ,  lindsey tells ben ,  "you're funny . " the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script .  for fallon's ben never NOT_says NOT_anything NOT_even NOT_remotely NOT_funny .  fallon is neither witty nor funny; when he does comedy ,  he overacts . <br /><br />fallon was never NOT_any NOT_good NOT_on NOT_"saturday NOT_night NOT_live . " he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show .  remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices? the only reason "weekend update" worked occasionally was because fallon's cohort ,  tina fey ,  knows a thing or two about comedy . <br /><br />actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely ,  if ever ,  are actually funny .  that's true of fallon .  he thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle .  his stuttering ,  unsure-of-himself shtick didn't NOT_work NOT_on NOT_the NOT_small NOT_screen; NOT_it's NOT_lousier NOT_on NOT_the NOT_big NOT_screen . <br /><br />unfortunately for fallon ,  his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments .  if you thought his comedy was bad ,  wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff .  two scenes in particular - the first in a park ,  the second in front of ben's school - are painful to watch .  the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability ,  but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work .  his range of emotions doesn't NOT_even NOT_run NOT_the NOT_gamut NOT_from NOT_a NOT_to NOT_b . <br /><br />ben has no NOT_personality NOT_or NOT_depth .  often ,  he comes across as an oaf .  and not NOT_a NOT_lovable NOT_one NOT_at NOT_that .  it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him .  compare fallon's performance to firth's in the british version ,  and you'll understand how terribly flat ,  unfunny and forced fallon's ben is and how wrong he is for this role .  watching fallon in "fever pitch" makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher!<br /><br />just as "high fidelity" did ,  an americanized "fever pitch" could've worked brilliantly .  it just needed better writers ,  more competent directors and ,  most definitely ,  a stronger ,  funnier ,  smarter leading man .  do yourself a huge favor: avoid this rotten film; rent the 1997 british version and read hornby's book ,  instead . 
1955 1 where was this film when i was a kid? after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather .  tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone .  grandfather is only "here" every third day .  moms never NOT_really NOT_home .  the kids always are picking on the poor kid .  during a village festival tadashi is chosen the "kirin rider" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice .  little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world . <br /><br />okay that was the easy part .  now comes the hard part ,  trying to explain the film . <br /><br />this is a great kids film .  no NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_great NOT_film , flawed ,  (very flawed?) but a great film none the less .  it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero .  watching it i felt i was reading a great book ,  and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book .  i loved that the film does not NOT_follow NOT_a NOT_normal NOT_path .  things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication ,  one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep .  there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it (which is typical miike) certainly its a takashi miike film .  that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching ,  scary and funny all at the same time .  no NOT_one NOT_except NOT_miike NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_that NOT_you NOT_can NOT_have NOT_many NOT_emotions NOT_at NOT_the NOT_same NOT_time ,  or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next .  i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful ,  that doesn't NOT_shy NOT_away NOT_from NOT_being NOT_scary ,  i mean really scary ,  especially for kids .  this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is .  this a dark grimms tale with humor .  my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world ,  then i realized who was making the movie .  hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images . <br /><br />its also operating on more than one level .  the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk .  its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters . one of the yokai (spirits) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed .  you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do .  its a wild concept ,  but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level .  (there are a good many riffs and references to other movies , tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not NOT_understand NOT_them ,  though many parents will) and of course there are the monsters .  they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between .  frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not NOT_thousands NOT_of NOT_monsters NOT_on NOT_screen .  its way cool and it works .  one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal ,  it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi's head .  (acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters) i mentioned flaws ,  and there are a few .  the effects are uneven ,  some of the sudden turns are a bit odd (even if understandable) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film .  .  none of them truly hurt the film over all ,  however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie . <br /><br />i really loved this movie .  i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time .  (where's the english dub?) . see this movie .  its a great trip .  (besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex) 
1956 0 i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren .  i'm a person who they call a cultural barbarian .  i hate art in any kind of shape or form .  rambo is more my kind of movie ,  action ,  kills ,  blood ,  horror .  if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague .  no NOT_one NOT_dies ,  no NOT_action ,  no NOT_nudity ,  nothing of the kind .  let me give you a rã©sumã© in a few sentences .  it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda .  every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler ,  except for a housewife ,  an anti fascist and a caretaker .  the housewife who is cheated by her husband ,  meets the anti fascist .  she falls in love with him ,  wants to make love to him ,  but the anti fascist is gay .  despite of this they make love with each other .  at the end of the day ,  the housewife reads a book from her gay lover ,  and the guy himself is deported by agents .  the end .  you want an even shorter rã©sumã©? boring .  .  .  that short enough? the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself ,  to save the audience from this atrocity .  on a side note my sister loved this movie .  like i said ,  i'm a cultural barbarian .  .  . 
1957 1 billed as takashi miike's "first family film" - by people who haven't seen zebraman ,  presumably .  yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness ,  diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale .  a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware .  the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done ,  with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the yokai) .  perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors ,  but i think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different .  he's really never NOT_been NOT_a NOT_one-trick NOT_pony ,  but often gets accused of it - perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics .  regardless ,  it's a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into . <br /><br />there's a very cartoonish feel to the production ,  evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places .  the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales ,  which certainly influenced miyazaki as well (particularly spirited away) .  it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with ,  so the special effects aren't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seamless NOT_hollywood NOT_style NOT_work NOT_- NOT_some NOT_blue-screening NOT_is NOT_especially NOT_obvious .  some of the special effects are great though ,  with some very well animated creatures (a mix of cg ,  stop-motion and puppetry) .  i think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap ,  and is all the cuter for it :) the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it's so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting ,  but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent (i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films!) .  chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece ,  though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared river princess - yum yum! those looking for another violent ,  perverted gangster film aren't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_find NOT_what NOT_they're NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_in NOT_yokai ,  but if you're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit ,  there's plenty to satisfy here .  and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got :) 
1958 0 anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics .  everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at ,  which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie ,  soylent green ,  are far better choices than those series .  soylent is probably science fiction 's best kept secret .  it remains one of the biggest ,  yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day .  charlton heston overdramatizes his role ,  yet it works .  edward g .  robinson ,  in his final role ,  makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching . <br /><br />it is manhattan in 2022 ,  the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150) .  a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the case . <br /><br />the secret of soylent green is not NOT_a NOT_mystery NOT_if NOT_you NOT_do NOT_research NOT_on NOT_the NOT_movie .  soylent is enjoyable to watch ,  but the whole screenplay is a joke .  it is just as cheap as the entire production .  the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie ,  yet were completely hilarious .  everyone seems to be a moron and no NOT_one NOT_knows NOT_the NOT_rules ,  specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments ,  peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants .  the character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie ,  but still you realize that soylent green sucks .  an enjoyable piece if you have the time ,  but do not NOT_expect NOT_anything NOT_more . 
1959 1 peaceful rancher robert sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors ,  that is until notorious outlaw robert preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field .  soon he begins to go too far ,  feeding a growing sense of unease in sterling ,  especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal . <br /><br />the sundowners is a tightly-paced ,  gritty ,  and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by preston .  here ,  he comes across as an evil version of shane ,  that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed .  most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise!<br /><br />rounding out the cast is chill wills ,  jack elam ,  and the debut of john drew barrymore ,  who became more famous for his offspring than his acting . 
1960 0 my first full heston movie .  the movie that everyone already knows the ending to .  a "sci fi thriller" .  the campy factor .  everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when i rented it ,  and on the morning that i watched it ,  it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that i was in (not wanting to move .  put in player ,  hide in blankets) .  and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture ,  it just really didn't NOT_make NOT_it .  everything was all over the place ,  relationships had no NOT_backbone ,  the ending had no NOT_lead NOT_in .  everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no NOT_choice NOT_but NOT_to NOT_leave NOT_partially NOT_dumbfounded NOT_at NOT_the NOT_ending NOT_that NOT_it NOT_gets NOT_to ,  because even though we all know that it's people ,  it's quick answers as to why it's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window . 
1961 1 the summary line above ,  spoken by james cloud (robert preston) to his brother tom (robert sterling) just about says it all .  jim ,  aka kid wichita ,  has a way of making things happen ,  only trouble is ,  he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been .  not NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_mentoring NOT_tom NOT_envisions NOT_for NOT_younger NOT_brother NOT_jeff ,  who likes what he sees in jim ,  especially when defending their ranch against local texas cattlemen . <br /><br />the opening credits state 'introducing john barrymore jr .  as the younger brother' ,  in this his very first screen appearance .  that seemed rather odd to me ,  particularly since he was addressed as jeff almost immediately into the story .  approximately eighteen at the time of this movie ,  he bears a passing resemblance to sean penn .  no NOT_stranger NOT_to NOT_personal NOT_and NOT_legal NOT_problems NOT_throughout NOT_his NOT_career NOT_as NOT_well NOT_as NOT_estrangement NOT_from NOT_his NOT_family ,  i was left wondering if his daughter drew barrymore might have ever seen this picture .  i'm inclined to think not . <br /><br />on the subject of resemblances ,  i was also struck by the thought that the young robert sterling looked a bit like roy rogers early in his career .  knowing sterling previously only from his role as george kerby in the early 1950's tv series 'topper' ,  i thought he looked out of place in a western ,  but that might just be me .  his character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble ,  and provides some of the edginess to this not NOT_so NOT_typical NOT_story .  minor subplots abound ,  including the relationship rancher john gall (john litel) has with his son the sheriff (who kid wichita kills) ,  and the troubled marriage between kathleen boyce (cathy downs) and her husband earl (who kid wichita kills) .  chill wills rounds out the main cast as one of tom cloud's hired hands ,  and figures in the somewhat predictable finale . <br /><br />what's not NOT_quite NOT_predictable NOT_is NOT_how NOT_things NOT_eventually NOT_wind NOT_up NOT_there ,  and for that reason ,  this western earns points for following a less traveled ,  hence not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_formulaic NOT_a NOT_plot NOT_as NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_good NOT_brother/bad NOT_brother NOT_westerns NOT_do .  combined with the eclectic casting of the principals ,  it's one i'd recommend ,  even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that i experienced with my copy . 
1962 0 as a great admirer of marlene dietrich ,  i had to (finally) watch this very ,  very dull picture .  it is miss dietrich's first color film ,  and the world's most beautiful blond is a redhead! bad start .  the story is a tremendous bore ,  involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff: religious guilt .  (who needs it???) suffice it to say ,  perhaps ,  that of all dietrich's films (and i have seen most ,  including "pittsburgh") this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching .  the color photography is ok (this is a very early technicolor release) ,  but to no NOT_purpose .  ridiculous casting: c .  aubrey smith ,  basil rathbone (enough said?) .  the only thing of any interest at all is john carradine's outlandish caricature of a performance as "the sand diviner , " who foretells all that will happen .  the supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived .  yet another example of david o .  selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film? -- other than that one?) and ,  for one final annoyance ,  the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess ,  with volume levels seemingly randomized .  highly unrecommended . 
1963 1 sterling and younger brother try to survive on land ,  being squeezed by big cattlemen .  when 'rogue' brother preston arrives ,  a moral dilemma ensues .  john 'drew' barrymore steals the show as the younger ,  impressionable brother-barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse .  moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax . 
1964 0 the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor .  a visual treat to the eye ,  the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart .  i was intrigued ,  at first ,  by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to "find" their capacity for love .  what follows is a huge disappointment .  boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment .  dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask .  as a monk ,  boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquer (which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse) -- when he leaves his "marriage to god" the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion .  the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past .  however ,  the journey that follows is all too predictable . 
1965 1 this is one of those westerns that ,  well ,  stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog .  very few can hold up to it over the long haul .  that said ,  the rest is pretty bad .  nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no NOT_other NOT_western NOT_with NOT_such NOT_consistently NOT_good NOT_dialog NOT_with NOT_maybe NOT_the NOT_exception NOT_of NOT_the NOT_wild NOT_bunch ,  junior bonner ,  and perhaps a few more .  <br /><br />it is riddled with weaknesses ,  john drew barrimore the most glaring .  however it does have one truly memorable scene .  nothing like it .  its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff ,  and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight .  wonderful stuff .  right up with the best in any western . 
1966 0 when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers ,  it was films like the garden of allah .  how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me .  also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not NOT_play NOT_a NOT_sexpot NOT_got NOT_stuck NOT_with NOT_such NOT_an NOT_old NOT_fashioned NOT_story NOT_is NOT_beyond NOT_me . <br /><br />the garden of allah ,  one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12 .  it then got two silent screen adaptions .  the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world .  he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent .  she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train . <br /><br />the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer .  i'm not NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_was NOT_in NOT_david NOT_o .  selznick's mind in filming this story .  someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience .  but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title .  the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting . <br /><br />as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret .  the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves .  the monks are a sincerely pious group ,  but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest . <br /><br />anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not NOT_suited NOT_for NOT_the NOT_parts .  most especially marlene dietrich .  i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot . 
1967 1 i think this film has much to recommend it ,  particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr .  foxx .  although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very ,  very hard to follow in some cases ,  all in all ,  it makes for a nice time in front of the tube . 
1968 0 this picture seemed way to slanted ,  it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq .  it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_wonder NOT_about NOT_it's NOT_legitimacy NOT_and NOT_bias .  also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd .  to me the subject matter seemed confused ,  it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light ,  as a) an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b) an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v . a .  this is a legitimate argument ,  but felt off topic for me ,  almost like a movie in and of itself .  i felt that "the war tapes" and "blood of my brother" were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint .  f- 
1969 1 i happened across "bait" on cable one night just as it started and thought ,  "eh ,  why not?" i'm glad i gave it a chance .  <br /><br />"bait" ain't NOT_perfect .  it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness .  but overall ,  this movie worked .  all the elements aligned just right ,  and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film .  <br /><br />most of that ,  i think ,  is due to jamie foxx .  i don't NOT_know NOT_who NOT_tagged NOT_foxx NOT_for NOT_the NOT_lead ,  but whoever it was did this movie a big favor .  believable and amazingly likeable ,  foxx glides through the movie ,  smooth as butter and funnier than hell .  you can tell he's working on instinct ,  and instinct doesn't NOT_fail NOT_him . <br /><br />the plot ,  while unimportant ,  actually ties together pretty well ,  and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person .  again ,  they could've slipped by without any of this ,  but it just makes things that much better . <br /><br />i'm surprised at the low rating for this .  maybe i just caught this move on the right night ,  or vice versa ,  but i'd give it a 7/10 .  bravo ,  mssr .  foxx . 
1970 0 'dead letter office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service ,  struggling to rebuild their damaged lives .  unfortunately ,  the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented .  what's most disappointing of all ,  however ,  is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no NOT_mechanisation NOT_whatsoever ,  and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living .  granted ,  part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure ,  but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s ,  if it ever truly existed .  it's a shame ,  as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry ,  and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince .  overall ,  it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film ,  with a concept and an outline ,  but sadly little else . 
1971 1 this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman ,  as we have an innocent (black) man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man .  usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster .  that does not NOT_apply NOT_here .  of course i love everything david morse does ,  so maybe my comments are not NOT_fair ,  but there were more good things about this film then that .  the main baddy ,  played by doug hutchison ,  was brilliant ,  and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli .  our hero ,  alvin sanders (played by jamie foxx) ,  was however irritating most of the part .  he is so out of place ,  cracking bad jokes ,  evoking no NOT_sympathy NOT_from NOT_the NOT_audience .  or not NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with ,  the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you (and on his followers as well!) .  i didn't NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_when NOT_i NOT_rented NOT_it ,  but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits .  7/10 
1972 0 this movie had a imdb rating of 8 . 1 so i expected much more from it .  it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous .  but before the movie is half-way through ,  it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable .  the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie ,  but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures ,  not NOT_real NOT_people NOT_at NOT_all .  this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times ,  only told here with slightly different circumstances .  the thing is ,  i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't NOT_so NOT_stale!<br NOT_/><br NOT_/>the NOT_only NOT_thing NOT_that NOT_could NOT_be NOT_worse NOT_is NOT_if NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_had NOT_inconsistent NOT_and NOT_unbelievable NOT_motivations ,  and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office .  hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon . 
1973 1 if you like jamie foxx , (alvin sanders) , "date from hell" , '01 ,  you will love his acting as a guy who never NOT_gets NOT_an NOT_even NOT_break NOT_in NOT_life NOT_and NOT_winds NOT_up NOT_messing NOT_around NOT_with NOT_shrimp ,  (jumbo size) and at the same time lots of gold bars .  alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw ,  and david morse , (edgar clenteen) ,  "hack" '02 tv series ,  decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals .  there is lots of laughs ,  drama ,  cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard .  jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture . 
1974 0 you know all those letters to "father christmas" and "jesus" that are sent every year? well ,  it turns out that they are not NOT_actually NOT_delivered NOT_but NOT_dropped NOT_off NOT_in NOT_a NOT_half-forgotten NOT_corner NOT_of NOT_the NOT_post NOT_office NOT_to NOT_rot NOT_unless NOT_some NOT_bright NOT_spark NOT_figures NOT_out NOT_a NOT_way NOT_of NOT_posting NOT_them .  as bizarre settings go ,  it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is "dead letter office" .  having said that ,  this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one .  if it was royal mail ,  most letters get this sort of treatment anyway .  i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang ,  some female priest of the church of latter day i've-never-heard-of-you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company . <br /><br />"dead letter office" (the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up) follows the story of alice (miranda otto) who grows up in a seriously divided home .  writing to her absent father ,  she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another .  so ,  logically ,  she gets a job at the d . l . o .  and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez (george del hoyo) .  slowly ,  she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the dead letters office to its knees?<br /><br />nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god-awful heather graham film "committed" while watching this .  however ,  this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again ,  that ain't NOT_difficult .  for a start ,  this film is much more logical .  true ,  the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood .  but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel .  it is also well acted .  both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never NOT_find NOT_while NOT_other NOT_characters NOT_are NOT_peripheral NOT_at NOT_best .  part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly ,  leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed .  the other part is that when you consider australia's draconian immigration policy (i . e .  if you don't NOT_speak NOT_english ,  rack off!) ,  such a story is unlikely to take place in reality .  the other characters ,  sadly ,  also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes . <br /><br />despite that ,  "dead letter office" is certainly something a little different .  it might not NOT_be NOT_to NOT_everyone's NOT_taste NOT_but NOT_i NOT_liked NOT_it .  yes ,  it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes ,  it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an australian film) .  there ain't NOT_any NOT_major NOT_laughs ,  there's no NOT_bullet NOT_time NOT_and NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_are NOT_usually NOT_one-dimensional .  but it's the story that counts here and while it's not NOT_earth-shattering NOT_in NOT_its NOT_magnificence ,  it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time .  it's the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't NOT_really NOT_miss NOT_it NOT_if NOT_it NOT_wasn't NOT_there . 
1975 1 the movie is great and i like the story .  i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell ( sick movie ) and highlander ( silly movie ) .  i just tell the truth ,  i like a reality hehe and also a true story :)<br /><br /> 
1976 0 this movie offers nothing to anyone .  it doesn't NOT_succeed NOT_on NOT_any NOT_level .  the acting is horrible ,  dull long-winded dribble .  they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for .  complete garbage ,  i can't NOT_believe NOT_what NOT_a NOT_laughable NOT_movie NOT_this NOT_was .  <br /><br />and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit ,  a wowing nc-17 movie .  the problem is no NOT_adult NOT_is NOT_going NOT_to NOT_stick NOT_with NOT_this NOT_film NOT_as NOT_the NOT_film NOT_plays NOT_out NOT_like NOT_a NOT_uninteresting NOT_episode NOT_of NOT_the NOT_oc NOT_or NOT_something NOT_aimed NOT_at NOT_teens .  pathetic . 
1977 1 i liked this movie .  when the guy who was in on a bank heist of $40 million in gold dies ,  his cell mate is used as "bait" to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner (by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge) .  it's an action ,  spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light .  it reminded me of enemy of the state .  well acted and good enough plot . 
1978 0 okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not .  before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it .  i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time .  so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought: the beginning started off fine for me .  it seemed to be heading in a decent direction .  got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie .  don't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong NOT_the NOT_rape NOT_scene NOT_was NOT_just NOT_as NOT_sad NOT_and NOT_scary NOT_but NOT_it NOT_didn't NOT_really NOT_bother NOT_me NOT_to NOT_a NOT_dramatic NOT_point .  then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on .  there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't NOT_have NOT_that .  it had about 3 of these pointless scenes ,  where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn't NOT_show NOT_it NOT_right NOT_making NOT_me NOT_want NOT_to NOT_fast NOT_forward .  then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't NOT_so NOT_boring NOT_but NOT_still NOT_a NOT_little NOT_dull .  oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job .  okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya's attention .  thats where it got disturbing .  i didn't NOT_feel NOT_bad NOT_for NOT_him NOT_or NOT_nothing NOT_he NOT_got NOT_what NOT_he NOT_deserved NOT_but NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_scene NOT_was NOT_really NOT_disturbing NOT_and NOT_i NOT_just NOT_felt NOT_all NOT_eck NOT_after NOT_it .  i cant really tell you whether or not NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_its NOT_so .  .  . i don't NOT_know NOT_i NOT_cant NOT_find NOT_a NOT_word NOT_to NOT_sum NOT_it NOT_up .  but if you choose to watch it just don't NOT_be NOT_unsuprised . 
1979 1 both my friend and i thought this movie was well done .  we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts .  we both thought that this movie may have not NOT_done NOT_so NOT_well NOT_at NOT_the NOT_box NOT_office NOT_as NOT_the NOT_previews NOT_lead NOT_us NOT_to NOT_believe NOT_it NOT_was NOT_a NOT_comedy .  i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job .  most of the supporting cast are veterans not NOT_first NOT_timers NOT_and NOT_they NOT_were NOT_solid .  we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie .  if you don't NOT_buy NOT_rent NOT_it NOT_for NOT_a NOT_good NOT_time . 
1980 0 do not NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_time NOT_or NOT_your NOT_money NOT_on NOT_this NOT_movie .  my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave) .  so ,  we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad .  it was .  i can't NOT_believe NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_was NOT_actually NOT_produced NOT_and NOT_put NOT_out NOT_to NOT_the NOT_public .  it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't NOT_make NOT_yourself .  i honestly feel emotionally scarred .  it went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick .  and really not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_one .  i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him .  almost .  all in all ,  an awful movie that was definitely rated nc-17 for a reason .  don't NOT_waste NOT_your NOT_money .  and don't NOT_let NOT_your NOT_kids NOT_watch NOT_it . 
1981 1 i really liked this movie .  of course the idea is pretty much out there .  .  . the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding .  but alvin sanders ,  the man who the feds have "volunteered" to be implanted with the device ,  is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while .  alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_easily NOT_manipulated NOT_as NOT_he NOT_may NOT_seem .  definetly worth a watch . 
1982 0 if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault ,  then this film is not NOT_the NOT_film NOT_that NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_watch .  it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back .  spoiler: rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant .  instead of using the criminal justice system ,  the victim resorts to using vigilantism .  she in essence nullifies the judicial system .  the film "the accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins .  what the "descent" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? is victim any better that the accuser? no!!! 
1983 1 i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie .  this movie was not NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_"deep NOT_thought" NOT_movie ,  which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be .  in fact ,  it would appear that if any movie doesn't NOT_produce NOT_a NOT_life NOT_altering NOT_insight ,  and a deep ,  twisted ,  mind boggling plot ,  they would rate it a 1 or 2 .  don't NOT_trash NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_you NOT_don't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_genre ,  people . <br /><br />this movie was an action/comedy flick ,  and that's all it was intended to be .  and for an action/comedy ,  it was very well done .  i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did ,  having never NOT_really NOT_been NOT_a NOT_jamie NOT_foxx NOT_fan ,  and having the over-used plot that it has . <br /><br />the plot was nothing spectacular ,  using the typical criminal gets out of prison ,  and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (see blue streak ,  hudson hawk ,  48 hours ,  etc .  etc .  etc . ) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist .  now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the real "bad guy" is an uber-geek . <br /><br />jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous ,  while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character ,  and didn't NOT_try NOT_to NOT_overdo NOT_the NOT_humor NOT_side NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . <br /><br />if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in "the matrix" or a drama such as "of mice and men" then this movie isn't NOT_for NOT_you .  but if you enjoy the raw action ,  excellent fast-paced filming ,  and an occasional twist of humor tossed in ,  this movie won't NOT_disappoint NOT_you .  i would normally have rated it about an 8 (on the same level as the die hard trilogy) ,  but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be . <br /><br /> 
1984 0 this movie was disgusting .  their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage .  what is garbage? the misuse of peoples time ,  the misuse of energy ,  and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write .  talia you are a sick demented loser .  your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem .  <br /><br />the acting and plot gave me no NOT_choice NOT_but NOT_to NOT_fast NOT_forward NOT_through NOT_the NOT_middle NOT_of NOT_the NOT_garbage .  i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for .  if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie .  i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "no more support from me . " how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho? i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene .  i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is; congratulations you won his attention .

1986 0 i'm going to write about this movie and about "irreversible" (the (in)famous scene in it) .  so you are warned ,  if you haven't seen the movie yet .  this are just my thoughts ,  why i think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended) . <br /><br />acting wise ,  rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words) .  the villain guy is good ,  but loses his "evil" touch right before the end .  if he really never NOT_changes ,  then why would he let a woman tie him up? he wouldn't ,  period .  then we also have the bartender/2nd rape dude .  actually i don't NOT_think NOT_you NOT_would NOT_need NOT_him .  at least not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_2nd NOT_rape ,  but more about that later on . <br /><br />let's reprise the story .  rosarios character is sexually insecure ,  might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend) .  this wasn't NOT_intentional ,  as rosario states herself ,  but there is sexual tension between them .  rosario's character meets a guy ,  who is a sexual predator ,  in all the bad senses .  but he makes an impression on her . <br /><br />rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before .  i beg to differ .  because she acts ,  as if it is her first boyfriend ,  which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother .  talking about her mother ,  here's another problem .  after the first rape takes place ,  rosarios character doesn't NOT_tell NOT_anyone NOT_what NOT_happened .  seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one ,  nothing of that gets explored after that .  if rosarios character wouldn't NOT_call NOT_her NOT_mother NOT_anymore NOT_or NOT_would NOT_behave NOT_strangely ,  the mother would be worried like crazy .  there was so much potential here .  also her female friend: we see her at the party ,  it's obvious there is something going on and "boom" she is gone . <br /><br />the first rape is almost unbearable to watch .  but feels like a pinch ,  when you compare it to the ending (rape) ,  which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer! after rape no .  1 we get too stretched out scenes .  threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian ,  as one guy states who tried to hit on her  .  .  . ) ,  but left in the open .  no NOT_real NOT_social NOT_contact NOT_is NOT_established ,  if you leave the bartender guy out ,  who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene .  it's apparent that he isn't NOT_a NOT_"nice" NOT_guy NOT_and NOT_his NOT_character NOT_get's NOT_fleshed NOT_out NOT_a NOT_bit .  but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again ,  his being in the movie seems pointless .  we get the point that rosarios character isn't NOT_the NOT_same NOT_anymore ,  that she went "bad" and is able to hurt people .  (too) many scenes show exactly that ,  her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff .  back to rapist #1 who cheats on a test ,  gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again (really?) .  as absurd as that sounds ,  the guy meets up with her ,  not NOT_without NOT_us NOT_having NOT_seen NOT_him NOT_beforehand ,  with another girl (very likely that he raped her too ,  although we never NOT_see NOT_anything NOT_of NOT_that ,  fortunately) and his football career .  well career is a stretch and he is bullied .  this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works ,  but then again is too clichã© to stay with you .  so rapist #1 submits to rosarios character  .  .  .  why exactly? because he promised her ,  it was her day? again ,  really? a guy like that never NOT_loses NOT_control ,  especially with a woman he raped before  .  .  .  i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is .  the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something ,  but letting him submit like that ,  just feels wrong .  another possibility would have a drug in his drink . <br /><br />so rapist #1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's rosarios character tie him on a bed  .  .  .  .  seriously ,  that's just crazy! but what comes next ,  is even crazier .  first she talks to him ,  then she "shuts" him up and forces an object into him .  this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one .  this isn't NOT_about NOT_what NOT_this NOT_guy NOT_deserves NOT_or NOT_not ,  it's just intense .  and of course that was what they were aiming for .  now after she is "done" the bartender guy comes in and rapes  .  .  .  rapist #1 .  if this really should work as a revenge movie ,  it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the "revenge" .  having a henchman doing the job ,  takes away everything that was built up . <br /><br />this isn't NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_entertaining/enjoyable ,  it's a hard watch & it is art-house .  but the 10 minute (i didn't NOT_count NOT_) NOT_rape NOT_scene NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end ,  just smashes everything .  rosarios character is more or less ,  only watching what happens .  which brings me to the biggest disappointment . <br /><br />irreversible comparison: "irreversible" had the rape scene ,  but the movie went on (even if it was back into time) .  rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this .  first ,  that comes a bit too late ,  that should see her say that after the initial rape .  and secondly and most importantly ,  this is where the art-house movie should've come in .  it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope ,  with what she had done .  but then again ,  she didn't NOT_actually NOT_physically NOT_do NOT_that NOT_much NOT_(see NOT_above) NOT_ .  .  .  a broken character that the movie cuts off  .  .  . <br /><br />good intentions (talia and rosario had worked before) ,  but failing to convey most of the things ,  they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant ,  it has to be convincing ,  otherwise it doesn't NOT_work) NOT_ .  .  .  not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_overlong NOT_rape NOT_scenes NOT_as NOT_they NOT_are NOT_ .  .  . 
1987 1 actually this movie was not NOT_so NOT_bad .  it contains action ,  comedy and excitement .  there are good actors in this film ,  for instance doug hutchison (percy from "the green mile") ,  who plays bristol .  another well known actor is jamie kennedy ,  from "scream" and "three kings" .  the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin ,  who was pretty good and also funny ,  but the one who most surprised me ,  was david morse as edgar clenteen .  he plays a different character than he usually does ,  because in other films like "the green mile" ,  "indian runner" ,  "the negotiator" or "the langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person ,  and in "bait" the plays almost the opposite ,  a man without any emotions ,  which was nice to see .  the only really negative thing about this film ,  are the several pictures of the world trade center ,  which makes this film perhaps look a little dated .  overall i thought this was a pretty good little film! 
1988 0 this movie sucked plain and simple .  okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped ,  and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist .  the rapist is a douche ,  but the girl victim is partly to blame .  i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff ,  but when the rapist tries to have sex with her ,  she doesn't NOT_allow NOT_it NOT_so NOT_the NOT_rapist NOT_rapes NOT_her .  and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't NOT_really NOT_expose NOT_or NOT_show NOT_anything ,  but when it comes to the rapist getting raped ,  it's a pretty long rape scene .  there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching . <br /><br />3 . 2/10 
1989 1 i watched this movie once and might watch it again ,  but although jamie foxx is good in the movie ,  i feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as alvin sanders .  foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen (david morse) are too funny .  david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop .  his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role .  once again morse meets doug hutchinson (bristol) in the theater .  morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson .  they are both perfect for this scenario in each film .  i personally love that quality in a film ,  where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film ,  as these two did in the green mile .  overall it was a pretty good movie . 
1990 0 rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge .  while its clear why dawson took the role ,  its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent ,  decidedly un-hollywood film ,  its also clear that aside from stunning good looks ,  dawson seems out of place in the role .  forgive me i simply couldn't find her .  thats not NOT_a NOT_mistake ,  thats how i felt ,  i had no NOT_idea NOT_where NOT_she NOT_was .  yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no NOT_impression NOT_on NOT_me NOT_whats NOT_so NOT_ever .  i blame the script for this since other than the ending ,  not NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_heck NOT_of NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_that NOT_happened NOT_on NOT_screen NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_make NOT_any NOT_real NOT_sense .  the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_fit NOT_together .  forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film ,  other than the end (which i would love to talk about but can't NOT_cause NOT_it NOT_would NOT_spoil NOT_it) ,  and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image ,  stayed with me . what can i say ,  this may click with you ,  it may not ,  for me it's time i can't NOT_get NOT_back .  for rosario dawson fans only ,  though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17 .  (and rosario- please ,  you're a better actress ,  pick better scripts) 
1991 1 this movie surprised me .  some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "enemy of the state" starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo (providing some comic relief) .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
1992 0 revenge is one of my favorite themes in film .  moreso ,  "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film .  having seen gaspar noe's irreversible (2002) ,  i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme .  instead ,  this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus . <br /><br />*spoilers* the end scene ,  a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene ,  came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy .  however ,  the film doesn't NOT_even NOT_follow NOT_through NOT_with NOT_this .  instead ,  the drawn out scene (which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or "this didn't NOT_fix NOT_anything" NOT_while NOT_the NOT_rape NOT_of NOT_her NOT_rapist NOT_is NOT_heard NOT_continuing NOT_in NOT_the NOT_background . <br /><br />my problem with the scene wasn't NOT_one NOT_of NOT_shock ,  but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience .  i mean ,  do we feel bad for the rapist? do we rejoice in dawson's revenge? are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity? aside from this failing ,  the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance .  character's are thin ,  dialog is monotonous ,  etc . <br /><br />normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't NOT_really NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_know NOT_what NOT_those NOT_were .  thumbs down . 
1993 1 this movie surprised me .  some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "enemy of the state" starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo (providing some comic relief) .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
1994 0 having just recently re-viewed "lipstick" for the first time in a few decades ,  i backed it with "descent" even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine . <br /><br />it's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years ,  from the full-on gore of "i spit on your grave , " to the tawdry sensationalism of "lipstick , " to the tasteful handling of the issue in "the accused . " but "descent , " though making some important points ,  never NOT_really NOT_offers NOT_us NOT_anything NOT_truly NOT_new NOT_in NOT_terms NOT_of NOT_revelatory NOT_meaning .  no ,  "descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that ,  when examined closely ,  isn't NOT_that NOT_groundbreaking . <br /><br />i pretty much knew the plot going in .  what i wanted to see *was* the "descent" or degeneration of dawson's character .  being a big fan of rosario's ,  i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted .  .  . you know ,  the kind of portrayal deniro brings to "taxi driver . " unfortunately ,  the script and the director/writer's choices don't NOT_provide NOT_any NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_believable NOT_transition . <br /><br />the biggest point of failure is the second act .  it became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping ,  drug use ,  and obsession with big black stallion adrian (every white boy's nightmare ,  natch) from a q&a on the dvd ,  but this excursion into dawson's character is never NOT_believably NOT_rendered .  we don't NOT_know NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_the NOT_hell NOT_she's NOT_doing NOT_half NOT_the NOT_time ,  what she's after ,  or why she's doing it .  the poor quality of the audio/video again don't NOT_help ,  but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless .  it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act .  by the time we get to the finale ,  our interest has already waned . <br /><br />one point of success that dawson does point out in the q&a is that by the end "revenge" scene we are pumped for retribution ,  then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is .  while that's certainly valid ,  it doesn't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_scene NOT_any NOT_more NOT_intriguing . <br /><br />if you have the dvd ,  check out the deleted "classroom" scene .  this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really does show dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift's prissy ,  condescending dorm counselor .  if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down ,  we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence . <br /><br />as the film stands in the final cut ,  though ,  all we get is what we've seen before ,  only in a more graphic rendering .  so what? 
1995 1 i have to agree with most of the other posts .  was it a comedy? a drama? to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side .  i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived .  jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name .  in new york ,  how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland . and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold .  again ,  a comedy or drama? but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning .  i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance ,  she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously .  she is a younger actress that is going to be viable . 
1996 0 it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself .  the paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the movie page has details i could not NOT_glean NOT_from NOT_watching NOT_the NOT_actual NOT_movie .  i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on .  alas ,  to no NOT_avail--this NOT_movie NOT_leaves NOT_out NOT_monstrous NOT_pieces NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story ,  if you could call it a story .  it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here ,  filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations .  newsflash to the the creators: i paid to watch you make a movie .  i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free .  and rosario dawson? this is somebody i've never NOT_paid NOT_enough NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_to NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_put NOT_the NOT_name NOT_to NOT_the NOT_face ,  and i can see why .  she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie ,  a or b .  i figured okay ,  maybe she didn't NOT_really NOT_want NOT_the NOT_role ,  just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't NOT_into? NOT_wrong .  she was listed as one of the producers .  next time you produce something ,  don't NOT_book NOT_yourself NOT_as NOT_the NOT_lead NOT_if NOT_you NOT_can't NOT_act .  if you really can ,  then create a decent character for you to become .  also ,  somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes ,  i hate to say it ,  but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats .  that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters .  the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no NOT_better NOT_than NOT_the NOT_story's NOT_antagonist .  as for the maya character ,  she didn't NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_a NOT_real NOT_person .  anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made . 
1997 1 this is a really interesting movie .  it is an action movie with comedy mixed in .  foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin .  it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next .  it was a well shot movie ,  the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel .  kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen .  she plays her role well .  even jamie kennedy is in this movie .  it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it .  it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan .  it deserves more credit than it is actually given . 
1998 0 i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment .  disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful ,  the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and ,  being a fan (sounds pervy ,  i'm not!) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's ,  i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out .  my conclusion: let's stick to the classics! yes ,  the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat ,  the actors unconvincing .  even dawson is empty .  some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us ,  that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial .  just like the scene where dawson gets raped: it seriously lacks intensity! i wasn't NOT_expecting NOT_anything NOT_'irreversible'-style NOT_but NOT_still ,  aren't NOT_we NOT_suppose NOT_to NOT_feel NOT_compassion NOT_for NOT_her? NOT_i NOT_didn't .  not NOT_for NOT_a NOT_minute ,  she was so lame all the way ;-) and i read that the photography was impressive .  well ,  it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either .  i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't NOT_so NOT_good NOT_so NOT_maybe NOT_i NOT_missed NOT_out NOT_something NOT_here NOT_but NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie ,  i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again .  lol .  more seriously ,  the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american-canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks - fire walk with me' .  .  .  the crude red and blue lighting ,  the heavy bass music ,  the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere .  .  .  no ,  i just couldn't get into this movie .  too bad . 
1999 1 i am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb .  the fanboy mentality strikes again .  when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it .  even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable .  years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying .  even laughing quite a bit .  this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay .  i don't NOT_see NOT_how NOT_since NOT_most NOT_of NOT_fuqua's NOT_movies NOT_are NOT_smarter NOT_than NOT_anything NOT_michael NOT_bay NOT_has NOT_came NOT_up NOT_with .  at any rate .  .  . <br /><br />story: alvin sanders(jamie foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense treasury agent edgar(david morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol(doug hutchinson) .  alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident .  while these agents are after bristol ,  bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry . <br /><br />jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders .  alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on .  doug hutchinson is okay as bristol .  he can be over-the-top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor .  he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher: war zone .  david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent .  even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie .  both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen . <br /><br />the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat .  the scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but i couldn't look away .  the director went all out there so he gets points for that .  plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty . <br /><br />all in all bait is not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie NOT_by NOT_a NOT_long NOT_shot .  its never NOT_boring ,  its always funny and i wasn't NOT_checking NOT_my NOT_watch NOT_every NOT_minute .  that should count for something .  bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period . <br /><br />ps: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent .  .  .  .  how long have you been living under a rock? i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino .  but those movies aren't NOT_violent NOT_right? NOT_weirdo .
