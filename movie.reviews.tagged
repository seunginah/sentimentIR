0 0 Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great <PERSON>Vilmos Zsigmond</PERSON>. Future stars <PERSON>Sally Kirkland</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frederic Forrest</PERSON> can be seen briefly.
1 1 <ORGANIZATION>Bromwell High</ORGANIZATION> is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as "Teachers". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that <PERSON>Bromwell High</PERSON>'s satire is much closer to reality than is "Teachers". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to <ORGANIZATION>Bromwell High</ORGANIZATION>. I expect that many adults of my age think that <ORGANIZATION>Bromwell High</ORGANIZATION> is far fetched. What a pity that it isn't!
2 0 <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON>'s character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. <PERSON>Swoozie Kurtz</PERSON> is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new <ORGANIZATION>IMDB</ORGANIZATION> rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
3 1 If you like adult comedy cartoons, like <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION>, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at <ORGANIZATION>Bromwell High</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Keisha</PERSON>, <PERSON>Natella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Latrina</PERSON> have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think <PERSON>Keisha</PERSON> is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school. There's the idiotic principal, Mr. <PERSON>Bip</PERSON>, the nervous Maths teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, <PERSON>Lenny Henry</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Gina Yashere</PERSON>, EastEnders <PERSON>Chrissie Watts</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tracy-Ann Oberman</PERSON>, Smack The Pony's <PERSON>Doon Mackichan</PERSON>, Dead Ringers' <PERSON>Mark Perry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Blunder</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Nina Conti</PERSON>. I didn't know this came from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, but it is very good. Very good!
4 0 I saw the capsule comment said "great acting." In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON>'s performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true "bummer." I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.
5 1 <ORGANIZATION>Bromwell High</ORGANIZATION> is nothing short of brilliant. Expertly scripted and perfectly delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a <ORGANIZATION>South London Public School</ORGANIZATION> leaves you literally rolling with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of <PERSON>Keisha</PERSON>, <PERSON>Latrina</PERSON> and <PERSON>Natella</PERSON>, our three "protagonists" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out the window in every episode. If you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then <ORGANIZATION>Bromwell High</ORGANIZATION> will not disappoint!
6 0 If I had not read <PERSON>Pat Barker</PERSON>'s 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately this is not the case. It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle.<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of <LOCATION>Union Street</LOCATION>. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down. Depressing yes, but utterly gripping.<br /><br />The film. Oh dear. <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> took <PERSON>Barker</PERSON>'s truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance...yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street'...no.<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into <PERSON>Fonda</PERSON>'s character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded. I accept that some of <PERSON>Barker</PERSON>'s tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling <PERSON>William</PERSON>'s score.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'...but without the happy ending.
7 1 "All the world's a stage and its people actors in it"--or something like that. Who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit--or even at the theatre door? Why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience, including the story itself?<br /><br />This film was a grand experiment that said: "Hey! the story is you and it needs more than your attention, it needs your active participation". "Sometimes we bring the story to you, sometimes you have to go to the story."<br /><br />Alas no one listened, but that does not mean it should not have been said.
8 0 This fanciful horror flick has <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another. He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him. His master scheme seems to back fire on him.<br /><br />Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces, but is still the only reason to watch this thriller. Supporting cast includes <PERSON>Patrick O'Neal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Murphy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eva Gabor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jay Novello</PERSON>.<br /><br />
9 1 FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>). Though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution. The story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.<br /><br />The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, <PERSON>Tom O'Horgan</PERSON> (who also directed HAIR and <PERSON>Jesus Christ Superstar</PERSON> on <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>).<br /><br />This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. And it just might change the way you see the world...
10 0 I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see <PERSON>CHACE CRAWFORD</PERSON>!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.<br /><br />However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.<br /><br />All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with <PERSON>CHACE</PERSON> in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But <PERSON>CHACE</PERSON> IS THE BEST!!
11 1 I came in in the middle of this film so I had no idea about any credits or even its title till I looked it up here, where I see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators. I'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as I watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON> himself. True he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as <ORGANIZATION>Schindler</ORGANIZATION>'s List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars. But in my opinion what <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie. And another recent score of his, for Catch Me if You Can, shows still more wit and sophistication. As to <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, I like education movies like How Green was my <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Konrack</PERSON>, that one with <PERSON>John Voigt</PERSON> and his young African American charges in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Danny deVito</PERSON>'s Renaissance Man, etc. They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story which can't be told often enough. This one is an excellent addition to that genre.
12 0 From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.
13 1 Fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.The acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography,screenplay,directing and editing.The story/script is only average at best.This film will be enjoyed by <PERSON>Fonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>De Niro</PERSON> fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.It would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy.......
14 0 This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.<br /><br />In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not, i mean Sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out clichÃ©.) Then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /><br />Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /><br />So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on "cool" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) <br /><br />It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a <PERSON>Vinnie Jones</PERSON> who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.<br /><br />So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it.<br /><br />1 for <PERSON>Vinnie</PERSON> and 2 for the editing.
15 1 Although I didn't like <ORGANIZATION>Stanley & Iris</ORGANIZATION> tremendously as a film, I did admire the acting. <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> are great in this movie. I haven't always been a fan of <PERSON>Fonda</PERSON>'s work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. <PERSON>De Niro</PERSON> has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold. He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart. I wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment, but I will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere.
16 0 6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens "storywise", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics
17 1 Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
18 0 This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.
19 1 Working-class romantic drama from director <PERSON>Martin Ritt</PERSON> is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> (both terrific). She's a widow who can't move on, he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of <PERSON>Pat Barker</PERSON>'s novel "Union Street" (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy. There are no overtures to serious issues (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story) and no real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree. The finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way. *** from ****
20 0 This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.
21 1 I'm a male, not given to women's movies, but this is really a well done special story. I have no personal love for <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> as a person but she does one Hell of a fine job, while <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> is his usual superb self. Everything is so well done: acting, directing, visuals, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner.
22 0 If you look at <PERSON>Corey Large</PERSON>'s information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called "Reload" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named <PERSON>Sebastian Cole</PERSON>.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't <PERSON>Sebastian</PERSON> get killed at the end of "Loaded"?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing <PERSON>Brooke</PERSON> was pretty, but not exceptional.
23 1 <ORGANIZATION>Liked Stanley & Iris</ORGANIZATION> very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement. The absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing. Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. Very enjoyable movie.
24 0 All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>' and <ORGANIZATION>'Candy</ORGANIZATION>' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by <PERSON>Vinnie Jones</PERSON> was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.
25 1 <ORGANIZATION>Liked Stanley & Iris</ORGANIZATION> very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement. The absence of violence and sex was refreshing. Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. Very enjoyable movie.
26 0 Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it "hot". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on <ORGANIZATION>Showtime</ORGANIZATION>, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.
27 1 The production quality, cast, premise, authentic <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Waterbury</LOCATION>, CT?) locale and lush <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON> score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star "decent" flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to do.........bring an art house style film mainstream. The small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups. <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable. I wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> instead of working in a dead end factory job in <LOCATION>Waterbury</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Robert DiNiro</PERSON>'s character was just a bit too contrived. An illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>'s character, a 1990 version of <PERSON>Henry Ford</PERSON> or <PERSON>Thomas Edison</PERSON>.<br /><br />This genre has been more successfully handled by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) "About <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>." I wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts.<br /><br />I'll give it an "A" for effort.
28 0 There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (<PERSON>Jesse Metcalfe</PERSON>) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (<PERSON>Nathalie Kelley</PERSON>). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at <PERSON>Nathalie Kelley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Monica Keena</PERSON>, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else...
29 1 This film has a special place in my heart, as when I caught it the first time, I was teaching adult literacy. It rang very true to me and even an outstanding student I had at the time. There are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion, and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation. <br /><br />Excellent performances by <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> that rank with their best work, a great turn by a young <PERSON>Martha Plimpton</PERSON>, an inspiring story line, and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience.
30 0 This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.<br /><br />Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still don't know why) I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is/was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence.<br /><br />This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making "Loaded". I don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies.<br /><br />That being said, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad".<br /><br />But this.......this crosses the line of "bad" into a whole new dimension. This is awkward bad. This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before.<br /><br />Every cheesy editing "effect" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the "shaky" camera "drug buzz rush" effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience.<br /><br />But.......and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him.<br /><br />If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
31 1 I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in <ORGANIZATION>Stanley & Iris</ORGANIZATION>, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a good movieÂ—just imagine what <PERSON>De Niro</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON> would have done on screen if someone had!
32 0 There are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching.<br /><br />"Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (<PERSON>Jesse Metcalfe</PERSON>), a young man who's about to make his mark on the world. He's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation, and he's on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things aren't quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriends <PERSON>Sebastian Cole</PERSON> (<PERSON>Corey Large</PERSON>), who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.<br /><br />While technically well-made, this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points, in some cheap attempt at style.<br /><br />Despite its cast of relative unknowns, performances were good all around, most notably with respect to the main antagonist (<PERSON>Corey Large</PERSON>). I suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future.<br /><br />Of course, when mentioning the actors, I must mention their looks. Rating based on hotness, this movies scores an 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not for buying, renting, or even seeing for free. It's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through.
33 1 I found this to be a so-so romance/drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it. It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered "normal" behavior but considering it stars <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON>, I would have expected a lot rougher movie, at least language-wise. <br /><br />The most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult. That's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but, to be honest, the film isn't that memorable.<br /><br />It's still a fairly mild, nice tale that I would be happy to recommend.
34 0 Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8Â½ minutes too long.
35 1 This is a complex film that explores the effects of Fordist and Taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations. There are constant references to assembly line production, where workers are treated as cogs in a machine, overseen by managers wielding clipboards, controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed, and firing workers (<ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION>) who meet all criteria (as his supervisor says, are always on time, are hard workers, do good work) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake. <br /><br />This system destroys families - <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> has to send his father to a nursing home (where he quickly dies) after <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> loses his job. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant. References are made to the fact that now, with declining wages, both partners need to work, the implication being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>' husband is dead from an illness, and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care, the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job (even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them). The one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail (presumably, he's also black, and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates). She remarks that he, like her, "is doing time" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave.<br /><br /><PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>, however, still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of Fordist capitalism. He cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as Iris' brother in law does (suggesting that he "married the wrong sister"). He does not, as <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> says, conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather, he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way, in a sort of Bauhaus ideal. This was the dream of early modernists and 1920's socialists (such as the Bauhaus) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs, allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations. He is also outside of traditional gender relations. He cooks, he cleans, he cares for his family, and he knows how to iron. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, on the other hand, lives in a traditionally male role - she's a factory worker, the mains source of income for her (extended) family, and she brings <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> into the public realm, traditionally off-limits to women. By teaching him to read and write, she gives him access to the world of knowledge, also traditionally gendered male.<br /><br />Literacy here is used as a metaphor for the (traditionally masculine) public realm and the systems of circulation (monetary, vehicular, cultural) that enable participation in the public realm. Without this access, <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning. He is excluded from all regular circulations, unable to participate in the monetary (can't open a bank account), in the vehicular (can't get a driver's license, can't ride the bus), and in the social (he asks if he exists if he can't write his name).<br /><br />After learning to read, he grabs books on auto repair, farming, and spirituality (the Bible). The Word of God is therefore relativized, placed on the same value plane as how-to books. In fact, organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the Bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> having sex. It is, however, acknowledged as a moral force - <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, clearly a character devoted to living a "good" life, mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching.<br /><br />Once able to read, he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan, a car, and a house, taking his place at the head of the family, the breadwinner. Presumably, he's an industrial designer, dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce. This ending, probably the only bit of conventional <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> in the film, is so incongruous with all that has come before that I at least wonder if it wasn't forced in by some Studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel-good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line.<br /><br />Now that, according to the pundits, we've comfortably moved on to post-industrial capitalism, the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel, as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period. <br /><br />Nevertheless, it's highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain. Disregard the ending, and it's close to a perfect 10.
36 0 This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the <ORGANIZATION>National Film Preservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION> says 1969 and <ORGANIZATION>IMDb</ORGANIZATION> says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and "with it" to be understood by us mortals.
37 1 `<PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>'s life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>. She decides to teach <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> learns to read, he goes off to a good job in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, only to return to <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> and ask her to marry him.<br /><br />It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films. A good film all round. <br /><br />
38 0 I am a big fan of <PERSON>Arnold Vosloo</PERSON>. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I love <PERSON>Arnold Vosloo</PERSON>, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the film, because <PERSON>Arnold Vosloo</PERSON> was in it.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>
39 1 I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here. I understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not evident. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> for her <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role. <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first I have seen <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again.
40 0 This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for <PERSON>Edward Furlong</PERSON>, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.
41 1 '<PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>' show the triumph of the human spirit. For <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>, it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential. For <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the movie is the dance that <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> do together, starting and stopping, before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on. In that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is, thus being credible. Unlike some other reviewers I found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture. The supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances. All in all an excellent movie. The best thing I take from it is Hope.
42 0 What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON>. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON> tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like "Lets get the F#$k out of here" and What are we going to do man". He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo <PERSON>Hoo</PERSON> ! Dumb Film. Poor <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON>. He will bounce back...
43 1 This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.<br /><br />The story revolves around <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>. <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> discovers that <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...<br /><br /><PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> competently plays <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect. They aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.<br /><br />I won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.
44 0 I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like <PERSON>Micheal Madsen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edward Furlong</PERSON> or even <PERSON>Arnold Vosloo</PERSON> to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..
45 1 If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON> is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role. His trademark style of acting works well for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are well for their parts. I did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward. The king in particular appears a real dunce though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart.
46 0 I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. <PERSON>Blonde</PERSON> would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.
47 1 OK, so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung (though <PERSON>Walken</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marner</PERSON>, particularly <PERSON>Walken</PERSON>, sounded pretty good). And so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the "battle" with the ogre, and praise the efforts of Puss in Boots when they by rights shouldn't have even known about it.<br /><br />Who cares? It's <PERSON>Christopher Freakin</PERSON>' <PERSON>Walken</PERSON>, doing a movie based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style fits the role very well as the devious, mischievous Puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he's thought about seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen <PERSON>Walken</PERSON> in any of his villainous roles, you *know* the ogre bit the dust HARD at the end when <PERSON>Walken</PERSON> got him into his trap.<br /><br />A fun film, and a must-see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON>.
48 0 I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. <PERSON>Edward Furlong</PERSON>, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.<br /><br />The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better.<br /><br />The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. <PERSON>Jon Keeyes</PERSON>, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have.<br /><br />Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night.<br /><br />vote: 1/10 (my first one)
49 1 Although this was obviously a low-budget production, the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing. One of <PERSON>Walken</PERSON>'s few musical roles to date. (he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel!) Also starring <PERSON>Jason Connery</PERSON>. A great children's story and very likable characters.
50 0 Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichÃ©s and still be entertained?<br /><br />Of course, it is still a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br />It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.
51 1 I never saw this when I was a kid, so this was seen with fresh eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter. Plus, the idea of <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON> singing and dancing made me curious. The special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was entranced. I loved watching <PERSON>Walken</PERSON> in this role thinking about what the future held for him. Very amusing to see him dance! And if the songs weren't great, at least they weren't <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> over-produced saccharine sweetness. The ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we had recently read "Puss in Boots", and I had wondered about the implausibility of the story. But while staying true to almost every aspect, <PERSON>Walken</PERSON>'s acting made it believable. Great fun. I'd watch it again with my daughter.
52 0 Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at <ORGANIZATION>AFI</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.<br /><br />3/10
53 1 When I was a kid I watched this many times over, and I remember whistling the "Happy Cat" song quite often. All the songs are great, and actually memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are lavish, and the acting is very well-done, which isn't surprising, considering the cast. <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON> is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human. And <PERSON>Jason Connery</PERSON>'s so cute, as the shy and awkward miller's son, <PERSON>Corin</PERSON>, who falls in love with beautiful and the bold Princess <PERSON>Vera</PERSON>. This is a really fun, enjoyable, feature-length movie, where unlike most fairytales, the characters are given personalities. Some of my favourite parts are when <PERSON>Puss</PERSON> makes <PERSON>Corin</PERSON> pretend he's drowning; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance, as it's "all the rage abroad"; when <PERSON>Walken</PERSON> is in the kitchen, dancing on the table (he's a pretty good dancer, too!); and when <PERSON>Vera</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Corin</PERSON> all the things she used to do when she was young, like pretending she was a miller's daughter. I'd recommend this film to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairytales. And it actually IS a movie you can watch together, as it won't drive adults up the wall.
54 0 Terrible movie. <PERSON>Nuff Said</PERSON>.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are <PERSON>Deniz Akkaya</PERSON>'s breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.
55 1 <PERSON>Emilio Miraglio</PERSON>'s "<ORGANIZATION>The Red Queen Kills Seven Times</ORGANIZATION>" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed. First of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end. The story, concerning a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the film's title, right?) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is an involving one, and the murderer, a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman, is both frightening and memorable. Every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the ridiculously beautiful <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON> as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, <PERSON>Sybil Danning</PERSON>, as a lustful tramp at <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>'s fashion house. Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and <PERSON>Bruno Nicolai</PERSON> provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. Gorgeous scenery? Check again. Filmed largely in <LOCATION>Wurzburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the picture is a treat for the eye indeed. OK, OK, but what about those murders? After all, isn't that what gialli are all about? Well, I'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out...not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and LOTS of 'em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of <PERSON>Ugo Pagliai</PERSON>, a hunky leading man for the female viewers. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from the fine folks at No Shame, and you know what that means: a gorgeous print and loads of extras, to boot! Thanks, guys!
56 0 This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON>, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.
57 1 And here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the Italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror. <PERSON>Emilio Miraglia</PERSON>'s "<ORGANIZATION>The Red Queen Kills Seven Times</ORGANIZATION>" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. It's a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of Italian cinema. The storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous "Red Queen". At young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> and <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> about an uncanny lady who, once every 100 years on April 6th, kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. Fourteen years later, <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. Sister <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the <LOCATION>States</LOCATION> recently... Or has she? Complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the Red Queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. Her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. She's not exactly gentle either, as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! That latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence I've ever seen! What more could you possibly request? Some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON> and a young <PERSON>Sybil Danning</PERSON>. <PERSON>Emilio Miraglia</PERSON> isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave", but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten.
58 0 I cannot stay indifferent to <PERSON>Lars van Trier</PERSON>'s films. I consider 'Breaking the Waves' nothing less than a masterpiece. I loved 'Dancer in the Night'. I admired the idea in 'Dogville' but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical, less cinema. 'Europa' which I see only now was a famous film at its time, succeeded in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> the relative success of an European film and got the Oscar for the best foreign language movie, but did not survive well the time in my opinion. It is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste.<br /><br />The story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer. Treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished, of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today, more such was novel and courageous two decades ago. Yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task.<br /><br />The film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>, especially his early films set in the pre-war <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, with brave British spies fighting evil German spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark. The trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism. Here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re-birth of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> after war, of its might, of its obsession with order and regulation, of punctuality and civility. The characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys. The principal character a young American of German origin coming to post-war <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption, with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers, with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self-destruction, with love doubtfully mixed with treason.<br /><br />It is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case. The actions of the characters, especially of <PERSON>Leopold Kessler</PERSON> played by <PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON> seem confused, and lack credibility. The overall cinematography seems to be not Hitchcock-like but rather from a bad imitation of <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> in the late 30s. The usage of color over the black-and-white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative. It is not that <PERSON>Van Trier</PERSON> does not master his artistic means, but he is too demonstrative, he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is. He really is great, as he will show in some of his later films, but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone.
59 1 There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see, and <PERSON>Emilio Miraglia</PERSON>'s "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" aka. "The <ORGANIZATION>Red Queen Kills Seven Times</ORGANIZATION>" (1972) is definitely one of them. With <PERSON>Gialli</PERSON> and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror, I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, and even though my expectations were high, this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes. <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON>'s earlier <PERSON>Giallo</PERSON>, "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed Giallo with Gothic Horror, but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite. "The <ORGANIZATION>Red Queen Kills Seven Times</ORGANIZATION>" is, hands down, one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian Horror films ever made, and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it. An incredibly mesmerizing <PERSON>Giallo</PERSON> with strong Gothic elements, "The Red Queen" delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: An inventive and incredibly compelling plot, spine-chilling suspense, a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, eerily lush colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score, and, not least, a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON> - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror.<br /><br />The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. As little girls, <PERSON>Kitty WildenbrÃ</PERSON>¼ck and her sister <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: Legend has it that a fiendish Red Lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people. Fourteen years later, <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> (<PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON>) has become a successful fashion photographer. Suddenly, people begin to get murdered... Director <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON> had already proved his incredible talent for style, atmosphere and colorful creepiness with "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem. "The <ORGANIZATION>Red Queen Kills Seven Times</ORGANIZATION>" is a feast for the eyes indeed, and one of the most overwhelming Italian Horror films both visually and plot-wise. The haunting painting in the Grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps. The Red Lady (or Red Queen, as she is called in the English title) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a Giallo, the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own. <br /><br />A sexy female cast is always appreciated, especially in a Giallo, and this one is a prime example for that. The ravishing <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON> (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen, and she is a great actress too. <PERSON>Bouchet</PERSON>'s presence has graded up many Italian flicks, among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest Cult-masterpieces of Italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): <PERSON>Fernando Di Leo</PERSON>'s "Milano Calibro 9", <PERSON>Lucio Fulci</PERSON>'s Giallo-highlight "Don't Torture a Duckling" and this unforgettable gem. Apart from the wonderful Miss <PERSON>Bouchet</PERSON>, the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young <PERSON>Sybil Danning</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marina Malfatti</PERSON> ("The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"), and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera. <br /><br />As the whole film, the murders are stylish and extremely elegant, yet frightening and macabre, and some of them are quite gory. <PERSON>Bruno Nicolai</PERSON>'s mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets, and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting. The plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings, the tension-level increses with each passing minute. "The Red Queen..." begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second. Overall, this is one of the films that I cannot find enough words of praise for. "The <ORGANIZATION>Red Queen Kills Seven Times</ORGANIZATION>" is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest <PERSON>Gialli</PERSON> ever made, and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see. 10/10
60 0 I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the <ORGANIZATION>TMNT</ORGANIZATION> to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like <PERSON>Leonardo</PERSON> , <PERSON>Michelangleo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Raphel</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Donatello</ORGANIZATION> so <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.
61 1 An old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold.<br /><br />People are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed.<br /><br /><PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> (<PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON>) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it <PERSON>Franziska</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marina Malfatti</PERSON>)? Is it <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is superb in this thriller from <PERSON>Emilio Miraglia</PERSON>, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know.<br /><br />The only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>.
62 0 This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over <ORGANIZATION>Power Rangers</ORGANIZATION> to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO <PERSON>VENUS</PERSON>. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie, some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies, what's with the thing around raph's thigh? the silly looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /><br />If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good.
63 1 Once upon a time in a castle...... Two little girls are playing in the garden's castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (<PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>) and a brunette one (<PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON>). <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> steals <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>'s doll. <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> pursues <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON>. Running through long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, reads the newspaper. <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> complains about <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON>, while <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> begins to say repeatedly: "I am the red lady and <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON> is the black lady". Suddenly <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>'s doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head. A fight ensues. And <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> almost uses the dagger against <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.<br /><br />Later on, their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red:<br /><br />"A long time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One night, for jealousy reasons, the black lady entered the red lady's room and stabbed her seven times. One year later, the red lady left her grave. She killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady. Once every hundred years, the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself."<br /><br />The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend, sixteen years from now, the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend.<br /><br />Sixteen years pass.....<br /><br />This is the very beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film. It's better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it, the story doesn't make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors, the gorgeous women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack.<br /><br />Enjoy <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sybil Danning</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marina Malfatti</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pia Giancaro</PERSON>, among other goddesses. There's a nude by <PERSON>Sybil Danning</PERSON> lying on a sofa that's something to dream about. And don't forget: The lady in red kills seven times!<br /><br />If you've liked "La <PERSON>Dama Rossa</PERSON>..." check out also "La Notte che Evelyn uscÃ¬ dalla <PERSON>Tomba</PERSON>".
64 0 Sometime in 1998, <PERSON>Saban</PERSON> had acquired the rights to produce a brand-new Ninja Turtles live-action series. Naturally, being a fan of the <ORGANIZATION>TMNT</ORGANIZATION> back in the day, this obviously peaked my interest. So when I started watching the show... to say I was disappointed by the end result is an understatement. Some time later (more like recently), I got a chance to revisit the series.<br /><br />First off, let's talk about some of the positives. They managed to re-create the Turtles' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this. There tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot. And the Turtle suits, while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series.<br /><br />People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a Power Rangers show. But you can only have Shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain... and besides, most fans don't realize or don't remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic, the Shredder was offed in the very first issue! Never mind the countless resurrections that would follow. So on a personal standpoint, I was sort of glad they got rid of Shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode. I find that Shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they end up replacing him with these original villains who, as stated, seemed more fit for a <ORGANIZATION>Power Rangers</ORGANIZATION> show than a <ORGANIZATION>Ninja Turtles</ORGANIZATION> show. And with these new magic-wielding generics comes a new female magic-wielding turtle, the infamous <PERSON>Venus De Milo</PERSON>. I'll be honest; I never got comfortable with her. I'm not against the idea of a female turtle; I'm just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain. I almost get the impression that this could have easily been the <PERSON>Venus De Milo</PERSON> show dealing with her make-believe enemies and the TMNT are just there to provide the star power (or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released). Fortunately, they all share the spotlight together.<br /><br />Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. Given time and maybe another season, I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness. But while the idea was sound, the execution was flawed (although there are a couple good episodes in this series). As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those oddities in <LOCATION>Turtledom</LOCATION> that is best left buried and forgotten.
65 1 <PERSON>Emilio Miraglia</PERSON>'s first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second film is even better! We've got more of the Giallo side of the equation this time around, although <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON> doesn't lose the Gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight. <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON> puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical Giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes. This is a definite bonus for the film, however, as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON>'s storytelling has improved since his earlier movie. The plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. The legend revolves around a woman called 'The Red Queen' who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. A few years later, murders begin to occur...<br /><br />Even though he only made two Giallo's, <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON> does have his own set of tributes. It's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called '<PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON>'. He likes castles, Gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON> may be no <PERSON>Argento</PERSON> when it comes to spilling blood, but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> Beetle, and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite Giallo death scenes. The female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marina Malfatti</PERSON> heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off! The score courtesy of <PERSON>Bruno Nicolai</PERSON> is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave; it fits the film well. The ending is something of a turn-off, as although <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON> revs up the Gothic atmosphere, it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious. But even so, this is a delightfully entertaining <PERSON>Giallo</PERSON> and one that I highly recommend to fans of the genre!
66 0 This is the worst thing the <ORGANIZATION>TMNT</ORGANIZATION> franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.<br /><br />There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable.<br /><br />The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...
67 1 This interesting Giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.<br /><br />Directed by <PERSON>Emilio P. Miraglia</PERSON> who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting "La Notte che <PERSON>Evelyn Usci</PERSON> della <PERSON>Tomba</PERSON>" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.<br /><br />This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "Horror House". At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. But the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.<br /><br />A convincing <PERSON>Giallo</PERSON> with obligatory twists and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to <PERSON>Miraglia</PERSON>'s above mentioned other thriller.
68 0 Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!<br /><br />A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)<br /><br />Ridiculous!!! If youÂ´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this. Yeah right.
69 1 What a fun movie! If you're a Giallo fan, Red Queen Kills 7 <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with <PERSON>Barbara Bouchet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marina Malfatti</PERSON> in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent <PERSON>Bouchet</PERSON> as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. The convoluted plot held my interest throughout. Finally, <PERSON>Bruno Nicolai</PERSON>'s score may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days.<br /><br />The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come in the film's finale. First, the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. If you've seen more than a couple Gialli, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. Second, the ending feels a little too rushed and, as a result, is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me, but I'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. A second viewing might just clear this up.
70 0 <ORGANIZATION>Sexo Cannibal</ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON> as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts with actress & model <PERSON>Laura Crawford</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ursula Buchfellner</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ursula Fellner</PERSON>) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gisela Hahn</PERSON>). After a long days work <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> (<PERSON>Werner Pochath</PERSON>) & <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> (Antonio Mayans) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>. <PERSON>Laura</PERSON>'s agent gets on the blower to rent-a-hero <PERSON>Peter Weston</PERSON> (<PERSON>Al Cliver</PERSON>) who is informed of the situation, the kidnappers have <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is told that he will be paid 200,000 to get her back safely & a further 10% of the 6 million if he brings that back as well, faster than a rat up a drain pipe <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> & his <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Vet buddy helicopter pilot <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> are on the island & deciding on how to save <PERSON>Laura</PERSON>. So, the kidnappers have <ORGANIZATION>Laura & Peter</ORGANIZATION> has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much. Just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe (hell, in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw hut, now that's primitive) who worship some cannibal monster dude (<PERSON>Burt Altman</PERSON>) with bulging eyes as a God with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young, white female flesh & intestines...<br /><br />This Spanish, French & German co-production was co-written & directed by the prolific <PERSON>Jesus Franco</PERSON> who also gets the credit for the music as well. Sexo Cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> as it was placed on the 'Video Nasties' list in the early 80's under it's alternate Devil Hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned, having said that I have no idea why as it is one bad film & even <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>, who isn't afraid to be associated with a turkey, decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of <PERSON>Clifford Brown</PERSON>. I'd imagine even the most die-hard <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> fan would have a hard time defending this thing. The script by <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>, erm sorry I mean <PERSON>Clifford Brown</PERSON> & <PERSON>Julian Esteban</PERSON> as <PERSON>Julius Valery</PERSON> who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed, is awful. It's as simple & straight forward as that. For a start the film is so boring it's untrue, the kidnap plot is one of the dullest I've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things don't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over-sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes. As a horror film Sexo Cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no more success, this is one to avoid.<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> shows his usual incompetence throughout, a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it's not attached to anything! The cannibal scenes are poor, the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'A' to 'B' & not really doing anything when they get there either. It becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & don't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it's uncut state. I also must mention the hilarious scene when <PERSON>Al Cliver</PERSON> is supposed to be climbing a cliff, this is achieved by <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> turning his camera on it's side & having <PERSON>Cliver</PERSON> crawl along the floor! Just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along! The gore isn't that great & as far as Euro cannibal films go this is very tame, there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat, a man is impaled on spikes, there's some blood & a handful of intestines. There's a fair bit of nudity in Sexo Cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Sexo Cannibal</ORGANIZATION> must have had a low budget & I mean low. This is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values. The only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic. The music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen. The acting sucks, the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Sexo Cannibal</ORGANIZATION> is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell. The only good things I can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross. Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give <ORGANIZATION>Sexo Cannibal</ORGANIZATION> as wide a berth as possible, one to avoid.
71 1 When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the dreadful Red Queen figurine, I felt certain I was in for a big disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles, let alone take in the ridiculous explanation. These quibbles apart, however, the film is a dream. Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful <PERSON>Bruno Nicolai</PERSON> score. He may not be <PERSON>Morricone</PERSON> but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so. Really enjoyable with lots of colour, plenty of sexiness, some gory kills and minimal police interference. Super.
72 0 This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.
73 1 Another good Stooge short!Christine <PERSON>McIntyre</PERSON> is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one!She is such a great actress!The Stooges are very good and especially <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON> and Larry!This to is a good one to watch around Autumn time!
74 0 <ORGANIZATION>Devil Hunter</ORGANIZATION> gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION> 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION>) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself "The Devil" (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and <PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON> is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION>'s list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.
75 1 Of the elements that make this the best at this point, I have to say #1 is <PERSON>Christine McIntire</PERSON>. <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON>'s scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. I imagine that, as one poster suggested, <PERSON>Christine</PERSON> was trying to hold back laughter during that scene, but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil, to be smiling at <ORGANIZATION>Shemp</ORGANIZATION>'s possibly dying.<br /><br />Another character who helps this stand out is the Goon. His look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball. Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter anywhere. I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is this good, who's going to complain. Not I.
76 0 or anyone who was praying for the sight of <PERSON>Al Cliver</PERSON> wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! Film starlet <PERSON>Laura Crawford</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ursula Buchfellner</PERSON>) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. What they don't count on is rugged <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vet <PERSON>Peter Weston</PERSON> (<PERSON>Cliver</PERSON>) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (<PERSON>Franco</PERSON> confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including <PERSON>Gisela Hahn</PERSON> (CONTAMINATION) and <PERSON>Werner Pochath</PERSON> (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). The film features tons of nudity and the gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between <PERSON>Cliver</PERSON> and <PERSON>Antonio de Cabo</PERSON> in the splashing waves. Sadly, ol' <PERSON>Jess</PERSON> pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about <PERSON>Buchfellner</PERSON> than his CANNIBALS star <PERSON>Sabrina Siani</PERSON>.
77 1 One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever. A spooky house full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenge the Alert Detective Agency's best men. <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON> is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene. <PERSON>Emil Sitka</PERSON> provides excellent support in his Mr. <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON> role, as the target of a murder plot. Before it's over, <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON>'s "trusty little shovel" is employed to great effect. This 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any Stooge's short and packs twice the wallop. Highly recommended.
78 0 An actress making a movie in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires some one to go and bring her back. Complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking "god" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />This is a gory sleazy movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. There are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that "I'll do what I want". Its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(An aside. VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. Their print also has no opening titles)
79 1 This is apparently one of <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON>'s first shorts with the Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team). But the threesome's comedic timing is at its honed best here. Aside from the intense slapstick scenes, there are others more subtle, but just as funny. Watch <PERSON>Larry</PERSON> when <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON> asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or watch the real object prompting <PERSON>Moe</PERSON>'s exclamation, "Oh...highly polished mahogany!"<br /><br /><PERSON>Emil Sitka</PERSON> is at his bewildered goofiest. And the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny. He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are "regular" people in other shorts.<br /><br />For <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON> aficionados, this is a must have episode. It won't disappoint.
80 0 A model named <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> is working in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle. They demand a huge ransom for her release. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>. They try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that (not going well so far). Also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts. In reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem. He starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> escapes only to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really.<br /><br />Now I'm not a massive <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> fan, in fact to date this is only the second film of his I have seen, but even I can tell that this really isn't one of his best efforts. The films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening. The whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute TV show. There are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out.<br /><br /><PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON> is poorly lit (<ORGANIZATION>Infact</ORGANIZATION> I don't think it was lit at all), badly dubbed, poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't bore me. I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. For example a scene where <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting. Another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed, hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes. Then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him. It has to be seen to be believed. Then of course there is the actual devil. It is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes, he has very blurry vision.<br /><br />The film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80's here in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and was banned. Now why it was I have no idea. There is very little gore at all and it's hardly a shocking film. Minus the nudity I would have said that it could get away with a PG almost. The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth.<br /><br />There is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> fan. There is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise I would say just pay for a ticket to <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and get lost in a jungle. It would probably be more fun.<br /><br />3/10
81 1 An ultra-nervous old man, "Mr. <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON>," terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing, really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it, saying "You will be next!" <br /><br />He calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier. Of course, it's the Stooges, who couldn't respond because had come into the office, robbed them and tied them up. Some detectives! The moment poor Mr. <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON> hangs up the phone and says, "I feel safer already," a monster-type goon named "Nico" appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious. We next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that. Now these crooks have to deal with the "detectives" that are coming by the house for Mr. <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON>.<br /><br />Some of the gags, like <PERSON>Moe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry</PERSON>'s wrinkles, are getting a bit old, but some of them will provoke laughs if I see them 100 times. I always laugh at <LOCATION>Shemp</LOCATION> trying to be a flirt, as he does here with Mr. <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON>'s niece, in a classic routine with a long, accordion-like camera lens. The act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny, too. <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON> was so good that I didn't mind he was taking the great Curly's place.<br /><br /><PERSON>Larry</PERSON>, <PERSON>Moe</PERSON>, Curly/Shemp were always great in the chase scenes, in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house. That's the last six minutes in here. At times, such as this film,
82 0 How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />Some reviews have placed the location in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, others in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, I thought it was in some random island in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young <PERSON>Frank Zappa</PERSON> banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />One of the "freakiest" moments in the film is when, "Pablito" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and "Pablito" kicks it a bit for what I assume is "shits n' giggles" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />But, of course, then the "freak" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.
83 1 "Who Done It?" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON>, it is one of the finest short comedies <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> produced. Director <PERSON>Bernds</PERSON> originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when <PERSON>Curly Howard</PERSON> suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> comedy team of Schilling and <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror.") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON> calls ace detectives <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON>, <PERSON>Larry</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Moe</PERSON> out of fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON> has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON> and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br /><PERSON>Shemp</PERSON> is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by <PERSON>Christine McIntyre</PERSON> are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss <PERSON>McIntyre</PERSON> is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of <PERSON>Moe</PERSON>'s mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by <PERSON>Duke York</PERSON>) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film. With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else! "Who Done It?" is a gem among the Stooges films with <PERSON>Shemp</PERSON>. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
84 0 Of the three titles from <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> to find their way onto the Official <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION> Video Nasty list (<PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON>, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde <PERSON>Ursula Buchfellner</PERSON> plays movie star <PERSON>Laura Crawford</PERSON> who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by <PERSON>Laura</PERSON>'s agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary <PERSON>Peter Weston</PERSON> (<PERSON>Al Cliver</PERSON>) and his <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br /><PERSON>Franco</PERSON> directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.
85 1 <ORGANIZATION>Busy Phillips</ORGANIZATION> put in one hell of a performance, both comedic and dramatic. <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> was good but <PERSON>Busy</PERSON> stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which wasnt all that great. If Busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
86 0 This video nasty was initially banned in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, and allowed in last November without cuts.<br /><br />It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, <PERSON>Ursula Buchfellner</PERSON>. The opening cuts back and forth between <LOCATION>Buchfellner</LOCATION> and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br /><PERSON>Laura</PERSON> (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> (<PERSON>Al Cliver</PERSON> - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (<PERSON>Antonio de Cabo</PERSON>) manages to pass the time productively, while another (<PERSON>Werner Pochath</PERSON>) whines incessantly.<br /><br />The ransom exchange goes to hell, and <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> runs into the jungle. <PERSON>Will Peter</PERSON> save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! <PERSON>Muriel</PERSON> MontossÃ© is found by <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and his partner (<PERSON>Antonio Mayans - Angel</PERSON> of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. MontossÃ© is very comfortably undressed. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> leaves them and goes off alone to find <PERSON>Laura</PERSON>, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and the naked devil (<PERSON>Burt Altman</PERSON>).<br /><br />Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (<PERSON>Aline Mess</PERSON>), and the line, "They tore her heart out," which is hilarious if you see the film.
87 1 I liked this movie a lot. It really intrigued me how <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> became friends over such a tragedy. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> was just a troubled soul and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> was so happy just to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things. Other than that it was great.
88 0 Not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director..."Devil Hunter" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run." <PERSON>Chick</PERSON> gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.
89 1 When i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply moved. Everyone i have encountered, I have recommended this movie to. No one has come back saying it was bad. Busy, also did a great job with her role in this film. I don't know much about her acting career but wow, they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great.<br /><br />At the beginning it was a little slow. But after she went to the hospital....wow, the movie picks up again. i have no idea why this movie hasn't been spoken of in the movie world. My wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more...because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half.
90 0 As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my "to rent" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION> looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
91 1 Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Wondering what the secret <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is hiding. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time. I wish I could find more movies like that one. All in All I thought it was a great movie. The more you watch of it the more you become part of it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had shattered just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I loved it so much.
92 0 I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around <LOCATION>amazon</LOCATION> jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. <PERSON>Laura Crawford</PERSON> is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>. They take her into the jungle <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself "The Devil" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. <PERSON>Peter Weston</PERSON>, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,
93 1 Just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time, picked it up one night previously viewed at Blockbuster and absolutely loved it, I've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well. Avoid of all the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> glamour, special effects and stress on the "shock factor", this independent film by <PERSON>Paul F. Ryan</PERSON> hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations. Taking place after a high school shooting, two characters <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Busy Philipps</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> (<PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON>) form an unlikely bond. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>, the girl with the stone heart, the Goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath. Meanwhile <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> attempts to help <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> to see some of the softness and light in the world again. Not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting, but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart. Despite its low-budget and short filming time, this movie is far from cheesy. <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche. With an amazing up and coming actress, <PERSON>Philipps</PERSON>, adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON> helps to balance out the "doom and gloom" feeling this movie may have. Overall, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it, I also suggest the documentary "It's a Girls World" put out by <ORGANIZATION>CBC</ORGANIZATION> in 2004, which deals with the topic of social bullying, comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, the group of friends and acquaintances of <PERSON>Dawn Marie Wellesley</PERSON> a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied.
94 0 When a man who doesn't have Alzheimer's can't remember how many films he's made, he probably is the world's most prolific director after all. That man is <PERSON>Jesus Franco</PERSON>, the king of so-called 'eurotrash'. His 1980 flick <PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON> is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading, for starters) as any other <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> film I've seen. That makes it sound pretty awful, and it is... Yet <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. The mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious.<br /><br /><PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON> is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour. The kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>. There's lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole. You need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>'s main methods of extending a film out to feature length.<br /><br />The monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. He has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. Early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here but I think he ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON>!).<br /><br />Anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers. The flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpudlian and all retarded. All of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.<br /><br />Not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. The nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself. That he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it's gotta be done at some point, and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera.<br /><br />The best feature of <PERSON>Devil Hunter</PERSON> is the location filming. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making, but he doesn't muck around with sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI sets and backdrops ad nauseam.<br /><br />Ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. If you're trying to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you'll be made as restless as I was. If you like <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>, you'll watch this anyway. If you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you'll never come across this film. Copies of it aren't just lying around, and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it. It's <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>. Lazy, crazy <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>.
95 1 It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be. its very underrated. people forgot what movies are really about, nowadays they only think about bum bum movies, which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends, like transformers, movies which are oriented, with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher, on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline. Its the kind of a movie what i despite most. Of course it is fun watching greatly made CGIs, but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies.<br /><br />I honestly think that performance was excellent. Especially <PERSON>Busy Philipps</PERSON>, alongside with <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Victor Garber</PERSON>(whom i respect) made this movie an Oscar worth. Emotional performance by <PERSON>Busy Philipps</PERSON> was astonishing, its such a shame we wont see Oscar in her hands, which she deserves.
96 0 There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and <PERSON>Matthew Mconaughey</PERSON> was just awesome in "A Time to kill" , and the "The Newton Boys " so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a <PERSON>Matthew Mconaughey</PERSON> film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />The films star though, <PERSON>Patrick McGaw</PERSON> is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.<br /><br />So for true <PERSON>Mcconaughey</PERSON> acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, "A Time to kill" , "The Newton Boys " "Frailty", "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" and avoid too "Larger Than Life" and "Angels in the Outfield" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.
97 1 I'm from <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one, please.....?
98 0 A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch <PERSON>Lalo Schifrin</PERSON>'s soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.
99 1 If you "get it", it's magnificent.<br /><br />If you don't, it's decent.<br /><br />Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting. There is so much more to this movie that, at times, the school shooting becomes insignificant.<br /><br />Above all, it's a movie about acceptance, both superficially--of a traumatic event, but also of people who are different for whatever reason.<br /><br />It's also a movie about unendurable pain, and how different people endure it. In this case, the contrast between <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>'s rage and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>'s obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat. Thankfully, the audience is given credit for being human beings; our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy, implausibly moralistic ending.<br /><br />Above and beyond that, I try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that. Yet I must admit, I cried like a lost little baby during this movie. There were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.
100 0 Three part "horror" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go "out there" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though.<br /><br />The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.
101 1 My children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest. I had to head out for bowling league so I had them record it for me on the dvr so I could watch the rest later. Well I just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets. It was an excellent movie even though I could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing. And I never in a million years would have guessed the reason why <PERSON>Alissia</PERSON> had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth. This was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I've experienced that same pain that <PERSON>Alissia</PERSON> was feeling. I too would not have sought out this movie, but I'm sure glad I saw it. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love a good drama or tear-jerker.
102 0 this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.
103 1 Busy is so amazing! I just loved every word she has ever done- freaks and geeks, <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s creek, white chicks, the smokers. after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day. i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. if someone hasn't saw is excellent movie than don't waist more time and go see it now. i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies. i saw busy in the late night show with <PERSON>Conan</PERSON> and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her! everybody who saw the movie- in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful! you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine (maxim) she looks so good there! ~DANIELLE~
104 0 I was excited to view a CataluÃ±aÂ´s film in the BerlinÂ´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> about Catholicism . But what Mr <PERSON>Villaronga</PERSON> try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the filmÂ´s history. It is really a pity to see <PERSON>Angela Molina</PERSON> in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.
105 1 This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, watch it. Although, a warning, you'll cry your eyes out. I do, every time I see it, and I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you've seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie, and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting, amazing plot, and heart-wrenching dialogue. Very tense, very moving. Doesn't give all the answers, but makes many good points about humankind
106 0 I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. <PERSON>Francisca</PERSON> is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramallo</PERSON>, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to <PERSON>Almodovar</PERSON> fans), is that with one exception (<PERSON>Francisca</PERSON>) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a "potboiler" is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.
107 1 Home Room really surprised me. In comparison to other movies that were written regarding <ORGANIZATION>Columbine</ORGANIZATION> high school this one is the best. Home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town. The movie focus' on two opposite characters., <PERSON>Alecia</PERSON>(<PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>(<PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON>). <PERSON>Alecia</PERSON> is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting. She seems to show no emotion about it. <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. <PERSON>Alecia</PERSON> is forced to visit <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> at the hospital in order to graduate. Meanwhile the police are investigating <PERSON>Alecia</PERSON> as she might have known the shooting was going to happen. <PERSON>Alecia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> are very different and do not get along at first. Eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends. (very much in the style of the breakfast club). Home Room Beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
108 0 The only good thing about this movie was the shot of <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of <PERSON>Nina Hartley</PERSON>. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> was in the '80s. <PERSON>Kurt Russell</PERSON> must have had a fun life.
109 1 Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial.<br /><br />*Spoilers* The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident, played by a very young <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Busy Philipps</PERSON>.<br /><br />The two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues.<br /><br /><PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON>, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting. Busy <PERSON>Philipps</PERSON>, three years older than <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON> and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence. This girl was the part.<br /><br />It's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. <PERSON>Gus van Sant</PERSON>'s Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.<br /><br />Ten out of Ten
110 0 There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and "The Man who Fell to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the "hillarious" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by <PERSON>Goldie</PERSON> winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON>'s. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.
111 1 At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so I looked it up on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I would give it a try expecting a movie like Elephant.<br /><br />Once I got past the fact that I am supposed to dislike the <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> character played excellently by <PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON>, I realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is so mean to <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> played by <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting. They share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses.<br /><br />I've just got to say how much I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it. I couldn't even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the <ORGANIZATION>Columbine</ORGANIZATION> tragedy. This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Busy <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> acting is OFF the CHAIN!!! That is a good thing and I would love to see her progress into some more mature roles.
112 0 Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. Only Hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...<br /><br />
113 1 This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. <br /><br />If this film had been directed by <PERSON>Larry Clark</PERSON>, then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place.<br /><br />Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting, and how it effected the victims who survived.<br /><br />I had seen <PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON> in other films before, but her performance in this movie is by far, her best. The only other movie that I've seen with <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> is "Swim Fan" which made me almost not want to watch this film, but she turned in a very good performance herself.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies I have seen that was actually able to make me cry. Trust me when I tell you, that doesn't happen very often.<br /><br />Home Room is a beautiful film, and that's all there is too it...
114 0 What does the " Executive producer " do in a movie . If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . You might notice in a great number of movies starring <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> that he is also the executive producer which meant <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> himself raised the money since he is a major player . Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies " starring <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch <br /><br />PROTOCOL follows the saga of one <PERSON>Sunny Davis</PERSON> a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . Likely ? As things progress Ms <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ( Who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . When I say that PROTOCOL stars <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? Exactly
115 1 I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I was bored and looked through the t.v. and found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 min., but I got hooked. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in anyone's life. I give it a 10, more if possible. The director/ writer and actors did an amazing job. I think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery, and more. I cried for hours! I think that the director/ writer should write more movies like this one. I loved it! I didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I wish it could go in the movies for more people to see.
116 0 When an attempt is made to assassinate the Emir of <LOCATION>Ohtar</LOCATION>, an Arab potentate visiting <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named <PERSON>Sunny Davis</PERSON>. Sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the Protocol Section of the <ORGANIZATION>United States Department of State</ORGANIZATION>. Unknown to her however, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda.<br /><br />A map we see shows Ohtar lying on the borders of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Yemen</LOCATION>, in an area of barren desert known as the <LOCATION>Rub al-Khali</LOCATION>, or Empty Quarter. In real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero, and virtually zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that <PERSON>Ohtar</PERSON> is of immense strategic importance in the Cold War and that the American government, who are keen to build a military base there, need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. It transpires that the Emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>; they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem. Sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the Emir has further opportunities to meet her.<br /><br />A plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire, but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down. Possibly in 1984 the American public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy; this was, after all, the year in which <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the Presidential election and his hard line with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was clearly going down well with the voters. (If the film had been made a couple of years later, in the wake of the Iran/Contra affair, its tone might have been different).<br /><br />The film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. Sunny is a typical Goldie character- pretty, sweet-natured, naive and not too bright. There is, however, a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone, and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. (Actually, that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one). <PERSON>Goldie</PERSON> tries her best to save this one, but never succeeds. Part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. On the one hand Sunny is a sweet, innocent country girl from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>. On the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. The effect is rather like imagining <PERSON>Rebecca</PERSON> of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl.<br /><br />The more important reason why <PERSON>Goldie</PERSON> is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material, and "Protocol" is simply unfunny. Whatever humour exists is tired and strained, relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men who, apparently, all lust after Western women, particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed. There was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties, as this was the period which also saw the awful <PERSON>Ben Kingsley</PERSON>/ <PERSON>Nastassia Kinski</PERSON> film "Harem", about a lascivious Middle Eastern ruler who kidnaps a young American woman, and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. The film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day "Mr <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>". Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about Democracy and the Constitution and the Citizen's Duty to Vote and We The People and how the Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance blah blah blahÂ…Â…, but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies, such as "Cactus Flower", "Overboard" and ""Housesitter", but "Protocol" is not one of them. I have not seen all of her films, but of those I have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst. 3/10
117 1 Caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels, and was so intrigued I sought out the next showing.<br /><br />I really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed. It also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's, a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days.<br /><br />The fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot. To see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming. And will admit that I shed quite a few tears throughout.<br /><br />On the whole, not a movie that I would seek out to what, however I am sure glad I did see it.
118 0 Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and <ORGANIZATION>Goldie</ORGANIZATION>'s charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.
119 1 While i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem. I don't know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right.<br /><br />The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle. Thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on.<br /><br />I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a performance by <PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON> and <PERSON>Erkia Christensen</PERSON> not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all a excellent movie.
120 0 I like <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at <ORGANIZATION>Walmart</ORGANIZATION> I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!
121 1 "Home Room" like "Zero Day" and "Elephant", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers.<br /><br />Don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes, it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected "Hill Street Blues" episode. It is lame but bear with it, at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. I recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film.<br /><br />Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as <PERSON>Paul F. Ryan</PERSON> was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features. Because the script of "Home Room" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen.<br /><br /><PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (<PERSON>Sarah McLaughlin</PERSON>'s "Sweet Surrender") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final minute.<br /><br />The other strength of the film is the casting of <PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON> (<PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> (<PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>) as the main protagonists. Although <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> plays her standard alienated surly teen and <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON> her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>. What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> to the lone shooter. If they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed.<br /><br />A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> could have easily steered this film into clichÃ© and predictability. But instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match, slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside themselves. <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>'s "I'm dying inside" line just tears you apart-I can't think of a moment in any other film that I felt as intensely as that one. She desperately needs a connection that <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> just as desperately resists. <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> only makes progress when she retreats. The viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen.<br /><br />Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
122 0 There's not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this alleged comedy <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s sole ironic moment. <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question "how long did vaudeville last, anyway?"). <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director <PERSON>Herbert Ross</PERSON> only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s screenplays; here, <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> and <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give "The Sunshine Boys" some sunniness, yet <PERSON>Walter</PERSON> continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****
123 1 Alright, this film is the representation of several things. For starters, this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students. One student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries. The lead character is what several people who consider a 'loner/goth', despite the movie's stating of her not being so. She seems quite mysterious, but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom. She's questioned, due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before. Anyhow, she's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society. Yet, due to some, at first unexplained events, she spent roughly a year out of school, failing the grade. She has the desire to graduate, and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor, the girl in the hospital.<br /><br />These two leads are nearly entirely opposite, and they are quite that on a social level. While <PERSON>Alisha</PERSON> is a quiet, inwardly disturbed, anti-social 'goth' girl who spends her time entirely alone (even though she seems to read quite often, somewhat of a closet/out of the closet bookworm), the other girl is a rich, popular 'bubbly' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world, ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive. I feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing MOST 'cliques' in the modern highschool, but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other. While the injured girl learns a deep, meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world, <PERSON>Alisha</PERSON> learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing.<br /><br />Many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things. Either, a snobby, hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does, taking it out on an innocent girl, OR the story of a seemingly trapped, fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge, but that she is actually, perhaps, one of the most intelligent people she's known. In other words, people may see this film as a focus on <PERSON>Alisha</PERSON> teaching the other girl a lesson about life, but it isn't about that.<br /><br />This film is about SEVERAL things. While it is about all I have stated, it is also representative of how people deal from a large, life-changing catastrophe. Truly, this movie is not very symbolic, but instead incredibly straight forward with its message, as long as you aren't afraid to open your mind, and your heart, to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously.<br /><br />Overall, this film is one of the best I've ever seen. The acting is brilliant, the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful, and the emotion flowing through-out this film will have anyone not only relating, but possibly crying. This film is by far heart-wrenching, and very impactful, and if I ever believed any film could alter a person's life... this would be the first that could have changed mine.<br /><br />I adored this movie, if you ever want a movie that's moving and impactful, while incredibly entertaining and REAL, watch this.
124 0 SWING! is an important film because it's one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old <ORGANIZATION>Cotton Club</ORGANIZATION>--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of <LOCATION>Black America</LOCATION> that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!
125 1 I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion, and felt so real, I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry. I can really identify with Busy <PERSON>Phillip</PERSON>'s character, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me.<br /><br />I think that all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everybody and anybody. Especially those who have been affected by any school shooting.<br /><br />It truly is one of the greatest movies of all time.
126 0 Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON>'s character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack
127 1 This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny. If you think of seeing this one for the shootings.. stay clear. This one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure. Even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do...WHY? Fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with. Yes the language is harsh at times, but it suits the characters well. There are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all movies have these. The major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
128 0 This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by <PERSON>Robert DuVall</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, <PERSON>Robert DuVall</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how <PERSON>Robert DuVall</PERSON> portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.
129 1 This is <PERSON>Paul F. Ryan</PERSON>'s first and only full-length feature. He hasn't done anything since. However, he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story. I don't know when or why the idea emerged in his head, but <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie, "Home room".<br /><br />Busy <PERSON>Philipps</PERSON> carries the movie on her shoulders as <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>, a troubled girl; the ones we always see in television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a package of cigarettes in the pocket, weird look and disturbing eyes (with makeup, of course). An event has occurred at her school; a shooting. Some students have died, and she saw everything. Now Detective <PERSON>Martin Van Zandt</PERSON> (<PERSON>Victor Garber</PERSON>) is investigating the case, and, as expected, <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is a suspect. But the shooting is just the genesis; the movie is not about the shooting.<br /><br />Lying in bed in a hospital room is <PERSON>Deanna Cartwright</PERSON> (<PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON>). She is one of the survivors of the hospital. The script establishes a bond between them, by the school Principal (<PERSON>James Pickens Jr</PERSON>). He is helping all the students to recover from the event, but <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> doesn't seem to care. She's isolated. So the Principal punishes her; she needs to visit <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> every day until five o' clock. Then the movie starts.<br /><br />I can't even describe how wonderfully written I think the movie is. I can identify with the characters and the situations they live; I like reality. These things could happen to anyone. And the things they say are totally understandable. They're growing up and trying to deal with things they haven't experienced; they're doing their best. Without knowing it, <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> (when she visits <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> for the first time) and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> (when she sees <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> standing in front of her) are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high school.<br /><br />The director leads <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Philipps</PERSON> through their roles very well. Look the contrast between them. <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> seems naive and with plain thoughts; no complexity inside of her mind. When <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks: "Who has brought them?". "Many people", <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> answers; although some days later we learn they're from her parents, who come every week. The parental figures are all well represented, but are not as important as their sons' characters. <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> is lonely. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> seems mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking roughly. But after two days of visiting, she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day; even sleeping in <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>'s room all night. When they both have a fight afterwards, I believe <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> says: "Why do you keep coming back?". <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is lonely too.<br /><br />The ending of the movie, without ruining it, comes a bit disappointing; it's something I wasn't waiting for. It eliminates some of the strength the movie has. The revelation comes totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax the movie could have had. It was an excellent script anyway; and an excellent direction. A damn fine movie.<br /><br />When it comes to <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON>, this was the role she needed to fly higher. Her role in "Traffic" was impressing, but this was the big step; the main role. Maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film, and that's a pity. She hasn't made one false move since then. She has even come out with good performances in awful movies. On the other hand, <PERSON>Busy Philipps</PERSON>, who proved to be very promising in this movie (what a transformation), hasn't got many opportunities for other roles.<br /><br />The same I say about <PERSON>Paul F. Ryan</PERSON> (in directing, of curse), and I expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script; I'm waiting for his next movie. I'm hoping the best for all of them.
130 0 I don't quite get the rating for The <ORGANIZATION>Amati Girls</ORGANIZATION> and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichÃ©s in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
131 1 This film isn't just about a school shooting, in fact its never even seen. But that just adds to the power this film has. Its about people and how they deal with tragedy. I know it was shown to the students who survived the <ORGANIZATION>Columbine</ORGANIZATION> shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them. The acting is superb. All three main actors (<ORGANIZATION>Busy Phillips</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Victor Garber</PERSON>) are excellent in their roles...I highly recommend this film to anyone. Its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it. It provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It is a tear-jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
132 0 I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director <PERSON>Gregor Jordan</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Soldiers</ORGANIZATION>). Basically <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> (<PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON>) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent <PERSON>Francis Hare</PERSON> (<PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON>), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> as <PERSON>Joseph Byrne</PERSON>, <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> as <PERSON>Julia Cook</PERSON>, <PERSON>Laurence Kinlan</PERSON> as <PERSON>Dan Kelly</PERSON>, <PERSON>Philip Barantini</PERSON> as <PERSON>Steve Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joel Edgerton</PERSON> as <PERSON>Aaron Sherritt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kiri Paramore</PERSON> as Constable <PERSON>Fitzpatrick</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kerry Condon</PERSON> as <PERSON>Kate Kelly</PERSON>, <PERSON>Emily Browning</PERSON> as <PERSON>Grace Kelly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rachel Griffiths</PERSON> as <PERSON>Susan Scott</PERSON>. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!
133 1 "Home Room" came as a total surprise. Not having a clue as to what it was all about, it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates, who are the innocent victims of his rash actions.<br /><br /><PERSON>Paul Ryan</PERSON>, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.<br /><br /><PERSON>Alicia Browning</PERSON> is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school. She has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students. For one, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect.<br /><br />What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy, as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. <PERSON>Deanna Cartwright</PERSON> is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school, at all. When a ricochet bullet hit her, she is hospitalized with more than a wound. She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget.<br /><br /><PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows. <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> dislikes <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>, but in a matter of days, both girls will make peace. We don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school.<br /><br />Busy <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> makes an excellent <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Erika Christiansen</PERSON> is equally good as <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>. <PERSON>Victor Garber</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Pinkins</PERSON>, <PERSON>Taylor Holland</PERSON>, and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble.<br /><br />The film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that Mr. <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> wanted to give this movie.
134 0 From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.
135 1 The industry dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens. Had people had an opportunity to see this, work of mouth would have made it very successful. The 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters. I checked this out based on the rave recommendation <PERSON>Richard Roeper</PERSON> or (<PERSON>Ebert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roeper</PERSON>) in his book. An example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens. Which gave it no chance to be seen. Some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good. This is Oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it. Maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on DVD or cable. If you haven't see this movie you should. Great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie. It could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films. Girl Interrupted comes to mind. If you like that you will like this. <br /><br />Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic. Even though <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is angry and <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic. The movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school. <PERSON>Erica</PERSON> is even better in this than in Traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine. See this movie and if you like, recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 tops records. What kind of word are we living in? AGHhh. So to make the world right again see this and recommend it.
136 0 Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Also <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time
137 1 Why a stupid, boring, crappy overrated film series like "Star Wars" gets all the hype, and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un-noticed.. is beyond me... This movie will really open your eyes to the dark, disturbing, sad, and scary world we live in...<br /><br />Unlike the boring "Elephant", this movie isn't one of those "just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger" movies.. this movie focuses more on what happens AFTER the event...<br /><br /><PERSON>Deana</PERSON>, played by the very hot and very talented <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON>, is a happy and healthy straight-A student with great friends and a great life... until... she is injured on the day of the shooting, by being shot in the head.. Luckily she is not killed, but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while, causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain, in addition to the physical...<br /><br />Meanwhile, <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON>, played by the also very gorgeous and talented <PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON>, is a nasty, cold-hearted, rebellious, anti-social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait on her... and she is unharmed when the shooting happens.. because it turns out, she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did... which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions.. When she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen, they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something... and she still doesn't, so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students, and after she walks out on that... the principal decides enough is enough, and forces her to go visit <PERSON>Deana</PERSON> in the hospital.. Of course she refuses this too, but the principal says that if <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> doesn't do this, the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something.. and so she actually goes to see her...<br /><br />The lonely, traumatized, and both physically and emotionally wounded <PERSON>Deana</PERSON> is more than happy to have someone visit her, but of course, <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> is anything BUT happy to be seeing her.. <PERSON>Deana</PERSON> attempts to give her a friendly welcome, but of course, <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced, and has no intention of being friendly with her at all. But sooner or later, that intention will change... (and that's all I'll say :) This is truly one of the most moving movies ever, as well as one of the most dark and disturbing.. Actually, I think I would tie this with "American History X" as equally disturbing and moving at the same time...<br /><br />WARNING: Watch this movie at your own risk!! It contains VERY graphic scenes and images! EXCELLENT and criminally under-appreciated movie! I feel so ashamed that I'm pretty much the only one that knows about it!
138 0 I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the <PERSON>Mick Jagger</PERSON> version, but not by much.
139 1 I was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time I even thought going to bed, something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime.<br /><br />This movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film, but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings. And even better, the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out, a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie. This film not only doesn't follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards.<br /><br />I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from <LOCATION>Columnbine</LOCATION> who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON> popped them every time the nightmares started. Up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have. It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film, having a relative who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses. Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues. And for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital (I don't want to tell any particulars), you're dead wrong on that too - I've been there. The script was so real it was amazing.<br /><br />Go BUY this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late. Someday they'll thank you for it.
140 0 This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with <ORGANIZATION>Bloom</ORGANIZATION>, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.
141 1 What a surprise; two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film. This is the best work <PERSON>Busy Phillips</PERSON> has ever done and the best from <PERSON>Erika Christensen</PERSON> since Traffic. This film certainly should be in Oscar contention. See this movie!
142 0 This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON>) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though <PERSON>Heath</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> are lovely to look at.
143 1 I couldn't believe the comments made about the movie.<br /><br />As I read the awful opinions about the movie I actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that I did.<br /><br />What I viewed was incredible! I think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie.<br /><br />I hadn't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and I couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did I'd have to say its the most believable movie that I've seen in a long time. <br /><br />What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with <PERSON>Deanna</PERSON>'s choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene, from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice. That I don't understand, its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error I fail to see. I think it was a real believable movie that I would see again and recommend. Opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded. I hope to see any of the actors soon I think that all played great roles.<br /><br />Busy <PERSON>Philipps</PERSON> will be the highest paid actress someday and I hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her! You Go Girl!
144 0 If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to "Ned Kelly" as an "Australian Western." For the people Down Under, <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jesse James</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clyde</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Butch Cassidy</PERSON> and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, his brother <PERSON>Dan</PERSON>, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.<br /><br />Perhaps because we've encountered this "gentleman bandit" scenario so many times in the past, "Ned Kelly" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichÃ©s on its way to the inevitable showdown. <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON> plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.<br /><br /><PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.<br /><br />"Ned Kelly" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.
145 1 I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays <PERSON>Don Gallico</PERSON>, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely <PERSON>Eva Gabor</PERSON>). Even though Price is a murderer, I actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him.<br /><br />Although this movie doesn't have the "horror" factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, "House of Wax") it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. <br /><br />This is a must for <ORGANIZATION>Vincent Price</ORGANIZATION> fans.
146 0 This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br /><PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br /><PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br /><PERSON>Rachel Griffiths</PERSON> was her usual fabulous self, but <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON> looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. <PERSON>Heath</PERSON> and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from <PERSON>Monty Python</PERSON> and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say "I'll bite yer leg off!" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.
147 1 This is essentially a variation on House Of Wax ,in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies ,<PERSON>Vincent Price.In</PERSON> both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other,less talented and less scrupulous people .In this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist ,the <PERSON>Great Rinaldo</PERSON> (<PERSON>John Emery</PERSON>)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs.Price is already ill disposed towards <PERSON>Rinaldi</PERSON> as his former wife is now a paramour of <PERSON>Rinaldi</PERSON>. He deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon <PERSON>Rinaldi</PERSON> and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer.<br /><br />Price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy.The rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on Price who carries the burden with ease .<br /><br />Good solid B Movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece .Shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
148 0 They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets <PERSON>Butch Cassidy</PERSON> and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON> story, not the Arthurian legends, not <PERSON>Beowulf</PERSON>, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> was hanged. <br /><br />So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> story. Having recently read <PERSON>Peter Carey</PERSON>'s excellent novel "The True History of the <ORGANIZATION>Kelly Gang</ORGANIZATION>" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that <PERSON>Mick Jagger</PERSON>'s much derided 1970 <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
149 1 Basically the exact same movie as "House of Wax" - <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON>'s first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because "The Mad Magician" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-D effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! "Never change a winning team" is exactly what writer <PERSON>Crane Wilbur</PERSON> must have thought when he penned down Price's character <PERSON>Don Gallico</PERSON>, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. <PERSON>Don Gallico</PERSON> is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON> the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled "The Girl and the Buzz Saw". <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON>'s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer <PERSON>Ross Ormond</PERSON> appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON>'s inventions are the rightful property of the company. The sleazy and relentless <PERSON>Ormond</PERSON>, who by the way also ransacked <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON>'s once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON>'s rival The Great <PERSON>Rinaldi</PERSON>. Inevitably <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON> snaps and sadistically butchers <PERSON>Ormond</PERSON>, but Â– also being a master of creating disguises Â– recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life. "The Mad Magician" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in Grand Guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). The 3-D delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50's hype, but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. "The Mad Magician" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of <PERSON>Alice Prentiss</PERSON> is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. Needless to state that <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. Like no other actor could ever accomplish, Price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. You pity <PERSON>Don Gallico</PERSON>, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. You support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.
150 0 <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON>, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.<br /><br />I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, `Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of <PERSON>Costner</PERSON>'s awful <PERSON>Wyatt Earp</PERSON> all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of `Who has the stupidest beard?', `Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The <ORGANIZATION>History Channel</ORGANIZATION>, Discovery Channel, and <PERSON>Neighbours</PERSON> whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).<br /><br />This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isn't even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!
151 1 The great <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> has done many fantastic Horror films, some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time. Price's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s, with films such as <PERSON>Roger Corman</PERSON>'s brilliant Poe-cycle (still the greatest Horror cycle of all-time), <PERSON>Michael Reeves</PERSON>' "Witchfinder General" (1968) or <PERSON>Ubaldo Ragona</PERSON>'s "The Last Man on Earth" (1964) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career. The films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal Horror icon he is, however date back to the 50s, with "House of Wax" (1953) marking his rise to stardom. "The Mad Magician" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor. This is not to say, however, that this film isn't an original, delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself. As the lines above may suggest, <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> is my favorite actor, and, while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in, none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.<br /><br />Price stars as <PERSON>Don Galico</PERSON> (aka. Galico the Great), an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices, whose boss, a sleazy businessman, stole his wife (<PERSON>Eva Gabor</PERSON>) from him. When the boss takes away one of <PERSON>Galico</PERSON>'s ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival, The <PERSON>Great Rinaldi</PERSON> (<PERSON>John Emery</PERSON>), <PERSON>Galico</PERSON> snaps, and a murderous spree of revenge begins...<br /><br />Don't we love <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> when he's out for revenge? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as "The Abominable Dr. <PERSON>Phibes</PERSON>" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders, and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as <ORGANIZATION>Vincent Price</ORGANIZATION> does. This film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for Price, who, as always, delivers a brilliant performance, and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every Horror fan. Another must-see for my fellow Price fans.
152 0 I saw this at the premiere in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION><br /><br />It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt <PERSON>Gregor Jordan</PERSON> could sit back and say to himself "this is the best I could have done with the material".<br /><br /><PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen.<br /><br />Such is life.
153 1 <ORGANIZATION>Vincent Price</ORGANIZATION>'s follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitter Â– albeit resourceful Â– showman. Though a remake, the former (shot in Technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from some resistible comic relief, the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head?), this offers more than enough Grand Guignol-type thrills and overall camp value (Price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on its own two feet. Incidentally, director <PERSON>Brahm</PERSON>'s involvement here proves no mere coincidence Â– since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles (both starring <PERSON>Laird Cregar</PERSON>) he had previously helmed i.e. THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young leads are played by <PERSON>Mary Murphy</PERSON> (as Price's ingÃ©nue assistant) and <PERSON>Patrick O'Neal</PERSON> (as her police detective boyfriend Â– curiously enough, he would himself take the lead in a similar piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one). An interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial in bringing about Price's downfall (in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax)Â…though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run! Watching the star in a made-to-measure role, the film emerges a good deal of fun Â– particularly at a compact 73 minutes.
154 0 I saw this film opening weekend in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, <PERSON>Edgerton</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bloom</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Watts</PERSON> and Rush that the definitive story of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were some other plus points, the support acting from <PERSON>Edgerton</PERSON> in particular, assured direction from <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and selling the picture in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. Oh well, at least <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...<br /><br />Guess I will just have to content myself with <PERSON>Peter Carey</PERSON>'s excellent "Secret History of the Kelly Gang". 4/10
155 1 The film begins with <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON> about to begin his performance as a magician. However, mid-way through the very successful show, the police come and shut him down. It seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks Price had created--even those he made on his own time at home. As a result, Price justifiably kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Price killed and most probably thought this was a GOOD thing, because Price was a bit mad, he just couldn't stop at one (sort of like eating Lay's Potato Chips).<br /><br />The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great plot twists as well as exciting action. One thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull. While it's also far from subtle, it is fun throughout, though and well worth a look.<br /><br />Had I never seen Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9. That's because while THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful film, it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was re-hashed in the follow-up film. Both were made in 3-D, both have a plot where Price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch. The biggest differences, and there are few, are that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror film and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery.<br /><br />My advice is to see this film AND HOUSE OF WAX (the Price version only). They are both terrific 1950s horror films.
156 0 The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.
157 1 Even though it has one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots," this film is my favorite of <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON>'s work. <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON> has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability. When you watch it, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance, even though he frightens you a little with his original fury. As the film goes on, his character becomes tragic. He's committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover that up. And again to cover that one up. And again... your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. Even if the revenge story is of old, the plot devices themselves are original- <PERSON>Gallico</PERSON> uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. A shame this one isn't available for home veiwing.
158 0 The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about <PERSON>Japp</PERSON> having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.
159 1 I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It is too bad that <PERSON>Lydia Reed</PERSON> has decided to be forgotten and not appear. She was excellent in the show. Of course <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> was great as well as <PERSON>Tony MartÃ­nez</PERSON>. I loved it when he called Amos SeÃ±or Grampa.I have purchased Season I on DVD and I cannot wait to buy Seasons 2-6.If only there would be more shows on television like this one, everything would be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless all the departed members of the cast and please,<PERSON>Llydia Reed</PERSON>, make yourself known again to the public. You are loved and respected. The Real Mc Coys will live forever.
160 0 I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. <PERSON>Deedee Pfieffer</PERSON>'s performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played <PERSON>Lori</PERSON> did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.
161 1 I really enjoyed the reunion a lot! I would have rated it a 10 if they had had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance.<br /><br />Anyway, I was glad that <ORGANIZATION>TNN</ORGANIZATION> ran the series again! I had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). <PERSON>Jenny Hanahan</PERSON>
162 0 Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.
163 1 I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see <PERSON>Richard Crenna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathleen Nolan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tony Martinez</PERSON>!!!To see them now was wonderful, because I always watched the show growing up so when the TV said that there was going to be a reunion I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out is why <PERSON>Lydia Reed</PERSON> (<PERSON>Hassie McCoy</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Michael Winkelman</PERSON>(little <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>) was not on there.I know that <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> had died. So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to <PERSON>Lydia Reed</PERSON>( <PERSON>Hassie McCoy</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Michael Winkelman</PERSON> (little <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> I would be thankful!!! I have searched everywere and no luck .The only thing I could find out about <PERSON>Michael Winkelman</PERSON> is he was supposed to be born in 1946. This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned.The shows today dont have that.The whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them So since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do!!! Thank You <PERSON>Glenda</PERSON>
164 0 This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get "terrorized" by this pathetic "crazed killer", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.
165 1 Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans (most likely all Baby Boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show, in 2000. <PERSON>Tony Martinez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Crenna</PERSON> both died shortly thereafter. As enjoyable as it was to see Luke, <PERSON>Sugar-Babe</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Pepino</PERSON> together again, it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of <PERSON>Lydia Reed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Winkleman</PERSON>? It is my understanding that <PERSON>Little Luke</PERSON> had passed away in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information about <PERSON>Hassie</PERSON> on the internet, that I can find. Very curious why they were not even mentioned? It was so conspicuous, their absence from the Reunion show, that I suspect that the family of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> herself (if still alive) either, 1) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) <ORGANIZATION>TNN</ORGANIZATION> could not find any trace of either <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> or <PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> (like the rest of us), they seemed to have vanished. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together.<br /><br />Otherwise, the retrospect on <PERSON>Walter Brennen</PERSON> was wonderfully done. They made no bones about it ... it was Grandpa who made the show such a success. I remember, as a child, mimicking Grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing (as I'm sure a million other children did back then). One annoyance that did bother me a bit, was the tendency for <PERSON>Richard Crenna</PERSON> to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting <PERSON>Tony</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathleen</PERSON> to make a point. In fact, although <PERSON>Tony Martinez</PERSON> seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunate, since I wanted to hear from all three, equally. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I've watched it on DVD several times and have enjoyed it each time.<br /><br />Dodgerdude

167 1 A few years ago I added a comment to the <ORGANIZATION>IMDB</ORGANIZATION> on "The Real McCoys" TV series. I said then and repeat now it was a charming, funny, and entertaining show, well-acted with wonderful characterizations.<br /><br />I recently saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS the Reunion of 2000 with <PERSON>Richard Crenna</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kathy Nolan</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Tony Martinez</PERSON>. As another writer here mentioned, it is curious that <PERSON>Lydia Reed</PERSON> (<PERSON>Hassie</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Michael Winkelman</PERSON> (Little Luke) weren't refered to, but perhaps they can be tracked down via SAG or <ORGANIZATION>AFTRA</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br />The reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. One piece of inside information we did NOT get was whether or not <PERSON>Kathy Nolan</PERSON> regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute, which left <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> a "widow" in it's last year, which wasn't very good. <PERSON>Nolan</PERSON> went on to do a bomb of a comedy called "Broadside", about women nurses in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> in WW II. Get it? BROADside? No, not funny.<br /><br />Unlike the sleazy, salacious, and violent TRASH on TV now that is so undermining our values, "The Real McCoys" entertained with decent values and fine human beings. And I thank all involved, including the creator, <PERSON>Irving Pinkus</PERSON>, for having brought it to my family. We never missed it.
168 0 As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.
169 1 I used this film in a religion class I was teaching. The golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy has been given money to buy milk. On the way home, he stops at carnival to play a game. Next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary. The boy drops the bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what is happening at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He(?) discovers the fish bowl and watches it. The fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl. By now, a bunch of teenagers in my class and I have fallen in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. The double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. It was a great discussion starter in my class.
170 0 WARNING: This review contains SPOILERS. Do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film.<br /><br />With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' <PERSON>Greydon Clark</PERSON>, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.'<br /><br />The film is set in a small town in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see <PERSON>Vincent Schiavelli</PERSON>, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, <PERSON>Raymond Burr</PERSON>, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy <PERSON>Jan-Michael Vincent</PERSON> comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after <PERSON>Vincent</PERSON> wards off the locals and informs <PERSON>Shepherd</PERSON> that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, <PERSON>Vincent Schiavelli</PERSON>, with his killer dog at his side, is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item. You know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at Halloween, the kind that you shake to make them glow? <PERSON>Schiavelli</PERSON> uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people. It's the second-worst effect in the movie. Every time <PERSON>Schiavelli</PERSON> is on screen with the glow stick, the scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement. It ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is.<br /><br />And what does all this lead up to? It's hard to tell when the final, confusing scene arrives. See, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that Shepherd found as some kind of `calling card,' but none of it makes sense. Why do Shepherd and <PERSON>Vincent</PERSON> age and <PERSON>Schiavelli</PERSON> does not? <PERSON>Schiavelli</PERSON> explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants <PERSON>Shepherd</PERSON> dead, but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it. I mean, why doesn't he kill <PERSON>Jan-Michael Vincent</PERSON>? After all, he had twenty-five years to do it. And the aliens won't need him if <PERSON>Shepherd</PERSON> is dead anyhow, so why try to kill her? Speaking of the aliens, it is never clear what they really wanted out of Shepherd and <PERSON>Vincent</PERSON>. What is their goal? Why do they wait so long to intervene? How could they be so sure Shepherd would come back? Not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made `The Return' any more pleasant. You would still have bad lines, really bad acting, particularly by <PERSON>Shepherd</PERSON>, cheesy effects, and poor direction. Luckily, the stars escaped from this movie. Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in `Moonlighting' with <PERSON>Bruce Willis</PERSON>. <PERSON>Jan-Michael Vincent</PERSON> went on to be featured in dozens of B-movies, often in over-the-top parts. <PERSON>Raymond Burr</PERSON> made a pile of <ORGANIZATION>Perry Mason</ORGANIZATION> television movies right up until his death. <PERSON>Vincent Schiavelli</PERSON> went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films. <PERSON>Martin Landau</PERSON>, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made the terrific `Alone in the Dark' and the awful `The Being' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently. You can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to `The Return.' <PERSON>Zantara</PERSON>'s score: 2 out of 10.
171 1 I saW this film while at <ORGANIZATION>Birmingham Southern College</ORGANIZATION> in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream-like quality. The bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is away at school. A cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are, and begins to warily stalk his "prey." The boy begins his walk home from school, and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. The fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence, and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly walks over to the fish, gently picks him up with his paws, and returns him to his bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, none the wiser.<br /><br />The ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003.<br /><br />If you can find it, watch it -- you won't be disappointed! And if you *do* find it, let me know so I can get a copy, too!
172 0 As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to <PERSON>G. K. Chesterton</PERSON> or <PERSON>C. S. Lewis</PERSON> for some inspiration?
173 1 I remember seeing this in a the Salem movie theater (where I used to attend "Kiddie MatinÃ©e"s almost every Saturday) in <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> when I was a young boy and have never forgotten it. It simply amazed me and my friends. I do wish there were some way I could see it again! I have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail. I only recently discovered that it was a <PERSON>Cousteau</PERSON> film and that blew my mind even more. How the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding. The fish is ACTUALLY IN THE CAT'S MOUTH at one point, if I remember correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see it again I would be extremely grateful!
174 0 I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that <PERSON>Missy</PERSON>'s father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.
175 1 This Academy Award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre. Told completely without dialogue, it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open. After a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl. The fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited. As the cat comes very near to the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat catches the fish, drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy, not knowing what has happened, gets back. This was amazingly filmed with real animals; how <PERSON>Cousteau</PERSON> got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable. I only wish this film were available now for people to see; I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable.
176 0 I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if <PERSON>Michael Landon Jr.</PERSON>'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Missy</PERSON>; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.
177 1 This was one of the best movies I have seen. The movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, I found it to be exhilarating to watch.<br /><br />Some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction. However, when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters, there is no direction is life. I feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations.<br /><br />Most of the cast are newcomers to the industry. However, they all pulled it off very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately.<br /><br />I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control. This movie might just scare them enough to change their ways.
178 0 I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "Love's Abiding Joy." The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (<PERSON>Willie</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Missie</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, <PERSON>Scottie</PERSON> and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to <PERSON>Janette Oke</PERSON>, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish <PERSON>Michael Landon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jr</PERSON> and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!
179 1 To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it. That's how I watch movies whenever possible. No preconception. I thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something. I was wrong, kinda.<br /><br />Loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me. I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do.<br /><br />Another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but I beg to differ. These kinds of things DO happen. I'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". Really sorry but the reality of the WORLD is that they DO happen. The creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things turn out good, sometimes they turn out bad and such is life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
180 0 :Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three "Love" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> happened way to soon and <PERSON>Clarks</PERSON> appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between <LOCATION>Missie</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from <PERSON>Janette Oke</PERSON>'s writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON>'s death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if <PERSON>Clarks</PERSON> character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even <PERSON>Marty</PERSON> but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.
181 1 Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.<br /><br />I thought the movie was OK...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.<br /><br />Ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion.<br /><br />No...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. After all, who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /><br />Ah, the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house, with their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them? <br /><br />I hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
182 0 I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.
183 1 Generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie. However, I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell. For instance- What happened to Tristan's brother, <PERSON>Hayden</PERSON>? For all we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If there is.. I cant wait to see it.
184 0 Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.
185 1 This is no art-house film, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /><br />Lot's of beautiful people, t&a, and action. I found it very entertaining. It's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun film to watch! <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chace</PERSON> are funny too, which is just gravy. Definitely worth a rental.<br /><br />So in summary, I'd recommend checking it out for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)<br /><br />The villains are good too. <PERSON>Vinnie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Corey Large</PERSON>, the hatian guy from Heroes. Very nasty villains.
186 0 A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The <ORGANIZATION>Zombie Chronicles</ORGANIZATION> is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...
187 1 My first child was born the year this program came out, and I played the record album for the boys every Christmas thereafter. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families...it invariably becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVD's (made on DVD-R from video tapes, probably) for sale on <ORGANIZATION>eBay</ORGANIZATION>. The one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and DVD will stay in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
188 0 THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (<PERSON>Emmy Smith</PERSON>) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (<PERSON>Joseph Haggerty</PERSON>) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area.<br /><br />An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by <PERSON>Haggerty</PERSON>'s painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON>, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that <PERSON>Ed Wood</PERSON>'s movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON>' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.
189 1 I am a huge <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> fan. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later release. The later release is missing several songs though. I see that it has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale at $75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas Cd would be worth that much. To me no amount is worth selling this treasure. It is my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have either version. If anyone has one available please let me know. Thanks
190 0 You have to admire <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON> even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. <PERSON>Joe Haggerty</PERSON> gives a spirited and very funny performance as <PERSON>Ebenezer Jackson</PERSON> and its a credit to <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
191 1 yes i have a copy of it on VHS uncut in great condition that i transfered to DVD and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a Christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets Christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close.
192 0 ..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for <PERSON>Goddard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Antonioni</PERSON>, though, just skip this one.
193 1 I was reviewing some old VHS tapes I have and came across The TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together.This made me go to my computer and look it up to see if I could find a DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on DVD. The show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the record and the CD but I would love to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There is also a few other songs not put on the CD. As a Fan of <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> and of the <ORGANIZATION>Muppets</ORGANIZATION>, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you don't have the CD it is a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs taken from that show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on.
194 0 I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.
195 1 this was a favorite Christmas Special that I wish that they would release on vhs or dvd , since my 33 RPM got lost,and any cassettes I made are also long gone.<br /><br />I am not even a big <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> fan but was very impressed with the music , which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin ( esp Little St. <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> ! ) It also contained a few little known songs ( original ? ).<br /><br />Even though it was done at the end of the '70's this show had a timeless feel to it. Hoping to find a copy soon !!!
196 0 I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie are going to be bad.After not watching it for more than a year I finally watched it. what a pathetic movieÂ….<br /><br />I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie,but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie.<br /><br />Trust me when I say " this movie sucks" I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie, But it couldn't have cost more than $20 000 to produce this movie. all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera .about 15 people with no acting skills, a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people.<br /><br />In the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter (<PERSON>Tara Woodley</PERSON> )run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town. He are completely unharmed. They went to a supposed to be abandon house ,but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there. just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems.<br /><br />Then the supposed drunk man start telling <PERSON>Tara</PERSON> ghost/zombies stories.<br /><br />The fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.<br /><br />his story<br /><br />Sgt. <PERSON>Ben Draper</PERSON> let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion (I think this is what happens)after letting the poor soldier private <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ,<PERSON>Ben Draper</PERSON><br /><br />buries him in a shallow grave.<br /><br />But Sgt. <PERSON>Ben Draper</PERSON> are in for n big surprise. his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills Sgt. <PERSON>Ben Draper</PERSON> to take revenge on private <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>.(next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered) The soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf.<br /><br />The twist ending were so lame.<br /><br />Even if you like B HORROR movies, don't watch this movie
197 1 For me too, this Christmas special is one that I remember very fondly. In 1989, I snatched up the 2 CDs I found of the soundtrack recording, giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now, and I would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as I listen.<br /><br />It has been noted elsewhere that <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show, and they did more than one special together. The good rapport between <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here, in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages.
198 0 Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although <PERSON>Hardgore</PERSON> released some <PERSON>Fulci</PERSON> films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already.<br /><br />Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to <PERSON>Hardgore</PERSON> for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful, awful stuff. We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.
199 1 A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but I've been raised on <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track down a video of it on <ORGANIZATION>Ebay</ORGANIZATION>, so after listening to all the music for some 21 years, I got to see <PERSON>John</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Muppets</ORGANIZATION> in action for myself. If you ever get the chance, it's a lot of fun--great music, heart-warming and cheesy. It's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> actually took some heat for doing a show like this--I guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the Muppets, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can't track down the video, the soundtrack is worth it too. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> tunes as well.
200 0 OK its not the best film I've ever seen but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!! story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way.<br /><br />And <PERSON>Jebidia</PERSON> deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling.<br /><br />overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.
201 1 <PERSON>Scott Bartlett</PERSON>'s 'OffOn' is nine minutes of pure craziness. It is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. There's no story to speak of, but <PERSON>Bartlett</PERSON> uses images of nature Â– particularly the human face and form Â– to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in <PERSON>Stanley Kubrick</PERSON>'s '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),' and, indeed, <PERSON>Bartlett</PERSON>'s opening sequence of images Â– flashing colours before a close-up human eye Â– recalls <PERSON>Dave Bowman</PERSON>'s journey through the Stargate. The visuals are richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.<br /><br />There appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the <ORGANIZATION>National Film Registry</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Film Preservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION> give 1968 as the correct year. Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening. Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either! 'OffOn' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. I had a thought Â– and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation Â– that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense. Perhaps this is where <LOCATION>Mankind</LOCATION>, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.
202 0 Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON> atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for <PERSON>Emmy Smith</PERSON> who shows some promise. The camera "direction" needs serious reworking. And no more "hold the camera and run" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.<br /><br />Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.<br /><br />Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.
203 1 IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68. Doesn't really matter, except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first art works to merge the two apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction isn't really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful. Certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known.
204 0 My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying Â£1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Garrett Clancy</PERSON> 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br /><PERSON>Garrett Clancy</PERSON>, aka Sgt. <PERSON>Ben Draper</PERSON> wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: <PERSON>Owen Wilson</PERSON> watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH
205 1 I first heard about this film about 20 years ago when I was a kid in grade school(!), it just so happened that I was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entry for movies (or cinema, I don't remember), were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn. It really intrigued me, since it stood out the most on the page (it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it).<br /><br />About 18 or so years later, the public library here where I live had available for checkout the whole 4-DVD set of "Treasures of American Film Archives" released by the <ORGANIZATION>National Film Preservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. So when I was reading the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I could finally see the film! After viewing it, it slightly wasn't was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that's a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques <PERSON>Scott Bartlett</PERSON> used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short/experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me as well...
206 0 Without wishing to be a killjoy, <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON> is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichÃ©d films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for Â£1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.
207 1 when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie...<br /><br />First, cast specially <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tamer Karadagli</PERSON>; good enough...<br /><br />Film,very intelligence and interesting because ,cast have a lot of international specially European actor and actress like from <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russsia</LOCATION>...<br /><br />Second,Story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion...<br /><br />Third,Final chapter is not special or interesting,it's regular like other action movies...<br /><br />Finally,i recommend to watch this movie...And i hope You'll love it enjoy :D
208 0 En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer <PERSON>Garrett Clancy</PERSON> and director <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON> at making a zombie themed anthologyÂ—a nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with <PERSON>Joe Haggerty</PERSON>, as the tale-telling <PERSON>Ebenezer Jackson</PERSON>, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON>' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and <PERSON>Joe Castro</PERSON>'s cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).
209 1 This movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job. Im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a cafÃ© to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. <PERSON>Arnold vosloo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael madsen</PERSON> did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.
210 0 There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a <ORGANIZATION>Kia</ORGANIZATION> Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like <PERSON>Janet Margolin</PERSON> at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />
211 1 Gotta start with <PERSON>Ed Furlong</PERSON> on this one. You gotta. God bless this kid. $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life. He has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like <PERSON>Furlong</PERSON> is even acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON>. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like this in real life." Does <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON> even have to act? Just natural. <PERSON>Vosloo</PERSON> has obviously moved on from the type-casted Mummy guy. I think the biggest surprise to this film was <PERSON>Jordana Spiro</PERSON>'s performance. Her reactions are spot-on in this film. I battled if she was hot or not, but realized I would just like to see more of her. <br /><br />Not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films. But what I am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing. It's not just your standard robbers take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win in the end type of film. The twists keep on coming...and coming.<br /><br />The cafÃ© scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there. Not glossed over a bit. Think like Bourne Ultimatum "lite" style on some scenes in the cafÃ©.<br /><br />And for those <PERSON>Bo Bice</PERSON> fanatics out there - actor <PERSON>Curtis Wayne</PERSON> (who plays <PERSON>Karl</PERSON>) will make you do a double take. These guys are twins.<br /><br />As I watched I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town. Made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for International audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of. And some of them are smoking hot. <PERSON>Moncia Dean</PERSON>? Need I say more.
212 0 1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(<PERSON>Dir-Brad Sykes</PERSON>): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.
213 1 The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. The society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The atmosphere is astounding. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!
214 0 If the crew behind "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a "Twist Ending"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. <PERSON>Joe Haggerty</PERSON>, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the "reveal" as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />Only for zombie completists.
215 1 <ORGANIZATION>Lars Von Triers Europa</ORGANIZATION> is an extremely good film. How's that? <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did have with Europa. To me the whole film was like an experience even if I did see it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, REAL and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list. I also think it is perhaps the scariest, the most gothic and complete film around. All right there are other good ones too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.
216 0 Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called <ORGANIZATION>Brain Damage Films</ORGANIZATION>. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)
217 1 `Europa' (or, as it is also known, `Zentropa') is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a true feast for the eyes. The picture was a contender for a 1991's <LOCATION>Golden Palm</LOCATION> in Canners. The award went to <PERSON>Barton Fink</PERSON> (by <PERSON>Coen</PERSON> brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Here's an exercise in class: rent both films and be a judge for yourself.
218 0 I think I will make a movie next weekend. Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made this film fit it in. I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! Total crap!!! Who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!
219 1 This is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON> creates a noir atmosphere of post-war <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> utterly captivating. You get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits. The plot necessarily comes second, but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised. Just wonderful.
220 0 I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in '<PERSON>Robin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marian</PERSON>.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> appearance just prior to her homicide.<br /><br />There is nothing but idiocy between <PERSON>Gazzara</PERSON> and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow.<br /><br />Who could believe that there are even some of the same <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> environs that <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON> inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION>'s' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old <PERSON>Sinatra</PERSON> songs and the <PERSON>Gershwin</PERSON> song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you.<br /><br />'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>'s chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON>, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations.<br /><br /><PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON> was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON> called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like <PERSON>Lana Turner</PERSON> were infinitely more effective than is <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>. <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> took acting seriously even when she was bad. <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON> doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps her most perfect, if possibly not her best in many ways.<br /><br />And that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening. <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, who was truly pretty. Otherwise, critic <PERSON>David Thomson</PERSON>'s oft-used phrase 'losing his/her talent' never has made more sense.<br /><br /><PERSON>Ben Gazarra</PERSON> had lost all sex appeal by then, and so we have 2 films with <PERSON>Gazarra</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>--who could ask for anything less? <PERSON>Sandra Dee</PERSON>'s last, pitiful film 'Lost,' from 2 years later, a low-budget nothing, had more to it than this. At least Ms. <PERSON>Dee</PERSON> spoke in her own voice; by 1981, <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>'s accent just sounded silly; she'd go on to do the <LOCATION>PBS 'Gardens</LOCATION> of the World with <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>' and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through English gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about 'what I like most is when flowers go back to nature!' as in naturalized daffodils, but in an actual fictional movie, she just sounds ridiculous.<br /><br />To think that 'Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION>'s' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> one of the most beautiful women in the world--she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in 'My Fair Lady', matching <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> in several things and <PERSON>Delphine Seyrig</PERSON> in 'Last Year at <LOCATION>Marienbad</LOCATION>.' And then this! And her final brief role as the angel '<PERSON>Hap</PERSON>' in the <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> film 'Always' was just more of the lady stuff--corny, witless and stifling.<br /><br />I went to her memorial service at the <LOCATION>Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church</LOCATION>, a beautiful service which included a boys' choir singing the Shaker hymn 'Simple Gifts.' The only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>'s singing 'Moon River' on the fire escape in 'Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION>'s,' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation.<br /><br />A great lady who was once a fine actress (as in 'The Nun's Story') and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's who became a truly bad one--that's not all that common. And perhaps it is only a great human being who, in making such things as film performances trivial, nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly--which all of her late film work contained in abundance. Most of the talk about <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>'s miscasting is about 'My Fair Lady.' But the one that should have had the original actress in it was 'Wait Until Dark,' which had starred <PERSON>Lee Remick</PERSON> on <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>. Never as celebrated as <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>, she was a better actress in many ways (<PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON> was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON> was at least adequate enough in that part. After that, all of her acting went downhill.
221 1 This is the definite <PERSON>Lars von Trier Movie</PERSON>, my favorite, I rank it higher than "Breaking the waves" or the latest "Dancer in the Dark"... I simply love the beauty of the picture...the framing is so original; acting is wonderful, A MUST SEE.
222 0 My interest in <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>'s last movies. I'll always love <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.
223 1 Before Dogma 95: when <PERSON>Lars</PERSON> used movies as art, not just a story. A beautiful painting about love and death. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The color... The music... Just perfect.
224 0 This film is just plain horrible. <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. <PERSON>Patti Hansen</PERSON> delivers her lines with the passion of <PERSON>Ben Stein</PERSON>. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>'s kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
225 1 EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago. This film is truly unique, and a work of genius. The camerawork and the editing are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film, creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience.<br /><br />The participation of <PERSON>Barbara Suwkowa</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eddie Constantine</PERSON> in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> provides his great voice as the narrator.<br /><br />A one of a kind movie! Four stars (highest rating).
226 0 Today I found "They All Laughed" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of <PERSON>Peter Bogdanovich</PERSON>, <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> and specially <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in "<PERSON>Mick Martin</PERSON> & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and Â– wow Â– four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching "They All Laughed" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, are ridiculous. <PERSON>Ben Gazarra</PERSON> as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Antonio Banderas</PERSON> or <PERSON>George Clooney</PERSON>, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: The <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> Story"; the amazing beauty of the sexy <PERSON>Patti Hansen</PERSON>, the future Mrs. <PERSON>Keith Richards</PERSON>; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>; and the song "Amigo", from <PERSON>Roberto Carlos</PERSON>. Although I do not like him, <PERSON>Roberto Carlos</PERSON> has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as "The King". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "Muito Riso e <ORGANIZATION>Muita Alegria</ORGANIZATION>" ("Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness")
227 1 I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /><br />When asked about my favorite films, this is the one that I seem to always mention first. There are certain films (works of art like this film, "Dark City", and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend... This film "shook" me when I first saw it. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
228 0 Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, and by the end of the film, so are we all! <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> could not improve upon what <PERSON>Bogdonovich</PERSON> has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.
229 1 As much as the movie was good, i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already. all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> but from <LOCATION>Denemark</LOCATION>. Maybe I wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me.
230 0 Never cast models and <ORGANIZATION>Playboy</ORGANIZATION> bunnies in your films! <PERSON>Bob Fosse</PERSON>'s "Star 80" about <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, of whom <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than <PERSON>Dorothy</PERSON> herself on the silver screen. <PERSON>Patty Hansen</PERSON> is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la <LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION> but instead got <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> cavorting in jeans and a god-awful "poodlesque" hair-do....Very disappointing...."Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. <PERSON>Stratten</PERSON>'s tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
231 1 Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in <PERSON>Kafka</PERSON> style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br /><PERSON>Leopold Kessle</PERSON> is another <PERSON>Joseph K. Images</PERSON> of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love- a convention. The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.
232 0 I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. <PERSON>Dorothy S</PERSON> fans should stick to <LOCATION>Galaxina</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Peter B</PERSON> fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to <PERSON>Peter B</PERSON>'s amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.
233 1 Man oh man... I've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there's a long list!) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so. And "news" are: Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!<br /><br />For any <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON>'s "follower": both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc... Europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms. Everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! You really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmarish time warp. Taking from the masters of surreal cinema like <PERSON>Bunuel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>, till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> leads the art-film scene as the "well intended totalitarian" movie maker of nowadays. His authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world.<br /><br />As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. The day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it could be the start of a new era: "The age of emotional control over our fears". This is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.<br /><br />Bravo!
234 0 It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ben Gazarra</PERSON> and <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, <PERSON>Patty Henson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON> were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big <PERSON>Peter Bogdanovich</PERSON> fan and I enjoyed his last movie, "Cat's Meow" and all his early ones from "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>'s ex-girlfriend, <PERSON>Cybil Shepherd</PERSON> had a hit television series called "Moonlighting" stealing the story idea from <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no "Paper Moon" and only a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
235 1 <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON>'s Europa is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American coming to post-World War II <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Leopold Kessler</PERSON>, a German-American who refused to join the <ORGANIZATION>US Army</ORGANIZATION> during the war, arrives in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the <LOCATION>Zentropa Railway</LOCATION>. What he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the Werewolves who target American allies. <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> is strongly against taking any sides, but is drawn in and seduced by <PERSON>Katharina Hartmann</PERSON> (<PERSON>Barbara Sukowa</PERSON>), the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but is pardoned by the American Colonel <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> (<PERSON>Eddie Considine</PERSON>) because he can help get the German transportation system up and running again. The colonel soon enlists, or forces, <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains.<br /><br />Soon, <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems. Its amazing to watch the naive <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control. The film is endlessly unpredictable.<br /><br />The film stylishly shot, it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow. Its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout. Also, background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front. Add <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>'s hypnotic narration, and Europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.<br /><br />This is now a personal favorite film of mine.
236 0 This is said to be a personal film for <PERSON>Peter Bogdonavitch</PERSON>. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, who was murdered right after filming. But <PERSON>Patti Hanson</PERSON>, who would, in real life, marry <PERSON>Keith Richards</PERSON>, was also a model, like <PERSON>Stratten</PERSON>, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, <PERSON>Stratten</PERSON>'s part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.
237 1 Released as <LOCATION>Zentropa</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> to avoid confusion with <PERSON>Agniezska Holland</PERSON>'s own Holocaust film <LOCATION>Europa Europa</LOCATION>, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s horrors and enigmas.<br /><br />This progression starts when <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor <PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON>, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by <PERSON>Barbara Sukowa</PERSON>, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Uncle <PERSON>Kessler</PERSON> postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also <PERSON>Udo Kier</PERSON>, the tremendous actor who blew me away in <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON>'s shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.<br /><br />Another guest at the house is <PERSON>Eddie Constantine</PERSON>, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that <PERSON>Uncle Kessler</PERSON> was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.<br /><br />The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, <PERSON>Lars Von Trier</PERSON>, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey.<br /><br />This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie, and the Nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.<br /><br />The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, <PERSON>Barr</PERSON> on one and <PERSON>Sukowa</PERSON> on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>'s voice allures us to hark back to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with him, and abandon our personal restraint.
238 0 Who are these "They"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shootÂ— TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch.<br /><br /><PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>; the scenes with the breezy Ms. <PERSON>Stratten</PERSON> are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON> sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of <LOCATION>Vogue</LOCATION>.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON> thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what <PERSON>Gershwin</PERSON> (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. "They All Laughed" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all <PERSON>Peter Bogdanovich</PERSON> - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. <PERSON>Stratten</PERSON>'s scenes. But "Laughed" is a faint echo of "The Last Picture Show", "Paper Moon" or "What's Up, Doc"- following "Daisy Miller" and "At Long Last Love", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which <ORGANIZATION>P.B.</ORGANIZATION> has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time, I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick to <PERSON>Ernest Lubitsch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jaques Demy</PERSON>...
239 1 The best way for me to describe <ORGANIZATION>Europa</ORGANIZATION>, which is high on the list of my favourite films, is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended: "I didn't know films could be made like that". Entirely original in it's visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It's as far away from the "master and coverage" style of shooting as one can get; perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc... all equal, none predominant. Despite <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s "dialogue" myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, nor is it about beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the BLENDING of those elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the film has no meaning. "Europa" is what cinema should strive to be.
240 0 When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>. <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON>'s portrayal of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> is absolutely awful. <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>, the producers decided to get <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON>. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed <PERSON>York</PERSON>'s portrayal of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> in episodes of I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, <PERSON>Danny Pino</PERSON> playing <PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON> is horrible. <PERSON>Pino</PERSON> does not qualify to play as <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON>. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ethel</PERSON> were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON>.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>, I suggest watching A&E Biography of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>, read the book from <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> herself, or <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION>' American Masters: Finding <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the Laughter" would be a better choice. The casting of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON> in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
241 1 It is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day. While this really can't be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. That indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again. This is a challenging, provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. The problem with the movie is in its structure. Its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up, just as a second ending is tacked on. Though everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long by that unit. The long-delayed climax of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>'s awakening comes about 20 minutes late.<br /><br />Great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. The compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; A character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't. The world depicted is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for a memorable, technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop.<br /><br />The compositions are stunning. Whomever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it. Where is the DVD?<br /><br />It is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review. You should see it at least once. You get the sense that von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> bit off more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>'s Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. All von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies. After <PERSON>Zentropa</PERSON>, von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
242 0 Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in <LOCATION>Celoron</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Jamestown</LOCATION> to her later years with <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were <PERSON>Lucie Arnaz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desi, Jr.</PERSON>, I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.
243 1 Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON> shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.<br /><br />I could talk about the effects more but I think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own, and really heighten the drama of the film. A film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not.<br /><br />10/10 Don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.
244 0 I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />
245 1 I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film. Story lines fail, and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste. But, then I saw <PERSON>Zentropa</PERSON> (Europa) and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (<PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON>) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945. We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death. Unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing (for example) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email. Enjoy it!
246 0 Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old <PERSON>Peggy Lee</PERSON> song..<br /><br />"Is that all there is??" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, the "I Am Blank, Blank" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that "naughty sex film" that "revolutionized the film industry"...<br /><br />Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the "dirty" parts, just to get it over with.<br /><br />
247 1 That was the first thing that sprang to mind as I watched the closing credits to Europa make there was across the screen, never in my entire life have I seen a film of such technical genius, the visuals of Europa are so impressive that any film I watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison, forget your <PERSON>Michael Bay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON> slick <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> cinematography, <ORGANIZATION>Europa</ORGANIZATION> has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years. Now I'd be the first to hail <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON> a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, but this is stupid, the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema, whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) Europa has been hidden away, absent form video stores and (until recently) any British TV channels. <br /><br />The visuals in Europa are not MTV gloss; it's not a case of style over substance, its more a case of substance dictating style. Much like his first film The Element of Crime, von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa, we the audience) being hypnotized. As we move down the tracks, the voice of the Narrator (<PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in Europa. This allows <PERSON>von Trier</PERSON> and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery, there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background, who is in black and white, will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour, von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot, for instance, it's no surprise that the first shot of <PERSON>Leopold Kessler</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jean-marc Barr</PERSON>) is in colour, since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film. <br /><br />The performances are good, they may not be on par with performances in later von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> films, but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round. But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of <PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON> in the lead role, whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides, until he erupts in the films final act. Again, muck like The Element of Crime, the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state, left in this terrible place, with only the continuing narration of <PERSON>von Sydow</PERSON> to seal his fate. Europa is a tremendous film, and I cant help thinking what a shame that von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> has abandoned this way of filming, since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time, Europa, much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes. His dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled, not to mention his use of sound and production design. But since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue, but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10
248 0 This film was probably inspired by <PERSON>Godard</PERSON>'s Masculin, fÃ©minin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. <PERSON>Lena Nyman</PERSON> has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to <PERSON>Godard</PERSON>'s film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.
249 1 *Contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk!*<br /><br />I loved this film. The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. For instance, in one scene, <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back and <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>'s is in the foreground.<br /><br />One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups. It reminded me of <LOCATION>Battleship Potemkin</LOCATION>, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. Same with the scene when <PERSON>Katharina</PERSON> finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. It is one of the things I love about <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON>, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy.<br /><br />The use of text in the film was unique, like when <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>'s character is pushed by the word, "Werewolf." I have never seen anything like that in a film.<br /><br />The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd is great as <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>'s uncle. It brings up the snickers I got from his role in the <LOCATION>Kingdom</LOCATION> (Riget.) This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of <LOCATION>Riget</LOCATION> in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Yet some people, like <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it.<br /><br />The voice over, done expertly well by <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>, is amusing too. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into <PERSON>Leo</PERSON>'s head, which at times is a scary place to be.<br /><br />The movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where <PERSON>Bjork</PERSON>'s character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction. Actually, at one time, <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> seemed anti-woman to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters don't fare well either! I found myself at the same place during the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions, but of course, they never do!
250 0 If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />
251 1 <PERSON>Lars Von Trier</PERSON> is never backward in trying out new techniques. Some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.<br /><br />He depicts postwar <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> as a nightmarish train journey. With so many cities lying in ruins, <PERSON>Leo Kessler</PERSON> a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration. It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.<br /><br />His uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the Zentropa Railway Line. His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished. There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.<br /><br />The railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. In one sequence <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION> . These images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.<br /><br />At a station called <PERSON>Urmitz Leo</PERSON> jumps from the train with a parceled bomb. In view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage. He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. Later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank. Looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. Subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock. If you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous in fact. It could only happen in a dream.<br /><br />It's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer <PERSON>Lars Von Trier</PERSON>'s later films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above really put me off. Perhaps I'm a realist.
252 0 "I Am Curious: Yellow" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of <PERSON>Vincent Gallo</PERSON>'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on <PERSON>Chloe Sevigny</PERSON>. Before crying (or implying) "double-standard" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.
253 1 Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen in years. If you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir, then this is just the right cure for all of those <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days. <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON>'s follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gotten more acclaim, but this is really his best work. It is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor. It's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future. It's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here, but it's everyone's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead.
254 0 I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered "controversial" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, arguably their answer to good old boy <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON>, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.
255 1 <ORGANIZATION>Zentropa</ORGANIZATION> has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Like TTM, there is much inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand, and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives.<br /><br />But I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. <br /><br />This movie is unrelentingly grim--"noir" in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. Grim, but intriguing, and frightening.
256 0 This film, once sensational for its forward-thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given how socialistic <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> eventually became, the 'radicalism' of its politics, once controversial, appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials, look pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60's youth rebellion. One part of the film that still holds up: its self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall'. Every once in a while, the filmmakers film themselves making the film. The satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle.
257 1 <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world. So as viewers we think we watch a "true" story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie works disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots/ Idioterne). Of course the Dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON>).<br /><br />The story is typical for <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON>: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relations with everybody else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves. The idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist. <LOCATION>Mankind</LOCATION> is spoiled and purity only leads to (self-)destruction. (These elements were also very omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The movie is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in post-war <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.<br /><br />As a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed: shifting and fading washed-out colors, screen overlays, action on different overlays (with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). In this movie we can see how good Von Trier's handles film as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to step down from this (as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available).
258 0 I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two don't really mesh together. The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> and made a separate movie for the politics. There is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies, Dr. <PERSON>King</PERSON>, serious political interviews, flopping breasts, and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Other than the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored dry watching this film. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is. I think the cast did a fine job however. They played their parts believably. There is little of the over-the-topness I'm so used to seeing in the American films during this time.
259 1 With stunning cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity, this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene. The movie plays much like a dream, and I think that may be why people either hate it or love it. Characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless. But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices. The film works isn't trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies. <br /><br />I would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie, but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can completely understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.
260 0 Well, where to begin? I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON>'s book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this "documentary" is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a "Modern Cannibal Tale." I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly didn't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. I certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON> and all of his off-putting glory.<br /><br /><PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON> is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON>'s dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and say that he had "a small piece." That's it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON> is a cannibal by three inches. It's like calling a movie "The Life Of A True Don Juan" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played "just the tip." Unbelievable.<br /><br />The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I didn't read <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON>'s volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. One minute <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON> is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. I mean, <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON>, can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>? Also: I don't particularly care much for <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON>'s insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle I don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd.<br /><br />Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.<br /><br />The bottom line, here, is that <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON> is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I haven't read the book, but I'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON>'s work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON> is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un-riveting. If you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because "Keep The River To Your Right" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.
261 1 On October of 1945, the American German descendant <PERSON>Leopold Kessler</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON>) arrives in a post-war <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and his bitter Uncle <PERSON>Kessler</PERSON> (Ernst-Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd) gets a job for him in the Zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor. While traveling in the train learning his profession, he sees the destructed occupied <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and meets <PERSON>Katharina Hartmann</PERSON> (<PERSON>Barbara Sukowa</PERSON>), the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of <PERSON>Zentropa</PERSON>, <PERSON>Max Hartmann</PERSON> (JÃ¸rgen Reenberg). <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> stays neutral between the allied forces and the Germans, and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces. He falls in love for <PERSON>Katharina</PERSON>, and sooner she discloses that she was a "Werewolf". When <PERSON>Max</PERSON> commits suicide, <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> is also pressed by the "Werewolves" and need to take a position and a decision.<br /><br />"Europa" is an impressive and anguishing Kafkanian story of the great Danish director <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON>. Using an expressionist style that recalls <PERSON>Fritz Lang</PERSON> and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details, this movie discloses a difficult period of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. Very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify <PERSON>Max</PERSON>. <PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON> has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody. The hypnotic narration of <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> is another touch of class in this awarded film. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "Europa"
262 0 So, where are the cannibals? Those intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal' appeal of this film will be let down. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his re-visiting of a <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION> village full of natives, one of whom was his lover several decades prior. The man, <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON> is <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jewish as they come and somehow, this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes.<br /><br />There are no real cannibals here: only stories relayed by some of the natives and by <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> himself. Not all together a bad film. Very interesting and great cinematography. <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON> remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from Western Civilization as one can get.<br /><br />It's just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary.<br /><br />4 out of 10, kids.
263 1 This is the fifth von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them, The Element of Crime, Europa, Breaking the Waves, and Dancer in the Dark, I have given a 10, and one, The Idiots, I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it, although I'd like to see it once more before I do). He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. I tend to agree with him. I cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. In 50 years, when von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> or <PERSON>Fellini</PERSON> of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this.<br /><br />About Europa itself, I'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong. I think that's the point. This film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare, or the subconscious at some level. This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>'s narration. We are hypnotized, or von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> is hypnotized, and this is our/his subconscious mind. I'm inclined to lean more towards his mind, since the degradation of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> concerns me, an American, very little. This framing is also clear if you have seen The Element of Crime, an even more brilliant film than this (although I am disputing that in my mind; what Europa needs more than anything is a proper release on DVD, hopefully Criterion again, with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then, I am fairly sure, this film would seem as great as any of von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON>'s other films). In The Element of Crime, the film begins with a hypnotist, whom we actually see on screen this time, is hypnotizing <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>, a European detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish. The first words of that film are "Fantasy is okay, but my job is to keep you on track." And whenever <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>, the narrator, gets off track, the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story. He even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line. Something along the lines of, "Do you understand the difference between good and evil?" The hypnotist laughs and says, "Now, <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>, she didn't really say that, did she?"<br /><br />So the key to interpreting Europa, almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime, is that we are deep in our/von Trier's subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. What does the train itself symbolize? Consider it internally, and only then discuss it externally. Europa is a great film, a masterpiece. I was never bored by it, even though I watched it at 3 am. The perfect time to watch, actually, since it works in dream logic.
264 0 "In 1955, <PERSON>Tobias Schneerbaum</PERSON> disappeared in the <LOCATION>Peruvian Amazon</LOCATION>. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back." Supposedly, "Keep the River On your Right" is "a modern cannibal tale". In reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of <LOCATION>New Ginuea</LOCATION>, mostly touting the native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but really that's about it. Unless of course, you are interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal tale." - <PERSON>MERK</PERSON>
265 1 Storyline: <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>'s voice-over narration hypnotizes the protagonist (and audience) back to 1945 where our protagonist the young American ideologist <PERSON>Leopold Kessler</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON>) has just arrived in post-WWII 1945 <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to help rebuilding the damaged country. Uncle <PERSON>Kessler</PERSON> (Ernst-Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd) supplies <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> with a job in the big Zentropa train corporation, but soon <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> falls in love with <PERSON>Katharina Hartmann</PERSON> (<PERSON>Barbara Sukowa</PERSON>); daughter of Zentropa owner <PERSON>Max Hartmann</PERSON> (JÃ¸rgen Reenberg). <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption, being taken advantage of, losing his ideology, and is forced to chose between pest or colera.<br /><br />Mysterious, mesmerizing, manipulative, noirish, haunting, beautiful, and ugly. These are some immediate, grandiose, descriptions that come to mind when thinking of <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON>'s 1991 masterpiece EUROPA; the final chapter of the Europa trilogy. In <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn't confuse it with <PERSON>Agnieszka Holland</PERSON>'s EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 (equally a WWII drama). The Europa trilogy also consists of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984 and EPIDEMIC from 1987 (the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the Danish cinemas). The trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism, although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals. In the opening-shot of EUROPA we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us: "On the mental count of ten, you will be in Europa. Be there at ten. I say: ten". A metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dream-reality.<br /><br />EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style -- that famous Russian director <PERSON>Andrei Tarkovsky</PERSON> is <PERSON>Trier</PERSON>'s main-influence says it all. It's a black-and-white movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood, a red dress etc. According to rumors this inspired <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> to use the similar effect in SHINDLER'S LIST from 1993 (coincidentially another WWII drama). Furthermore <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> uses so-called Dutch angels and reinvents background-projection by adding separately shot co-operating layers upon layers, but unlike old <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> movies that incorporated it for economical reasons, <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> uses it for artistic reasons. These carefully executed strange-looking visual techniques underline that we are in a dream-reality, we are hypnotized; the universe of EUROPA is not real! EUROPA is often criticized for weighing advanced technique (such as multi-layered background-projection) above plot and characters, but hey that's what reviewers criticized <PERSON>Stanley Kubrick</PERSON>'s 1968 visual masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for -- nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema-history books.<br /><br />EUROPA also gets accused of historical incorrectness. Apparently <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> assigns the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>' Werewolf terrorist-group too much historical significance. According to various online-sources that's correct (a fascinating subject - try Googl'ing it yourself!), yet Trier's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately. EUROPA is a never-ending nightmare. <PERSON>Leopold Kessler</PERSON> is hypnotized, therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality. Equally it shows how our memory deceives us -- a 100% accurate reconstruction is a lie! Although young audiences who experience EUROPA are too young to have memories from WWII, we have a collective memory of it from various <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> documentaries, so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose: they inform us us that we are not in post-WWII Germany 1945, but in <LOCATION>Leopolds</LOCATION> memory of it.<br /><br />All three Europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence. The ambiguous endings of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT and EUROPA show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities. Before, during and after shooting EUROPA in 1990 in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON> and co-writer Niels VÃ¸rsel were extremely interested in WWII. It shows. It's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the time-period spot-on. A great example is the old Polish church (EUROPA was shot in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> primarily for economic reasons) in the last act of EUROPA. As with 2001: SPACE ODYSSEY I think EUROPA will receive it's rightfully deserved place in cinema-history. Its method of twisting old film-noir love-affair clichÃ©s and visual techniques is so unique, strange and completely different from anything you will see from <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> nowadays, or any other dream-factory for that matter.<br /><br />EUROPA is an essential movie in the Lars von Trier catalog. Some write it off as pure commercial speculation, but that would be catastrophic. It's right up there with other Trier classics and semi-classics such as FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984, the TV-series RIGET from 1993 and DOGVILLE from 2003. It's a unique experience from before <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> cared for his actors, and before the Dogme95 Manifesto. Watch it! "On the count of ten..." 9/10
266 0 Well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview, else I would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. I mean haven't we had enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them self serious! The plot sucks, and the acting is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst I've seen in the cinema with this one.)<br /><br />There is so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that you don't even now who has been killed, and who has not. (and you don't care.) The only of them I knew in advance was <PERSON>Denise</PERSON>, and she was the most talent less actress I have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie.<br /><br />Stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
267 1 A few years ago, a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the <PERSON>Michael Mann</PERSON> film 'Heat' on it. After we finished that movie, and were about to stand up, we saw that there is another film just after, tough on the cassette's envelope the owner didn't write it up. Yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits.<br /><br />Some two hours later, I just sat there wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before?...<br /><br />This film was Europa. <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON> woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts!<br /><br />The story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped. But he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. He hires with Zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> collaborators the Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When he doesn't understand the world (or just Europeans) anymore, in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved.<br /><br />As a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the Werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit assassinated the major of Allied-occupied <LOCATION>Aachen</LOCATION>, two months before the capitulation, the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the Werewolf. But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training, and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in Bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s death and the war's end it all fell apart.<br /><br />However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas main exploded in the police HQ of bombed-out <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION>, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>. The effect was strongest on the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) 'preemptively' on suspicion of being Werewolf, and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died.
268 0 This movie in away was super-clever. It's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> makes ZERO attempt to be original. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /><br />I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off. 1.Prom Night 2.<PERSON>Carrie</PERSON> 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.<br /><br />I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.<br /><br /><PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> had no chance of being a good movie. How come every horror movie has to have a "suprise" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute a nice girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.<br /><br />Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> doesn't have this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /><br />Do not see this overly-inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself, and you want to die.<br /><br />*1/2 (3) -<ORGANIZATION>J.Leonard Rollins</ORGANIZATION>-
269 1 Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part, and how <PERSON>Lars Von Trier</PERSON> tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, "Zentropa" (or "Europa" as it is referred to outside the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post WWII Europe, namely the decimated German landscape, whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people. <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> brilliantly paints his vision on screen. You will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes, while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge, especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. <br /><br />For some reason, <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> got caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this. And while his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classics in their own right, it is with "Zentropa" that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like a fine wine, and begs for a DVD release.
270 0 here was no effort put into Valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film, a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so. I've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies, including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to <PERSON>Carrie</PERSON>, and as much as I hate to be redundant, the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor <PERSON>Jeremy</PERSON>'s head early in the film is so obviously taken from <PERSON>Carrie</PERSON> that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`Hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my Carrie-rip-off scene. Enjoy!'). But that's just a suggestion.<br /><br />(spoilers) The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone, and then THEY start to get killed. The problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. Take <PERSON>Jason</PERSON>, for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor <PERSON>Jeremy</PERSON> was treated, he is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that, and more importantly, he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentine's Day cards. <br /><br />It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure, I thought for a while that he might very well be the killer, but that's not the point. We know from early on that he is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, he appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know he is a cardboard character, but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him.<br /><br />On the positive side, the killer's true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another rip-off. Early in the film, when <PERSON>Shelley</PERSON> stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel, he makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director <PERSON>Jamie Blanks</PERSON> (who, with all due respect, looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is, of course, completely unnecessary, because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and <PERSON>Michael Meyer</PERSON>'s is that <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>'s mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. <br /><br />At the end, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal), but then we see <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>'s nose start to bleed as he holds <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, his often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that he's been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. Valentine is not scary (I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember, and even I wasn't scared), and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die. I remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than <LOCATION>Battlefield Earth</LOCATION>), but the end result is the same old thing.
271 1 It was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series, from one to seven. And this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain. Plus it showed some of the puppet master series that I didn't see and I what to see it so badly like part two. It showed an appearance of Torch which can turn things and humans, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet master from part one. It also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool, it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did.So thanks to this Puppet Master is going to be a big hit.
272 0 ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality? It awfully seems so. First of all, this is a noble premise that could've been utilized well. A rejected young nerd who grows up, stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high? Can't say you had nothing to work with. But this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers. Everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike. We know the pattern by now. These stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute. Let me ask you something: Who, in their right mind, is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any damn sense at all?<br /><br />"Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. One good shot involves the butchering of <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>' character. She gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw. There's some good songs in the soundtrack, including one cool track by Orgy. The music video is contained in the special features section on the DVD.<br /><br />Even the acting is mediocre at best. The actors all sleep through their roles. Of course, <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON> is often stoic, even in his portrayal as the title character on "Angel." <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> is a fine actress, though, and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie.<br /><br />"Valentine" is just like you'd expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, cheesy and without a good scare in sight. Don't even bother.<br /><br />My score: 4 (out of 10)
273 1 This movie is a great way for the series to finally end. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> (the boy from Puppet Master III) is all grown up and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn <LOCATION>Toulon</LOCATION>'s secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. Most of this movie is footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master, and Retro Puppet Master (sorry... But I guess <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't let them use scenes from 1). Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say "This is THE final movie in the series..."
274 0 Its plain to see why the makers of Scary Movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher' movies. They are so unbelievably formulaic. And if <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> had been released a year or so earlier, I'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the Screams, I know what you did last summers, and Urban Legends.<br /><br />Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in typically over the top style. Lots of T&A on display, no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate bloodshed.<br /><br />The thing I can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its?'. The thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered. Usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway (eg. main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog). Everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect', but they are more '<ORGANIZATION>Red Herrings</ORGANIZATION>' than suspects. As we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed.<br /><br />Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************SPOILER!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway)*************** In Valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way. The issue is only part resolved, and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody. Will the killer want more, or were the demons truly vanquished?<br /><br />This still didn't make Valentine a good film, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still doesn't count for much. To anybody thinking of making another film along these lines, please don't. Originality is so important, and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre.
275 1 After some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had Â£3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & I'm glad i did, i enjoyed it. Directed by The star of films such as Chain Reaction, the Ring, <ORGANIZATION>Bourne Identity</ORGANIZATION>,(<PERSON>Brian Cox</PERSON>) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't at all, i found some of the humour quite funny especially <PERSON>Alfred Molina</PERSON> the star of Spider-man 2 the Character <PERSON>Doc Ock</PERSON>. He was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film. Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON>'s name, and that made me get it! and no his part isn't big at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film. I suggest you give it a go. Some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing, the acting, and a bit more action. But it's watchable.
276 0 The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually scared me. The acting wasn't too bad, and the "Cupid" killer was believable and disturbing.<br /><br />The Bad: The story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There just wasn't much to it. The ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.<br /><br />Overall: A good scare, but a bad story.<br /><br />** out of *****
277 1 I don't understand why the other comments focus on <PERSON>McConaughey</PERSON>. He has never been a very interesting film actor. <br /><br />The best part of this movie is the writing and the wit. <PERSON>Alfred Molina</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patrick McGaw</PERSON> make an unusual comic duo, definitely not stock types. Although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny.<br /><br />The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialog, so that was certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /><br />A very underrated movie, judging by the unusually low score IMDb members have given it. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting.
278 0 This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is normally good. I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. Although it<br /><br />was a horror movie. Which i don't prefer. But no horror came to mind while watching the movie. It was a dull,<br /><br />not very entertaining movie. The appearance of <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON><br /><br />was again a pleasure for the eye. But that's it. We (the four of us)<br /><br />we're a little bit disappointed. But feel free to see this movie and<br /><br />judge it yourself.
279 1 First of all, <PERSON>Riget</PERSON> is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Nice combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story together with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there's no 'the end'. As for me it's unacceptable. I was thinking... how it will be possible to continue the story without <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Drusse</PERSON>? ...and I have some idea. I think <PERSON>Lars</PERSON> should make RIGET III a little bit different. I'm sure that 3rd part without <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON> wouldn't be the same. So here's my suggestion. Mayble little bit stupid, maybe not. I know that <PERSON>Lars</PERSON> likes to experiment. So why not to make small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (like for example "team <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>" by <PERSON>Trey Parker</PERSON>) or even computer 3d animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle I believe it could work... only this way it's possible to make actors alive again. For <PERSON>Riget</PERSON> fans this shouldn't be so big difference - if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie. The most important thing now is the story. It's completely understandable that it's not possible to create <ORGANIZATION>Riget</ORGANIZATION> 3 with the actors nowadays. So why not to play with animation? And... look for the possibilities that it gives to you! Even marketing one! Great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Just dreams?<br /><br />I hope to see Riget 3 someday... or even to see just the script. I'm curious how the story ends... and as I expect- everybody here do.<br /><br />greets, slaj<br /><br />ps: I'm not talking about the "kingdom hospital" by <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> ;-)
280 0 Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought of it:<br /><br />Acting: Very bad. <PERSON>Katherine Heigl</PERSON> can not act. The other's weren't much better.<br /><br />Story: The story was okay, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed.<br /><br />Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool.<br /><br />Originality: Not very original. The name `<PERSON>Paige Prescott</PERSON>' Recognize <PERSON>Prescott</PERSON>?<br /><br />Bottom Line: Don't see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie.<br /><br />1/10<br /><br />
281 1 Normally I don't like series at all. They're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast.<br /><br />These series however, are well played, the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be catching your mind.<br /><br />The episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital.
282 0 This stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre. A masked killer stalks young, pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways, none of which are particularly inventive.<br /><br />It's not scary, it's not clever, and it's not funny. So what was the point of it?
283 1 More eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of <PERSON>Lars Von Trier</PERSON>'s fantastic horror satire The <LOCATION>Kingdom</LOCATION>... Much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more. Plus a great performance from <PERSON>Udo Kier</PERSON> in a more substantial role...
284 0 Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.
285 1 Second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit Danish tv-series is slightly inferior to the first one, but has plenty of laughs and scares as well. This time, <PERSON>Udo Kier</PERSON> plays two parts, as the monster baby and his demon-like father. Other standout parts this time are SÃ¸ren PilmarkÂ´s Doctor <PERSON>Krogshoj</PERSON>, who must face the horrible revenge of Dr. <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON>, and once again, patient Mrs. <PERSON>Drusse</PERSON> tries to solve the mysteries, Miss Marple-style. Ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors Ernst Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd (Dr. <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Kirsten Rolffes</PERSON> (Mrs. <PERSON>Drusse</PERSON>), you wonder how theyÂ´re ever going to be able making Part III, but I hope <PERSON>Von Trier</PERSON> will give it a shot. Sadly, <PERSON>Morten Rotne Leffers</PERSON>, the DownÂ´s Syndrome dishwasher #2, died shortly after, as well. Look for Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd in a cameo. ***
286 0 In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that's ever been done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it's not funny. And the moment the killer comes on screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD Get over it!<br /><br />0 out of 10
287 1 Riget II is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one. This series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one. There are much more comedy in this, good one, though.<br /><br />We're back at the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. <PERSON>Drusse</PERSON> is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done, but fate want's it otherwise. She is soon chasing ghosts and <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON> is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the <LOCATION>Kingdom</LOCATION>.<br /><br />This story involves a lot more comedy that the previous. By all means lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. The story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just kind of silly, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and thrilling as the first series.<br /><br />The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's an odd story and setting. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job. Yet, these actors handle this whole situation perfectly.<br /><br />Much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact. The cinematography is one of those qualities. The hand-held camera that made Trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and <PERSON>Trier</PERSON> makes use of these abilities. Good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first. Also be prepared to see some more. I didn't think that green thing looked all too good. Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit. Never the less, the effects like the ghosts are really good. The non-digital effects looks good too. Little Brother looks just really odd, but you accept it. All over I'd say effects are from OK to good.<br /><br />The music is also quite good. <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION> and nice. Some of it are really touching. It fits really nice. As the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well.<br /><br />All together this makes a good sequel. If you'd seen Riget you can see this one without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two makes up a series you don't wanna miss.
288 0 There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad this movie is. It's a shame that I actually sat through this movie, this very tiresome and predictable movie. What's wrong with it? Acting: There is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub-par (atleast they are all very pretty). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get Orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days. Don't even get me started on the "What the hell?" moments, here are a few: Killer can move at the speed of light--door opens actress turns, no one is there, turns back, there is something sitting in front of her.; Out of now where The killer shows up with a power drill, a really big one! The filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of Holy Grail and want to say "Where'd you get the power drill?". I could go on and on about how bad this film is but I only have 1000 words. I will give this 2 out of ten stars. One star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage. Seriously, do not waste your time with this one.
289 1 Wow... 5 more hours of Riget. <PERSON>Lars</PERSON> continues the great combination of occult, dark horror and soap-opera drama. Picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off(complete with the same high intensity and suspense, though that doesn't last; for better or worse), this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste... in the last series, there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode, whereas in this, it clearly is one long stretch... where one episode ends, the next begins. A lot can be said about <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON>... but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric. Both qualities show in this. The plot continues its excellence, now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention. Basically every character from the first returns, at least as far as the main roles go. The pacing isn't as sharp as in the first part, and I found myself less gripped by this one. That is not in any kind of way to say that this didn't involve me, though... I still found myself constantly watching, and at several points reacting strongly, often out loud, to what was going on(extremely unusual behavior for me, as I am an incredibly silent person), as I also was during the first. Like the first, this also brings up some loaded ethical questions. Building on the foundation from the first, this brings the story further... and being a sequel, the scope is also bigger. Grander. More spirits, more bizarre occurrences, more subplots. The strong graphic material of the first also returns, and it's been kicked up a notch. The characters are developed further. The acting is amazing, as that of the first. <PERSON>Udo Kier</PERSON> solidifies his immense talent, to anyone who doubted it. Playing a very difficult character(anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what I mean) *and* acting in a language he didn't speak(he was later dubbed)... and still handing in such a strong performance. The cinematography remains great, and is still very hand-held, with rapid zooms and the occasional long take. The editing is sharp, with a few direct cuts in sound(though these were more prominent in the first). Now, with all that said, I would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10... or at least just under, like the first four episodes. I truly enjoyed watching, and I don't regret it in the least. But this does have shortcomings... the ones the first part had and more. As the first, the humor just takes up too much space... and this time around, it's even worse. There are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief... three of them, no less. Scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh. Fine for a comedy, but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant, yes, nothing short of sadistic at times, horror piece? <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON>'s solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof... from which he could see his beloved <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>... to a bathroom. With an angle from inside the bowl. No, you read that right. In general, the humor seems more low-brow... more sex and bodily function jokes, which, again, begs the question "Why?". Whilst most of the writing is excellent, some of it is downright dire. Several scenes are basically copied from the first mini-series(one would guess due to their popularity when it aired). At times, the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first, and it jumps too much at times. Fortunately seldom, but still noticeably, plot points and items are explained away too easily(a certain character living in <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> for no apparent reason, for example... anyone who's seen it knows who I'm speaking of). The two dishwashers, while still mysterious and insightful, become too much of a gimmick... too overexposed, in the end, I guess. Most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable, though. In addition to that, I want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things I have just written that this is still mostly good... definitely enjoyable, compelling, powerful... and in my humble opinion, it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first(though if belong in that group; do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first). I recommend this to any fan of <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON> and anyone who enjoyed the first <LOCATION>Riget</LOCATION> and wants more where that came from. I urge anyone who's even considering watching this to make sure you've seen all of the first before you do... I bought this before I bought the first, but I held out on watching until I had bought the first and watched that, and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did. Though this features a brief summary of the events in the first, there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn't see it before watching this. Slightly lesser sequel, but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first. 8/10
290 0 There are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad Valentine that I don't know where to begin. I will say this though; here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the Valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school. You know, the ones with <PERSON>Batman</PERSON> exclaiming "You're a super crime-fighting valentine!"<br /><br />Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of Scream. The villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable. The heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming "HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!" The score is more overbearing than <PERSON>Norman Bates</PERSON>' mother.<br /><br />The flimsy plot follows several childhood friends, now grown up and extremely curvaceous. Since the film gives them nothing else to do, they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one. This stalker appears to be former nerd <PERSON>Jeremy Melton</PERSON>, who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. With Valentine's Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom. <PERSON>Melton</PERSON> seems like the obvious suspect. Only problem is, as numerous characters warns, in thirteen years <PERSON>Melton</PERSON> could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome. So (insert terrified gasp here) everyone is a suspect!<br /><br />Here's problem one. In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>. Nerds don't turn into Angel when they grown up, they turn into older, balder nerds. He's not a terrible actor, but the script, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out. <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> (the bustiest actress in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> never to star in <LOCATION>Baywatch</LOCATION>) is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene. Note to self: always bring a bathing suit to a Valentine's Day party. Just because it's February doesn't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip.<br /><br />The slasher in Valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a Cherub's mask. Here's problem number two. The filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons. Plain and simple, it's not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face, including his eyes and ears, can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables. Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands. <br /><br />Not only is the movie bad, it isn't even sure who the killer is; the final "twist" is more "Huh?" than "Hah!" When you're not scratching your head you're yawning, then groaning, then searching for the nearest exit. Do not watch this movie. Even if you're alone on Valentine's Day, find something, ANYTHING, else to do. You'll be glad you did.
291 1 Sequel to "The Kingdom" is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo...this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you.<br /><br />Also, you don't have to see Part 1 to understand this...you'll figure it out!<br /><br />Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring. <br /><br />Sadly, there probably won't be a "Kingdom 3"--Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this was filmed. But you never know!
292 0 There's one line that makes it worth to rent for Angel fans. Everyone else: this is just a very bad horror flick. The female characters are typical horror movies females. They are wooden, annoying and dumb. You are glad when they are killed off. Long live the strong female character in a horror movie!!
293 1 I reached the end of this and I was almost shouting "No, no, no, NO! It cannot end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The engagement of the dishwashers? <PERSON>Mona</PERSON>'s disappearance? <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON>'s comeuppance? The "zombie"? Was Little Brother saved by his father? And what about the head???????" ARGH!! Then I read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and I have to say, I know it probably wouldn't be true to <PERSON>Lars von Trier</PERSON>'s vision, but I would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned! Granted, it would be hard to find someone to play <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON> as the character deserves. <PERSON>Helmer</PERSON>, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have yet to see a more self-absorbed, oblivious, self-righteous character on screen! But, I could overlook a change in actors....I just have to know how it ends!
294 0 "Valentine" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "Scream", and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"). It certainly isn't as good as those movies that I have listed about, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "Friday the 13th" film. One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made "My Bloody Valentine", which I hated alot. "Valentine" is a better film than that one, but it's not saying much. The plot: a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up, then they're picked off one-by-one. The killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge. But is it him? Or could it be somebody else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast which includes <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jessica Capshaw</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Katherine Heigl</PERSON>. They do what they can with the material they've got, but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice. There are some scary moments throughout, however. <br /><br />** (out of four)
295 1 The stories in this video are very entertaining, and it definately is worth a look! The first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks, with a great, but unexplained twist at the end.<br /><br />The seond is the best of the lot, and it alone, makes this worth watching - A man is attacked by a dog, which he fears to be rabid - He finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be...... Great twist at the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10! If the others were up to par with this one, this would get 10/10!<br /><br />The third is the weakest of the bunch - A girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! There appears to be no point to the story until the end, with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the awful first part!<br /><br />Never the less, this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! Well worth a rental!
296 0 I'm in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies. We also have access to plenty of pirated movies, this gem came along with 11 other movies, and this is easily the worst I've seen in a long time. I've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but really, I think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible. It's not tongue in cheek, the writers really thought they were improving on the movie Blade. This movie is just one notch above Vampire Assassin, which if you haven't seen, i recommend. At least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible. This is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever. from the bad acting, to clichÃ© visual (ie opening credits), to the adobe premier special effects. they couldn't even get blanks for the guns, which may have to do with where the movie was filmed, but if you're going to use effects, make them close to accurate. as for the cast, it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out. Once again, like <PERSON>Ron Hall</PERSON> in Vampire Assassin, don't let stunt folk act, they can't. Also, the comment about this being a "return of old vampire movies"...no, it's not. This is exactly what all new vampire movies are about. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, they're all about some super star fighting the vampires. This is the newest vampire genre, with bad blood, fake screams, and cheesy over acting. obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie, or friends of the cast. But what do I care, I paid 33 cents for it. Anyway, to wrap this up, someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie, I give them credit because it's better than I could do. Of course I also know I can't make movies so I don't try. I do know how to watch movies though. I work 12 hour nights, 6 days a week, I've seen several thousand in the year I've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack.
297 1 Like his earlier film, "In a Glass Cage", <PERSON>AgustÃ­ Villaronga</PERSON> achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. The heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it. In that way, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye. Unabashed, gorgeous, and highly tense... this film is simply superb!
298 0 Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine that <PERSON>Stephanie Beaham</PERSON> had some bills to pay when taking on this role.<br /><br />The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.<br /><br /><PERSON>Bruce Lee</PERSON> led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing.<br /><br />Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year.
299 1 If you want to learn something about the Spanish Civil War and about all the political details and intrigues, let me tell you, you've chosen the wrong film.<br /><br />This is a vision of the war as it happened in <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION>, a small island off the coast of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. When a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once, there is no war in the open. The soldiers are sent to the front to fight, in the mainland, while another kind of war happens at home, on the small island. There, neighbours tell on other neighbours, sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime, but many people are told on because of old family fights, or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to "earn some points". And these things don't happen in the open. There were some trials, true, but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night, taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed. And the next morning the bodies would be found, and people would have an idea of what had happened, but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything. We're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life. We're talking about people killing their neighbours, and probably saying hello to their widow the next day, and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed. We're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants, where everybody knew everybody.<br /><br />I am from that small island and I've heard the stories my grandparents told me, and I must say that this film upset me, oh yes, it did; but I also found it remarkably beautiful and moving. The initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up, that's how things happened during that war. A kid knowing that his mate's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad? Completely possible. All that happened later on? Possible too. TB was real too. At that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become. People were poor, illiterate, and worked in small farms. After the war there were times of hardship.<br /><br />So, you won't find a war story in this film, or at least not the kind of war story you expect. There are no battlefields, no soldiers, no political intrigues. This is the meanest kind of war, which happens when the space is limited (just check the size of the island), when neighbours fight with their neighbours, when members of the same family fight each other, and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody. You'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage, or maybe they don't.<br /><br />I must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors, who managed to sound really Majorcan. That was remarkable.
300 0 Dude, really!!!! where have you guys been the past 20 years, this is shocking in all kind of ways, horror ? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, If you want to look at the classics, Freaks of <PERSON>Tod Browning</PERSON>, the victims of Dracula and <PERSON>Frankenstein</PERSON>, the Undying Monster, <PERSON>Ernest Thesiger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Wegener</PERSON>'s The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay etc. Total waist of money and free time, have watched a lot of movies, were as horror is my all time favorite, I really am speechless, have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft, please understand
301 1 The latest film by the Spanish director <PERSON>Agusti Villaronga</PERSON> is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community, develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty. Whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute, <PERSON>Villaronga</PERSON> creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> under <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>. The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis.<br /><br />The cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the Spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow Spaniard <PERSON>Pedro Almodovar</PERSON>'s work with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that <PERSON>Villaronga</PERSON> favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic, gritty realism opposed to <PERSON>Almodovar</PERSON>'s use of surrealism, although both styles are similar.<br /><br />The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing.
302 0 This is really terrible.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched, I would have a suitable reply.<br /><br />I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies.<br /><br />There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.<br /><br />I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable.
303 1 Film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless. Gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits. The story is sweeping. It takes the audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human wreckage left behind. <PERSON>Roger Casamajor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bruno Bertanzoni</PERSON> are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, scenery and cinematography are wonderful. I absolutely love the photography.
304 0 You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> didn't deserve to win any <PERSON>Oscar</PERSON> for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: "Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life." This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shug Avery</PERSON> do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON> they have found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss <PERSON>Millie</PERSON>'s car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; <PERSON>Harpo</PERSON> falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if <PERSON>Harpo</PERSON>'s name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife <PERSON>Sophia</PERSON>'s real name, "<PERSON>Oprah</PERSON>," backwards. <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> isn't above such "cuteness."<br /><br />It's not that <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion. <PERSON>Schindler</PERSON>'s List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.
305 1 I saw "El Mar" yesterday and thought it to be a great movie. It starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: <PERSON>Ramallo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Manuel Tur</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Francisca</PERSON>. After that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again.<br /><br />Religion, sickness, love, violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension-filled movie.<br /><br />I see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. To get hurt. To bleed. And i think that what the film shows, isn't done for pure shock-value or presented in a distasteful way. I know that some people like their films "clean", even those with violence in it. But sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work. This is one of those movies. And a great movie it is.<br /><br />The only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, it all made sense. But it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story, so i still give this movie a 9.
306 0 "<PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? Nobody should love that." - <PERSON>Lucius Shepard</PERSON><br /><br />"The Color Purple" takes place in the Deep South during the early 1900s, and tells the story of <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON>, two African American sisters. The film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. This motif Â– innocence interrupted by men Â– permeates the entire film.<br /><br />The film then launches into a series of short sequences. <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named <PERSON>Albert Johnson</PERSON>, a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, clean and look after his children.<br /><br />All these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work. The cumulative effect is like the merging of a <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused <PERSON>Stanley Kubrick</PERSON> to remark that "The Color Purple" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? He lasted a long time.<br /><br />The film is often said to deal which "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but this is not true. <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON>, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery, which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. For <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>, the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.<br /><br /><PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s film, however, re-frames <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s story through the lens of comforting American mythologies. This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. A film in which <PERSON>Albert</PERSON> finds himself in various ridiculous situations, moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool. A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins), stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /><br />This is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. A film in which black people are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (<PERSON>Albert</PERSON> lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept. This is not the <LOCATION>Old South</LOCATION>, this is the Old South as derived from "Gone With The Wind", <ORGANIZATION>MGM Muscals</ORGANIZATION>, "Song of the South", <ORGANIZATION>Warner Cartoons</ORGANIZATION>, "Halleluha!" and banned <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> movies. In other words, it's the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> as seen by a child raised on 50s TV. It's all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist <PERSON>Ishmael Reed</PERSON> famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.<br /><br />Of course, in typical <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed. This reconciliation was in <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s novel, but <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.<br /><br />Beyond <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s hate letter to black men and <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s bizarre caricaturing of black life, we are shown nothing of the black community. We have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community. Instead, <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention (one of <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>'s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a "Home Alone" movie), every emotion over played, the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by. Couple this with <PERSON>Quincy Jones</PERSON>' ridiculously "white" music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed by a white Jew in the style of <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON>, scored by a black man trying to emulate <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON>.<br /><br />Problematic too is the lack of white characters. Consider this: the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood. No, they are cruel by nature. And the women, whether quietly suffering like <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors, women unable to support themselves and their children alone.<br /><br />And so there's a hidden ideology at work here. Late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them. ie- Respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture. <br /><br />3/10 - A failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering "The Color Purple" worthless.
307 1 This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. Here we see what life has wrought on each of them. One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.<br /><br />This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.
308 0 Watched this on DVD in original language with English subs. Either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development. There are quite a few HK stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long. If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot. I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.
309 1 "El Mar" directed by Catalonian director <PERSON>Agusti Villarona</PERSON>, and based on the novel by <PERSON>Blai Bonet</PERSON>, offers a glimpse of the Spanish history as seen by a Balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country. The movie concentrates on three friends, and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION>, to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium, lost in the countryside.<br /><br />We first meet three boys that are playing happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed. The boys have excluded a young girl, about their age, from taking part in their games.<br /><br />When we meet the adult <PERSON>Ramallo</PERSON> again, he is on his way to a sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, <PERSON>Manuel Tur</PERSON>, one of his boyhood friends is also being treated, and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care. It is obvious that Tur looks at <PERSON>Ramallo</PERSON> in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences.<br /><br /><PERSON>Roger Casamajor</PERSON> does a good job with portraying the older <PERSON>Ramallo</PERSON>. <PERSON>Bruno Bergonzino</PERSON> makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable youth. <PERSON>Antonia Torrens</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Sor Francisca</PERSON> with conviction. <PERSON>Angela Molina</PERSON>, puts an appearance as <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON>, the wife of the caretaker of the institution. <PERSON>Simon Andreu</PERSON> is perfect as <PERSON>Alcantara</PERSON>.<br /><br />"El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows <PERSON>Agusti Villarona</PERSON>'s talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer.
310 0 This is not so much film as big budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'Insomnia'. When it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought "Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!" but no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long, white eyebrows. <ORGANIZATION>Zu Warriors</ORGANIZATION> makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. That's not a good sign. I found the special effects to be somewhere between <PERSON>Ray Harryhausen</PERSON> and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
311 1 <ORGANIZATION>EL MAR</ORGANIZATION> is a tough, stark, utterly brilliant, brave work of cinematic art. Director <PERSON>AgustÃ­ Villaronga</PERSON>, with an adaptation by <PERSON>Antoni Aloy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Biel Mesquida</PERSON> of <PERSON>Blai Bonet</PERSON>'s novel, has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives. And though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children, the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear. This film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering: the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward adulthood.<br /><br />A small group of children are shown in the Spanish Civil War of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens. <PERSON>Ramala</PERSON> (<PERSON>Nilo Mur</PERSON>), Tur (<PERSON>David Lozano</PERSON>), <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sergi Moreno</PERSON>), and <PERSON>Francisca</PERSON> (<PERSON>Victoria Verger</PERSON>) witness the terror of the assassination of men, and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide. These wide-eyed children become adults, carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds.<br /><br />We then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium. <PERSON>Ramala</PERSON> (<PERSON>Roger Casamajor</PERSON>) has survived as a male prostitute, protected by his 'john' <PERSON>Morell</PERSON> (<PERSON>Juli Mira</PERSON>), and has kept his life style private. Tur (<PERSON>Bruno Bergonzini</PERSON>) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to Catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion. <PERSON>Francisca</PERSON> (AntÃ²nia Torrens) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium. The three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war. Tur longs for <PERSON>Ramala</PERSON>'s love, <PERSON>Ramala</PERSON> longs to be free from his <PERSON>Morell</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Francisca</PERSON> must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun's habit.<br /><br />The setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death, between lust and love, and between devotion and destruction is played out. To detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer, but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved (in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable. For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director <PERSON>Villaronga</PERSON> is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense. The actors, both as children and as adults, are splendid: <PERSON>Roger Cassamoor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bruno Bergonzini</PERSON> and AntÃ²nia <PERSON>Torrens</PERSON> are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles. The cinematography by <PERSON>Jaime Peracaula</PERSON> and the haunting musical score by <PERSON>Javier Navarrete</PERSON> serve the director's vision. A tough film, this, but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath. In Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br /><PERSON>Grady Harp</PERSON>
312 0 <ORGANIZATION>Zu Warriors</ORGANIZATION> most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid.The movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something.Whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical God /Demon/Wizard thing.The plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie.The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying,princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed <PERSON>Uwe Boll</PERSON> like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something.Even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like (yes that's a word!).I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand....who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all.It felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time.I can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching Inu-Yasha at episode 134 drunk...yeah that's right you don't know what the hell is going on.Don't waste your brain trying to figure this out.
313 1 "Gespenster" Question of to be cool in the German cinema<br /><br />There are not many German films in the last ten years, who have made me so interest. Yes, the problem of the most German films are in this film "Gespenster" too. He is on some places to uncooked to be good to see. Special the figure of <PERSON>Toni</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sabine Timento</PERSON>) is too cool. But thats is in German films always so. Everybody must to learns this coolneÃŸ - is the realism in this films. Thats difficult to understand. But in this case it makes some sense, because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it, because you lose it. Thats not clear for the other girl <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> in this film. She love her - and she would lose her. But <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> lost everything. She will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling. There is no way - but you must take it said <PERSON>Herbert Achterbusch</PERSON> for twenty years. Thats so often the way it goes in German films. Why? <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> (<PERSON>Julia Hummer</PERSON>) is not inside of the laws of society - the is outside - and there she have no chance. This films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside. Thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination. Throw it all away - and go nowhere! But the actress plays this difficult part very interesting. On the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls. The have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera. But the film stand always in some distance to seem. There is no much explaining of them.<br /><br />In the center of this film, there is one scene you will never forget. The two girls got to a casting. And there they should say how they find together. In this scene <PERSON>Toni</PERSON> will lying on. She said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her. And then <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> will say the truth. She said it in an introversion way. There is no exhibition in it. She looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here. Thats a great moment. In the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than <PERSON>Toni</PERSON> goes away...<br /><br />Okay, The film will end - in the German way of coolneÃŸ - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing. But there was a moment - where is happening something else - and this moment was important. He is more than German coolneÃŸ - and this moments are rare in the German cinema in this time!
314 0 OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.
315 1 "Gespenster" (2005) forms, together with "Yella" (2007), and "<PERSON>Jerichow</PERSON>" (2008), the Gespenster-trilogy of director <PERSON>Christian Petzold</PERSON>, doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time.<br /><br />Roughly, "Gespenster" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> - and has never been seen ever. Since then, the mother keeps traveling to <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> whenever there is a possibility and searches, by aid of time-dilated photography, for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. As we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>. However, this time, when she meets <PERSON>Nina</PERSON>, everything comes quite different.<br /><br />The movie does not bring solutions, not even part-solutions, and insofar, it is rather disappointing. We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not, if her actual daughter is still alive or not. Most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the movie, it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> alone. The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed, can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex. in "Umberto D."), but in "Gespenster", it is displaced.<br /><br />Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie, let me give my own attempt: Why is it that similar persons do not know one another, especially not the persons that another similar person knows? This is quite an insane question, agreed, from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic, according to which the notion of the individual holds. The individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. So, the Aristotelian answer to my question is: They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. Everybody who is not insane, believes that. However, what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change, e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made, although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that. Despite our modern, Aristotelian world, the superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but rather diffusional, so that the borders between persons are open, such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind.
316 0 <ORGANIZATION>Warning Spoilers</ORGANIZATION> following. Superb recreation of the base in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, scandalous! Filmed in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring <PERSON>Susan Sarandon</PERSON> of all people! I can only assume that Canadian born director <PERSON>Roger Spottiswoode</PERSON> was coerced to make the <ORGANIZATION>USAF</ORGANIZATION> the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Kenn Borek Air</ORGANIZATION>.
317 1 I've seen this film more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. But then - this is part of <PERSON>Petzold</PERSON>'s game: he plays along with the rules of genre.<br /><br />It's very nice, how the highly improbable story of how the two girls (Timoteo/Hummer) meet, is again mirrored in another, even more improbable story, that the girls make up for a casting. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, it's more about potentials, things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future, than it is about actual ongoings. It's a reverie, sorts of - so apt enough there are a lot of motives, <PERSON>Freud</PERSON> might have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all the "doppelganger"-constellations. <br /><br />Also, I think, "Gespenster" might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current Asian cinema of the uncanny: <PERSON>Petzold</PERSON>'s everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive, strangely familiar way. This film is not about the obvious. To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphaned mother, who searches <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> for her lost daughter, clearly doesn't say much about the nature of "Gespenster" at all.
318 0 I have always admired <PERSON>Susan Sarandon</PERSON> for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. I therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts. Her character's rescue from the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION> was done by a Canadian charter company from <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION> flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip had been turned down by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Airforce</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> as beyond their capabilities. The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION> base. I feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task. I fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a <ORGANIZATION>USAF</ORGANIZATION> Hercules.
319 1 This was just another marvelous film of the Berlin Festival. But unlike "Yes", by <PERSON>Sally Potter</PERSON>, which I had seen some days before, where after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. It was as if, all of a sudden, there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken away to a dead place.<br /><br /><PERSON>Nina</PERSON>'s life seemed to be dismal and locked, but then, one lovely day, there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. There was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion, just out of nothing, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life. That person was <PERSON>Toni</PERSON>, a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots, just like herself.<br /><br />But the film's title is "Ghosts", and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to retain themÂ… Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself, hiding away from all other people. FranÃ§oise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts. She once lost her child daughter in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket, in just one moment of inattentiveness. Now time has passed, and FranÃ§oise is back in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, still looking for the missing child.<br /><br /><PERSON>Nina</PERSON> could be that child, after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity.<br /><br />And <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> adopts that idea, after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother. But in the end she is empty-handed, <PERSON>Toni</PERSON> has disappeared with a man, and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman. "<PERSON>Marie</PERSON> is dead," concludes FranÃ§oise's husband, and the statement could not be more disillusioning. <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> is just a "niÃ±a", a girl without name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. There is no <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> in this world to accompany our lonely lives. Therefore, in the end, we see <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> all alone, about to walk along the road that has opened up before her, into a future that seems joyless and uncertain.
320 0 I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "<PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>," "Wild <PERSON>Bill Hickok</PERSON>," and "Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>," all of whom are in this story! Add to the mix <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /><br />The trouble was.....it wasn't. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this, being bored to death. <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON>'s character was somewhat annoying and <PERSON>James Ellison</PERSON> just did not look like nor act like "<PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>." <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> wasn't at his best, either, sounding too wooden. This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor.<br /><br />In a nutshell, his western shot blanks. Head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one.
321 1 A funny comedy from beginning to end! There are several hilarious scenes but it's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me. Creative story line with a very talented cast. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
322 0 If you can imagine <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> as a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> street pimp, or <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> as a Communist spy, then you might believe <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON> as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and you could conceivably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />This film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. And the problem is that <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> made such a big deal about <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON>'s refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss <PERSON>Shirley Jones</PERSON> so you cannot build any anticipation for the "screen consummation" of their love. It's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns.<br /><br />The story is pointless. Even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm.<br /><br />April Love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
323 1 This silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences. Its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads. Chasing the big murder case, you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime. No nudity, but lots of sexual implication, slapstick silliness...everything adolescents go for. Low budget, but very entertaining. Definite cult classic potential.
324 0 a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot "surprises" at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the "plot" with steamy scenes they thought would help it along.<br /><br />james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie. the same applies for the other "actors". the plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring.<br /><br />however, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one.<br /><br />a rather lame 4!
325 1 For a "no budget" movie this thing rocks. I don't know if <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s gonna like it, but we were laughing all the way through. Some really Funny Funny stuff. Really non-Hollywood.<br /><br />The Actors and Music rocked. The cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up. Whooo Whooo!<br /><br />I've seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think I've seen in commercials or in something somewhere. Basically it Rocked! Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.
326 0 The earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite. Although <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> is an actor I generally like, his <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> often resembled a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances.
327 1 First-time director <PERSON>Tom Kiesche</PERSON> turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, yet had the flavor of the early Coen brother's film Blood Simple ... and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot! Needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor.
328 0 I'm not a huge <ORGANIZATION>Star Trek</ORGANIZATION> fan, but I was looking forward to this. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the Treks we are used to.<br /><br />I didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot. I found the plot to be convoluted and confusing.<br /><br />I will admit that I did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining.<br /><br />And that <ORGANIZATION>Vulcan</ORGANIZATION> babe had one hell of an incredible rack.<br /><br />But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series.<br /><br />3/10
329 1 Don't say I didn't warn you, but your gonna laugh. Probably enough to hurt your stomach. Sure it's got some blood splattering, all in good fun though. So, it's got no budget, who needs a budget when you got a script like this. <br /><br />Take the time and check this out. Well worth a two hour viewing. If everyone could laugh as much as I did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live.<br /><br />
330 0 While it's early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be. There is still potential for the series, however. Of course when I first saw Voyager I thought it had potential, too - but was sorely disappointed. My gut tells me Enterprise won't be as bad as Voyager, however.<br /><br />As for the impressions of the pilot...<br /><br />The pilot had some good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. The show's opening credits were interesting, with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song. <PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON> is excellent in the role of captain.<br /><br />Where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the "feel" of setting out on a grand adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more a "generic" Trek story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step towards space" merely subplot and subtext. Were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission, the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series.<br /><br /> The plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the "action". Instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that once again would make us THINK). Make us feel the excitement of "the wind" and being on "the sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay. There was WAY too much gunplay.<br /><br />We had the feeling more that humans were the "freshmen" in an established school. New kids on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. Sadly, the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them. That meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological. Just how DO two such different societies interact? Don't just hint about it, SHOW it!<br /><br />I had to think of it more as `Trek with an akward crew and limited technology' as opposed to `the first brave steps into the unknown'. I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept but so far I haven't seen this new, great concept.<br /><br />I will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. <PERSON>Bakula</PERSON> is wonderful. <PERSON>Blalock</PERSON> has potential. The overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme, we will have a show which will create new legends.<br /><br />You shoot an arrow into the air... Good luck Capt. <PERSON>Archer</PERSON>.<br /><br />To the producers: TAKE MORE RISKS AND MAKE US *THINK*! :-)
331 1 One of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear! Rather risquÃ© for 1931!
332 0 Okay first of all, I didn't sit down to watch the premier of a "Star Trek" Series to see a cowboy flying around in space. this is how a normal Enterprise episode works<br /><br />1 <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship.<br /><br />2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged...<br /><br />in all of the episodes I have seen, all of the problems are happening because of <PERSON>Archer</PERSON>'s stupid mistakes. Oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode but after that I totally gave up on Enterprise and turned to TV right off. Come on!!!! This is star trek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Also what was with the banana slug?? In one episode, <PERSON>Hoshi</PERSON> had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason. Okay fine, little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever. Okay that was what I thought until they left it on a desert planet!!!!! A BANANA SLUG CANNOT LEAVE IN A DESERT!!!!!!!!!!!! How dumb are these writers<br /><br />Any ways, just saying if Enterprise is on DON'T WATCH IT!!!!!
333 1 This was the first movie that <PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON> made together and they would go on to make several more. <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, <PERSON>William Bakewell</PERSON>, gets a job with <PERSON>Gable</PERSON>, who is a gangster and <PERSON>Bakewell</PERSON> thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> was a witness to the whole thing. It's a good movie but not one of their best.
334 0 Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The <PERSON>Borg</PERSON> does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the <LOCATION>Gamma</LOCATION> sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pilliar</PERSON> have made a mockery of <PERSON>Gene Roddenberry</PERSON>'s creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder <PERSON>Majel Barrett</PERSON> was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor <PERSON>Bakula</PERSON>. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).
335 1 "Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> plays a <PERSON>Bonnie Jordan</PERSON>, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, booze, and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming. This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (<PERSON>William Blakewell</PERSON>) penniless. <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> gets a job on a newspaper using the name <PERSON>Mary Smith</PERSON>; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. The head man is <PERSON>Jake Luva</PERSON> - portrayed by <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON> as he plays yet another crook. Later, of course, he would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early '30s, <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity, <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> cozies up to <PERSON>Luva</PERSON>.<br /><br />Gable and <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> made a great team. Her facial expressions are a little on the wild side, but that, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for <PERSON>Cliff Edwards</PERSON>, the voice of <ORGANIZATION>Jiminy Cricket</ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON>Bert</PERSON>.<br /><br />It's always interesting to see the precode movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
336 0 Despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential. Set as a prequel to the original "Star Trek" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, <PERSON>Rick Berman</PERSON>, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a "Star Trek" series could be (which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint). The actual show-runner, <PERSON>Brannon Braga</PERSON>, didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck). Never have I seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors (<PERSON>Jolene Blaylock</PERSON> excepted)last so long. It is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires. Unfortunately it appears as if <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Braga</PERSON> have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off. Produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come.<br /><br />Simply put, In a TeeVee universe where we are given shows like "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield" the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a "Star Trek" that measures up and is dramatically competitive. It is just that straightforward and easy.
337 1 This is one of <PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON>'s best Talkies. It was the first Gable-Crawford pairing, and made it evident to <LOCATION>MGM</LOCATION> and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars.<br /><br />The film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must fend for themselves and work for a living. Life is hard in the Depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity. <br /><br /><PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON> is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll. She's smart, complex, and believable. She even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early Talkie acting style. <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON> is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>'s character. The same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite <PERSON>Norma Shearer</PERSON> in "A Free Soul", securing his position as top male sex symbol at <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br />If you like <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> in this type of role, don't miss "Paid", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early Talkie performances.<br /><br />
338 0 I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I said to him," You've got to be kidding. Is this some sort of joke?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda movie made for children?" The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your DVD or Video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had made Razzies in the '40s, this would have won in every category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious sobriquet of "Stairway to Heaven.")
339 1 <PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON> had just begun her "working girl makes good" phase with the dynamic "Paid" (1930). She had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed. So while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering (because they were clinging to characters that had been the "in" thing a few years before but were now becoming passe) <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress. The depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon. Of course, if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alright.<br /><br />This film starts out with a spectacular house boat party. <PERSON>Bonnie Jordan</PERSON> (<PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON>) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear!!! However, when <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON>'s father has a heart attack, because of loses on the stock market, both <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> and her brother, <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON> (<PERSON>William Bakewell</PERSON>) realise who their real friends are. After <PERSON>Bob Townsend</PERSON> (<PERSON>Lester Vail</PERSON> - a poor man's <PERSON>Johnny Mack Brown</PERSON>) offers to do the "right thing" and marry her - they had just spent a night together when <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> declared (with abandon) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job.<br /><br />She finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well. Her working buddy is <PERSON>Bert Scranton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Cliff Edwards</PERSON>) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob. <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON> also surprises her with the news that he also has a job. She is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer, <PERSON>Jake Luva</PERSON> (<PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON>). <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON> witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces, "spilling the beans" to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be <PERSON>Bert</PERSON>. He is then forced to kill <PERSON>Bert</PERSON> and after- wards he goes into hiding. The paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find <PERSON>Bert</PERSON>'s killer and sends <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> undercover as a dancer in one of <PERSON>Jake</PERSON>'s clubs. (<PERSON>Joan</PERSON> does a very lively dance to "Accordian Joe" - much to <PERSON>Sylvie</PERSON>'s disgust). The film ends with a gun battle and as <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON> lies dying, <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> tearfully phones in her story.<br /><br />This is a super film with <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> and Gable giving it their all. <PERSON>Natalie Moorehead</PERSON>, who as <PERSON>Sylvie</PERSON> shared a famous "cigarette scene" with Gable early in the film, was a stylish "other woman" who had her vogue in the early thirties. <PERSON>William Bakewell</PERSON> had a huge career (he had started as a teenager in a Douglas Fairbanks film in the mid 20s). A lot of his roles though were weak, spineless characters. In this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by <PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON> and the dynamic newcomer <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON> - maybe that was why he never became a star.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
340 0 Viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now THAT is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me folks, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see, and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor.<br /><br /><PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> plays a doomed and bravado-besotted <ORGANIZATION>RAF</ORGANIZATION> pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic...) Of course, he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. (They immediately clinch).<br /><br />Looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts, (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies'), the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. We get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like 'em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb...<br /><br />As for the quality of the production, the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor, (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that), and foreshadowing, (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera).<br /><br />The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it's all downhill. The (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the <ORGANIZATION>Odessa Steps</ORGANIZATION>, to say the least, and I'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account. The movie overall is bad enough to be funny, and that's about the best thing I can say for it.
341 1 Don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one, this is a gem! Young rich <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living! She, naturally, becomes a reporter, and he, just as naturally, a driver for the mob! By wild co-incidences their careers meet head on, thanks to gangster <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON>. In the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> to do a couple of risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam-shovel).<br /><br />But none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's all good fun from those wonderful pre-code days, when <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> was really naughty. <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> looks great, and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank God she stopped the dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero. Great to see him playing something different. And <PERSON>William Bakewell</PERSON> is excellent as the poor confused brother. And there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director <PERSON>Harry Beaumont</PERSON>, who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! Great fun!
342 0 I thought <PERSON>Hedy Burress</PERSON> (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 Guess not. I just think they should of killed her off like in Friday The 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean).<br /><br />This movie like Scream 3, and Urban Legend 2 followed movies within a movie.<br /><br />This was PURE CRAP! The whole Movie within a Movie crap.<br /><br />BAD STAY AWAY!
343 1 I disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as "just" entertainment. Set right after the carefree, roaring 20s, during the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale, with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times. Yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.<br /><br />In the 30s, <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> had a knack for churning out one entertaining *and* enlightening audience-pleaser after another, all without wasting a frame of film. Dance, Fools, Dance -- one of *four* films that <PERSON>Harry Beaumont</PERSON> directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.<br /><br />With the lone exception of <PERSON>Lester Vail</PERSON> as flaccid love interest <PERSON>Bob Townsend</PERSON>, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Worthy of note are <PERSON>William Bakewell</PERSON> as <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Cliff Edwards</PERSON> (best known as the voice of <ORGANIZATION>Jiminy Cricket</ORGANIZATION>) as reporter <PERSON>Bert Scranton</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON> in an early supporting role as gangster <PERSON>Jake Luva</PERSON>.<br /><br />But this is <PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON>'s film, and she absolutely shines in it. Made when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work. However, here is proof that long before she took home an Oscar for <PERSON>Mildred Pierce</PERSON>, <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> was a star in the true sense of the word, a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.<br /><br />Score: EIGHT out of TEN
344 0 Return to Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION> does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (<PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>) returning for the sequal, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the story line and acting was really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and <PERSON>Blair Witch</PERSON> were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just detract from the first.
345 1 I saw this movie on Comedy Central a few times. This movie was pretty good. It's an interesting adventure with the life of <PERSON>Sunny Davis</PERSON>, who is arranged to marry the king of <LOCATION>Ohtar</LOCATION>, so that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can get an army base there to balance power in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate." I also just loved the ending theme. It gave me great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
346 0 A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(<PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON>)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.
347 1 Actually, <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> is from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Takoma Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>), but I digress. This is sort of a Mr. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> goes to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> type of movie, with some variations but the same premise. I taped this movie off of cable years ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life. It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). It made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up. And the speech she made at the end...beautiful. Too bad not many people have guts like that in real life.
348 0 *Possible Spoiler*<br /><br />'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting.<br /><br />'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON> was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this. It seemed as if HE wasn't even interested in doing the sequel. His acting was good but it could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion, they're not even worth mentioning. But I'll do it. The character of <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film. All of a sudden she's the center of attention next to <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Caldwell</ORGANIZATION>. The role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better. <PERSON>Dahlia Salem</PERSON> was absolutely terrible. Her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else, anybody else. The director, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON>, was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary. The acting for this role was good, nothing great but better than <LOCATION>Salem</LOCATION>'s.<br /><br />The plot was real lousy if you think about it. <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the set of 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his script. He stumbles upon the director and in a short time, the director is dead and <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> is running the show. Yeah, out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him. There's some killings, not a whole lot, and the one's that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character gets chewed up by a motorboat. And one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been hard up for excitement.<br /><br />I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast. Also, the new cabin by the lake was poorly created. We aren't shown it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more, but it didn't work in this one.<br /><br />There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them except for a few had no reason to be there. The acting of what little is showed was really bad and...they just didn't have a purpose in this movie.<br /><br />All in all, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off. 'Cabin by the Lake' I can take but this was just not impressive. <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON> should have avoided this one and so should you. It's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep.<br /><br />So, we see that <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> defies death and is still alive and well. By the way he talks, it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself. Quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright!<br /><br />(Did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one? They were all done in a tank. Never, never reveal the secrets of filming.)<br /><br />
349 1 Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> area, is a bit dim, to put in mildly. She drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple. However, she saves the life of a prominent Arab, by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official. She charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks. Sniffing an opportunity, Presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government. Even then, she messes things up at times, but she tries hard and learns a lot. She even grabs the romantic attention of a <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> department official. But, is there another sinister plot in the making, involving an Arab man who wishes to take another wife? A blonde one? LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie features <PERSON>Goldie</PERSON> as pretty as a picture and as dumb "as a fox", as they say. Sunny learns her way around the jungle of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government very, very well. She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings. Perhaps, the Arab community would be less than thrilled with this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent this today.
350 0 I watched <LOCATION>Cabin by the Lake</LOCATION> this afternoon on <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION>. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in <LOCATION>Cabin</LOCATION> by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION> was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION> being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
351 1 A pretty average movie but a brave one from Ms Hawn to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer & as a starring vehicle. Although she ends up vindicated, she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo. How many other A listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie? Not many. Does this mean the female butt cannot be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects other won't. <PERSON>Sandra Bullock</PERSON> occasionally goes there,for example, Miss Congeniality but <PERSON>Nicole Kidman</PERSON> would never cop the pratfall. A wonderful performer. Great to see some of my favorite actors, <PERSON>Chris Sarandon</PERSON> & Cliff DeYoung notably.
352 0 <br /><br />I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came on right after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking.<br /><br />---SPOILERS--- Okay... It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to "look real when they died"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... I would watch a "Cabin by the Lake 3". Only because I like <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON>, and he's the only good part about this sequal.
353 1 BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was okay. <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chris Sarandon</PERSON> were the best two in it. Okay, so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. This guy's boss was good, too. But the movie really belonged to <PERSON>Sarandon</PERSON> and Hawn. These two should have had a lot more time on screen together. They're chemistry was great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy.<br /><br />Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. To talk about <PERSON>Sarandon</PERSON> would be to give a lot away. SPOILERS This is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy, and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic. It touches on political issues, and just barely skims on romantic areas.<br /><br />
354 0 IF you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually post my comments about something I've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it. I will just simply say, please do not ever see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it WILL be a waste of yours. Anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!
355 1 This is a feel-good movie and nothing more. And for that, it is great fun to watch. Sure it skims over political issues. But so what? I am sure she wasn't trying to make 'Good Night and Good Luck' here. Let's not try to make it anything else but what it is...light fare. <br /><br />And very enjoyable at that!<br /><br />Do we remember what 1984 was like? We've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not. I tend to differ on this point. Goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it.<br /><br />Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Seems Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes Her, <ORGANIZATION>First Wives Club</ORGANIZATION> and the remake of Out-of-Towners, <ORGANIZATION>GOLDIE</ORGANIZATION> knows what she is doing...she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie just knows herself really well, and she knows what she can do really well.<br /><br />She has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she's ever been in. She has never tried to be anything else but who she is...and that's that bubbling, giggly, girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it...you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments. If it even comes that late.<br /><br />I appreciate <PERSON>Goldie</PERSON> for what she is: a lovable, comic actress.
356 0 This movie was made-for-TV, so taking that into account, I'm not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.<br /><br />The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.<br /><br />Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it.
357 1 "Protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting Arab from an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity, and gets a new job working for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Government. Will the corridors of power in our nation's capital ever be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual even though "Protocol" isn't as funny as her best film "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I did laugh alot.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
358 0 Return to <LOCATION>Cabin</LOCATION> by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the "home video" type effect! <br /><br />I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original <ORGANIZATION>CBTL</ORGANIZATION> because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.
359 1 The first "side-story" in the universal century Gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies. The focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict, but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes.<br /><br />The story does contain some Gundam staples, its premise being the attempts by a <ORGANIZATION>ZEON</ORGANIZATION> squad to capture an experimental Gundam, but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch. This series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> and the relationship between his neighbor, <PERSON>Christina Mckenzie</PERSON> who is secretly a <ORGANIZATION>Federation</ORGANIZATION> pilot and a newbie Zeon pilot named <PERSON>Bernie Wiseman</PERSON>. <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> develops a sort of "brotherly love" for <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> while our young Zeon pilot also falls for <PERSON>Christina</PERSON>.<br /><br />"War in the Pocket" proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story. There are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here. This short 6 episode OVA focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are. <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool. He is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war. The unlikely friendship and bonding between <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christina</PERSON>, each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war, is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff. Same goes for the endearing relationship between <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>. That being said, i would not want to spoil much of the story here, but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending. <br /><br />Despite its lack of action, this show never falls into the category of "boring". The characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show. Not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there. Each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an OVA and are sure to satisfy the craving for some "mandatory" mobile suit battles in a Gundam series.<br /><br />Normally watching anime in Japanese or English, i would leave up to personal preference. But in this case, i strongly recommend the English voice track over the Japanese one. Not only do the characters, whom all except <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> are caucasian, sound more believable in English but the performances of the English voice cast are on par and even surpass the Japanese one, instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action TV dramas.<br /><br />In short, this show does not try to impress the audience. What it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child. A truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given.
360 0 Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath <PERSON>Stanley Kaldwell</PERSON> returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.<br /><br />Film pokes gleeful fun at <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. <PERSON>Brian Krause</PERSON>, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, <PERSON>Alison</PERSON>(..played by <PERSON>Dahlia Salem</PERSON>)seem to be taking over the production. <PERSON>Andrew Moxham</PERSON> is <PERSON>Paul Parsons</PERSON>, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> realizes who <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> really is. <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director <PERSON>Po-Chih Leong</PERSON> uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.
361 1 When Gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with, a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else. This OVA is kinda the opposite. Though there're only half a dozen episodes, it isn't filled with action, but emotional things. The two main action sequences in this, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many gundam series, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie. This movie did a fantastic job of that. What makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people. It made the Zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>. Most people that don't like anime that I've forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. So, I'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story. If you're a Gundam fan, and haven't seen this, you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now.
362 0 Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was "Return To Cabin By The Lake" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been warned.
363 1 UC 0079, the One Year War is almost at an end. A neutral colony of Side 6 has been targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon task force. Their target, a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for <PERSON>Amuro Ray</PERSON> from the original Gundam saga) inside. When little boy <PERSON>Al Izuruha</PERSON>, a fan of Zeon MS, encounters a Zaku after battle breaks out in the colony, he befriends newbie MS pilot <PERSON>Benard</PERSON> "<PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>" <PERSON>Wiseman</PERSON>. The two become good friends, <PERSON>Al</PERSON> is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> acts as a father figure to Al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot <PERSON>Christina McKenzie</PERSON>, but eventually they must meet....in battle. <PERSON>Al</PERSON> soon learns that war is not child's play and <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission.<br /><br />For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well done show. The mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters. If you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look to a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle. I would rate it more of a drama than action.<br /><br />Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /><br />Sometimes you have to lose to win.
364 0 This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.<br /><br />Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.
365 1 If you are uninitiated to the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you are burned out on Star Wars or Star Trek, here is a compelling, realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in. Not the simplistic boy-saves-world-in-giant robot story you might have expected, but rather a complex, emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "good" and "bad" guys is decidedly less than distinct.<br /><br />Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of <PERSON>Al Izuruha</PERSON>, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days daydreaming about Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. During the course of this series, <PERSON>Al</PERSON> befriends an "enemy" soldier, <PERSON>Bernie Wiseman</PERSON>. By the end, little <PERSON>Al</PERSON> learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.<br /><br />I loved this OAV series, with its cool mecha designs, involving story, and likeable characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF anime, or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.
366 0 This is an action Western. <PERSON>James Steart</PERSON> leads an all star cast in the scenic <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old <LOCATION>Nothwest</LOCATION>.<br /><br />The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> has always made into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.<br /><br />However, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad).<br /><br />Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Royal Dano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harry Morgan</PERSON>, and others make this worth watching.
367 1 Exquisite comedy starring <PERSON>Marian Davies</PERSON> (with the affable <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>). Young <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> seeking stardom. Cameo performances showcase "all the stars in <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION>'s heaven" in the famous commissary scene, plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar. Pic also captures for posterity <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' famous, wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day (her <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON> is a beaut!).<br /><br />"<PERSON>Peggy</PERSON>," even catches herself as she encounters the famous star <PERSON>Marian Davies</PERSON> at tennis, turns up her nose and comments, "Ohh, I don't like her!"<br /><br />My print was perfect. Story, direction, acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados.
368 0 <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> photographs the <LOCATION>Alberta Rocky Mountains</LOCATION> in a superb fashion, and <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> - a Mountie telling the people of <LOCATION>Dawson City</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Yukon</PERSON> to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the <LOCATION>Klondike</LOCATION> gold rush. Mr. <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> and company appear to have mistaken <LOCATION>Dawson City</LOCATION> for <PERSON>Deadwood</PERSON>, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.
369 1 There are no people like "Show People" <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> (as <PERSON>Peggy Pepper</PERSON>) and <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> (as <PERSON>Billy Boone</PERSON>). My introduction to Ms. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> was a "clip" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> was in viewing this film, presently; though, it's possible I've seen him in a less memorable role. <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> makes an incredible impression, when he joins <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table. Indeed, <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> and <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> deliver great comic performances.<br /><br />The story starts off with <PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON> (Colonel Pepper) driving daughter <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> into <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, certain she will become <LOCATION>Tinseltown</LOCATION>'s newest sensation. Indeed, <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> and the already arrived <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> become comedy stars. But, <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> yearns to become a true drama queen. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> leaves <PERSON>Haines</PERSON>, and partners up with the dashingly dramatic <PERSON>Paul Ralli</PERSON>. But, audiences prefer <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> in more comic roles; perhaps director <PERSON>King Vidor</PERSON> is offering up a case for art imitating life? <br /><br />Full of great <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> location footage, both on the set, and off. Full of great "cameos"; at a studio lunch, at the stars' table, <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> sits between <PERSON>Douglas Fairbanks</PERSON> and <PERSON>William S. Hart</PERSON>. The best "bit" player, however, is <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>, who has enough nerve to ask <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> for her autograph! While the cameos are fun, they, and the episodic sequences, do help "Show People" become less of an important film, and more of an important historical document. <br /><br />******** Show People (11/11/28) King <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON> ~ <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON>
370 0 The five or so really good westerns that <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> made are unequaled as an ensemble in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. Even <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON> never made that many with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are. <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s My <PERSON>Darling Clementine</PERSON> is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. <br /><br />The real hero of them besides <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant <LOCATION>Red River</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Chase</PERSON> wrote far country, bend of the river, and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as My <PERSON>Darling Clementine</PERSON>, but then very few films, western or otherwise are. <br /><br />Each of the five films of <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> have huge gaps, or is it six, lets see. Bend, Far, Man of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, Furies, <ORGANIZATION>Winchester</ORGANIZATION> 73, and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene, with fairly glaring lapses. Yet so does <LOCATION>Red River</LOCATION>, which is still the single greatest western ever made. So perfection isn't everything. <br /><br />But The Far Country has huge, huge holes. It's mawkish, and really comes alive only when <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> and Mc Entire are locking horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s camera. <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s camera is a one man course in cinematography. It is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film. It is almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /><br />The Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual it comes from <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>. Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man. He is absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, <PERSON>Winchester</PERSON>, and Man from <LOCATION>Laramie</LOCATION>: in Bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from <LOCATION>Dachau</LOCATION>, in Far he is shot off a raft with such violence, it looks so convincing that you wince, and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man, well you find yourself looking for the burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in <LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION> when he is beaten up early in the hotel room, also as well as anybody ever did it. <br /><br />But that was <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s territory: look at <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> fighting with <PERSON>Jack Lord</PERSON> in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> while not being quite as convincing as <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>. <br /><br />What a great, great director. <br /><br />See every western he ever made. They are his real monuments, even if all are scetchy. But so what. When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody, including <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone, period.<br /><br />Thanks, <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>.
371 1 I finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of "Show People". I cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters, plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words. Seeing the cameo, out-of-character appearances of so many M-G-M silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself. I really like the scene where <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie, <PERSON>Patricia Pepoire</PERSON>. Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> but it is something to the effect of "I don't think I like her!" Pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history. Enjoy!
372 0 I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of Canadian history, particularly the disservice done to the history of the Mounted Police in the Yukon.<br /><br />I'll leave it to <PERSON>Pierre Berton</PERSON>, noted historian, born and raised in <LOCATION>Dawson City Yukon</LOCATION>, and author of the definitive history of the Klondike gold rush, <PERSON>Klondike</PERSON>: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /><br />The American idea of an untamed frontier, subdued by individual heroes armed with six-guns, was continued in The Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the American west - <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> this time - driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns Â– that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness. When <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs shack is empty.<br /><br />"Where is the constable? asks <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON>.<br /><br />"Up on the <LOCATION>Pelly River</LOCATION>. Trouble with the Chilkats," someone replies. He's got a real tough job, that constable. He patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time." <br /><br />The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> has ever seen. The <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Mounted Police</ORGANIZATION> was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every route into the Yukon and they brooked no nonsense. They collected customs duties, often over the wails of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation, and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies, or if they simply looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they laid down moral laws for the community. In <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on Sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern-faced police called "giving a risquÃ© performance in the theatre," generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.<br /><br />In such a community, a gunbelt was unthinkable. One notorious bad man from Tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable, who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over. "No man has yet taken a gun away from me," said the American. "Well, I'm taking it", the constable said mildly and did so, without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece.<br /><br />In 1898, the big year of the stampede, there wasn't a serious crime Â– let alone a murder Â– in <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. The contrast with <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> on the American side, which was a lawless town run by <PERSON>Soapy Smith</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> confidence man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> is seen as a community without any law, which a <PERSON>Soapy Smith</PERSON> character from <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> Â– he is called <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> in the picture Â– can easily control. (In real life, one of <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant).<br /><br />{in the movie the lone Mountie says} "Yes I'm the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it."<br /><br />"Then why aren't there more of you?"<br /><br />"Because yesterday this was a wilderness. We didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands. Now that you're here, we'll protect you."<br /><br />"When?"<br /><br />"There'll be a post established here in <LOCATION>Dawson</LOCATION> early in May."<br /><br />"What happens between now and May? You going to be here to keep order?"<br /><br />"Part of the time."<br /><br />"What about the rest of the time?"<br /><br />"Pick yourselves a good man. Swear him in. Have him act as marshalÂ…"<br /><br />The movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. His astonishing suggestion Â– that an American town marshal, complete with tin star, be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence Â– is accepted. Naturally they want to make <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> the marshal; he clearly fits the part. But <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is playing the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so another man is elected to get shot. And he does. Others get shot. Even <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> gets shot. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own. He pins on the tin star and he and the bully, <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>, blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax.<br /><br />To anybody with a passing knowledge of the Canadian north, this bald re-telling of the story passes rational belief. <br /><br />Â…excerpt from <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, by <PERSON>Pierre Berton</PERSON>, 1975.
373 1 There are some wonderful things about this movie. <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> could act, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men. (Until a potential scandal forced him from the business).<br /><br />The story is a bit trite, but handled so beautifully that you don't notice. King <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON>'s direction is one of the principle reasons for this. The producer? The boy genius, <PERSON>Irving Thalberg</PERSON>.<br /><br />It's about movie making, and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors directing and actors emoting. You get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON> does a turn as himself, seeking an autograph. You also catch glimpses of <PERSON>Eleanor Boardman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elinor Glyn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Claire Windsor</PERSON>, <PERSON>King Vidor</PERSON>, and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs.<br /><br />Please, even if you're not a fan of the silents, take the time to catch this film when you can. It's really a terrific trip back in time.
374 0 Sorry, gave it a 1, which is the rating I give to movies on which I walk out or fall asleep. In this case I fell asleep 10 minutes from the end, really, really bored and not caring at all about what happened next.
375 1 <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> stars in this remarkable comedy "Show People" released by <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> in 1928. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> plays a hick from <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, who arrives in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> with her father (<PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON>). The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> outrageous southern costume. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow slapstick star <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>, who is immediately smitten with her. Well, <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. A handsome but fake actor (<PERSON>Andre Telefair</PERSON>) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> star. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a "serious" actress. <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by <PERSON>Charles Chaplin</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Gilbert</PERSON>, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON>. This is a silent film with a few "sound effects" as sound pictures were just coming into their own. A treasure of a film.
376 0 This movie has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately it has no plot. In order to have a plot there must be a conflict. This movie had none. It spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it. The picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling.<br /><br />If you love <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story. There isn't one.
377 1 I'm a huge classic film buff, but am just getting in to silent movies. A lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but Show People is a notable exception.<br /><br /><PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> and <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> are simply wonderful in this picture. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously.<br /><br />Show People is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The movie captured my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary.<br /><br />Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It is a fast paced, interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars. Add in the satire of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and Show People should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs.

379 1 1928 is in many ways a "lost year" in motion pictures. Just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology.<br /><br />"Show People" is one of the great silent era comedies. The film shows that <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. This movie is also exhibit A for illustrating that <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> was no <PERSON>Susan Alexander Kane</PERSON>. She had excellent comic instincts and timing. This film starts out as the Beverly Hillbillies-like adventure of <PERSON>Peggy Pepper</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>) and her father, General <PERSON>Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper</PERSON>, fresh from the old <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>. General <PERSON>Pepper</PERSON> has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. While at the studio commissary, the Peppers run into <PERSON>Billy Boone</PERSON> (<PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>), a slapstick comedian. He gets <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> an acting job. She's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. Soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn't really love, unless fate somehow intervenes.<br /><br />One of the things <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> circa 1930. This film is one of those, as we get <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON> trying to get <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON>'s autograph, an abundance of cameos of <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> players during that era including director <PERSON>King Vidor</PERSON> himself, and even a cameo of <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> as <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> seeing <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> as <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> arriving at work on the lot. <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her. Truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while. This is one of the films that I also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible.
380 0 I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.
381 1 I had seen <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal. She couldn't dance for peanuts, she didn't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance. But I hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful. Rather than kidding her own image, as has been suggested here, to me it seems a satire on <PERSON>Gloria Swanson</PERSON>, who did start off in slapstick comedies, went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a Count. <PERSON>Marion</PERSON>, a top mimic, also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand, that was <PERSON>Gloria Swanson</PERSON> spot on!!!<br /><br />Colonel Pepper (<PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON>) has motored all the way from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, determined to prove that his daughter, <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON>, (<PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>) will be the greatest star ever. Their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet <PERSON>Billy Boone</PERSON> (<PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> a job. <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic. They convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success. <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON> asks for her autograph but she doesn't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely. "Who was that short little guy" - when she finds out she faints!!! <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> get a call from High Art Studio but only <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> is wanted and suddenly she is on her way. There is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't think much of - it's <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>!!!<br /><br />She finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress - but she can't cry!!! It is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds, she can't stop!!! Her new leading man, <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> (<PERSON>Paul Ralli</PERSON>) convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated - she even adopts a new name - <PERSON>Patricia Pepoire</PERSON>!!! She also seems to have forgotten <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> and her dad - she has developed a "STAR" personality!!! When the slapstick studio picks the same location as "Patricia's" movie, <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude. When she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew. <br /><br />After a studio luncheon ( a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day) "<PERSON>Patricia</PERSON>" gets a call from the Boss. It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> back. She and <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> decide to get married, she dreams of being a Countess (even though <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a Count than he is). On her wedding day, <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> is the one for her.<br /><br />It was amazing to see all the guest stars - <PERSON>John Gilbert</PERSON> is seen going through the <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> gates, <PERSON>Lew Cody</PERSON> is talking to <PERSON>Elinor Glynn</PERSON>, who not only wrote "It" but several racy romances that were made into <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> movies. <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>, another actor whose movies I had always wanted to see, was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing. <PERSON>Harry Gribbon</PERSON> was hilarious as the comedy director - there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> was at the top of them all - I'm giving this film 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.
382 0 ... to not live in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />"A river runs through it" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> acting well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />Definitely NOT a must-see (3 / 10)<br /><br />
383 1 Back in the day if <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> had had her druthers and didn't just listen to <PERSON>William Randolph Hearst</PERSON>, she'd have done more films like Show People and been a lot happier. In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy, she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In <PERSON>Flower</PERSON> and <PERSON>Janice Meredith</PERSON>. <br /><br />What you're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>, a gifted comedienne, a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person. She could really identify with the character of <PERSON>Peggy Pepper</PERSON> aka <PERSON>Patricia Prepoire</PERSON>, she put up with her share of pretense in her <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> stardom.<br /><br />If the plot of Show People was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story. I guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story. <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> is eager young hopeful who arrives in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> like so many others, looking for that big break. She wants to drama, but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics. She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. And also wins the heart of young comic actor <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>.<br /><br />She does get her first big break, but it doesn't come for <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> as well and <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> does get to do legitimate drama with actor <PERSON>Paul Ralli</PERSON>, playing <PERSON>Andre Telfair</PERSON>, a pretend no account Count of <LOCATION>Avignon</LOCATION>. Somebody here was taking a shot at actor <PERSON>Lou Tellegen</PERSON>, lover and husband of <PERSON>Sarah Bernhardt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Geraldine Farrar</PERSON> and others and to hear tell of it, one of the most despised people in cinema.<br /><br />Show People was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves. You will get to see folks like <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Douglas Fairbanks</PERSON>, <PERSON>William S. Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mae Murray</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Gilbert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eleanor Boardman</PERSON> etc., just being themselves in and around the film colony. That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving.<br /><br />Show People also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like, Ain't We Got Fun, I'm Sitting On Top Of The World, You'd Be Surprised, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, Here I Come. As the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced, a song called Crossroads was introduced in it. It's not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack. I guess since they're not seen, it was felt no billing was necessary. Still I'd like to know and I'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see Show People.<br /><br />It's easy to see why <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite. She looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience.
384 0 The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>). So Norm becomes a teacher and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> becomes a compulsive gambler who <PERSON>Norm</PERSON> wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.<PERSON>Paul</PERSON> make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.
385 1 Prior to seeing Show People, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only. I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls. But this masterful film proved me wrong. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>, in my view, was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>. I mention <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> primarily because <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that I wonder if <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> wasn't one of Ball's primary influences. This is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy, and I must say that no matter how much of the period-specific references you actually get (I didn't, apparently), you will not be bored by this movie. You will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
386 0 The story by <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON> is a masterwork; <PERSON>Redford</PERSON>'s film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>, trying to play the charismatic <PERSON>Paul Maclean</PERSON>, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, <PERSON>Tom Skerritt</PERSON> as the father and <PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON> as <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
387 1 Sunday July 16, 8:00pm The <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION><br /><br />"As a Southern colonel your make-up is very <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>"<br /><br />The yammering gossips of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> have managed to sling more than a little mud in <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> direction over the years. That she had fame handed to her and was undeserving, is often speculated. Considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into, this criticism would seem to have some validity. As a comedienne however, her star shone very brightly. Left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled <PERSON>Mabel Normand</PERSON>. One of her better outings was King <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON>'s Show People (1928), which survives and is so well known largely because <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> filled it with star cameos. This happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars, <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> and that notorious <PERSON>Joe College wise-cracker</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>. Rumor has it Show People was loosely based on the life of <PERSON>Gloria Swanson</PERSON>, who began in <LOCATION>Sennett</LOCATION> comedies and rose to grand drama (And don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone!) with <PERSON>von Stroheim</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and <PERSON>DeMille</PERSON>. Coincidentally, the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION> had abandoned the year before (Think of who worked there!).<br /><br />Colonel <PERSON>Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper</PERSON> (<PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON>) drives his daughter <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> (<PERSON>Davies</PERSON>) from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> to star in the movies. These two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible <PERSON>Billy Boone</PERSON> (<PERSON>Haines</PERSON>), " Â– a custard pie artist Â…" who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance (watch for the bit with the noodle), and then helps <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> land a part in his next picture. What she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball, but a job is a job and <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> convinces her " . . all the stars have to take it on the chin Â– ". At the preview, <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> bump into Â….. <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>, who asks for her autograph! She pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> grabs the book and makes her sign. <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON> climbs in his car and <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> who shes just snubbed, so naturally, she faints. It's so very funny, considering <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> character isn't supposed to recognize this guy! <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> soon moves on to work at the <ORGANIZATION>High Art Studios</ORGANIZATION>, changes her name to '<PERSON>Patricia Pepoire</PERSON>' and leaves poor <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> behind. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress, with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips. <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON> throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot (and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder, facing the camera!) that includes <PERSON>Polly Moran</PERSON> (Who's also sensationally funny playing <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' maid), <PERSON>Louella Parsons</PERSON> (one of the friendly vampires), <PERSON>Estelle Taylor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Claire Windsor Aileen Pringle</PERSON>, the comedy duo of <PERSON>Karl Dane</PERSON> (with his arm in a sling) and <PERSON>George K. Arthur</PERSON> (pretending he's stealing the silverware), <PERSON>Leatrice Joy</PERSON> (amused by <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>'s antics), <PERSON>Renee Adoree</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rod</PERSON> (eating and smoking) <PERSON>La Rocque</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mae Murray</PERSON>, <PERSON>John</PERSON> (in a robe) <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> (who also appears driving through the <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> gates early in the picture), <PERSON>Norma</PERSON> (eeeww!) <PERSON>Talmadge</PERSON> (looking bitchy and aloof as usual) and <PERSON>Patricia</PERSON> dressed like <PERSON>Marie Antoinette</PERSON>, sandwiched between <PERSON>Douglas Fairbanks</PERSON> (as he does an amusing trick) and <PERSON>William S. Hart</PERSON> (protecting her from <PERSON>Doug</PERSON>). <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> runs into the High Art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming, with predictably nutty results. <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON> even works himself into the final scene as the director of <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON>'s current production. Also worth noting are <PERSON>Harry Gribbon</PERSON> as the comedy director doing a great caricature of <PERSON>Eddie Sedgwick</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sidney Bracy</PERSON> as the dramatic director who can't get <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does, and <PERSON>Paul Ralli</PERSON> as <PERSON>Andre</PERSON>, her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony. When her character tries to 'act' its as though <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it.<br /><br />While it's true Show People is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence, it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Irving Thalberg</PERSON>, and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent. What a shame so much has been lost. There are also far too many examples of great films like The <PERSON>Patsy</PERSON> (1928), <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year, languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed.
388 0 This film, The <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION>:Thirteen Days to Glory, is utter rubbish. The acting is awful, it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (Historians would have a field day). It does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long. Rating * out of **********.
389 1 Perhaps the funniest 'backstage at <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>' movie ever, especially for a look at comedy short factories like <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role. Plenty of cameos for film buffs.
390 0 Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> during the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> fight for independence from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON> as <PERSON>Jim Bowie</PERSON>. <PERSON>Brian Keith</PERSON> as <PERSON>Davy Crockett</PERSON>. <PERSON>Alec Baldwin</PERSON> as Col. <PERSON>Travis</PERSON>. <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> as General <PERSON>Santa Anna</PERSON>. This made-for-TV project also stars <PERSON>David Ogden Stiers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kathleen York</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Metzler</PERSON>. Very good original music by <PERSON>Peter Bernstein</PERSON>.
391 1 "Show People" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by <PERSON>King Vidor</PERSON> and starring <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> and <PERSON>Billy Haines</PERSON>. What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, <PERSON>Peggy Pepper</PERSON>, whose acting is the talk of <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> trying to make it on the big screen. Though she's a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make "art" so she moves up to <LOCATION>High Arts Studio</LOCATION>. Soon she becomes <PERSON>Patricia Pepoire</PERSON> and is too good for the likes of her friend <PERSON>Billy</PERSON>.<br /><br />Many stars of the silent era have cameos in "Show People," including <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> herself without the curly hair and makeup. I'm sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly, nowadays, it's not the case, even for film buffs. In one part of the film, however, she does meet <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>; in another, author <PERSON>Elinor Glyn</PERSON> is pointed out to her, and <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON> himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars who pop up in "Show People" are <PERSON>John Gilbert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Douglas Fairbanks</PERSON>, <PERSON>William S. Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leatrice Joy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bess Flowers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Renee Adoree</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rod LaRoque</PERSON>, <PERSON>Aileen Pringle</PERSON>, and many others.<br /><br /><PERSON>Davies</PERSON> was adorable and a lively comedienne. It's a shame <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> quit the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly an enormous star back in the day.<br /><br />"Show People" is a simple story told in a witty way. It's also a look back at an exciting era in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.
392 0 This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on <LOCATION>Hollywood Squares</LOCATION>. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>'s or <PERSON>Fess Parker</PERSON>'s versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid it.
393 1 This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>. She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film. (I believe that <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> may have modeled her later career on <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' style, that could be termed "zany beauty".) <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON>'s direction is light but sure-handed, the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary, and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall fun. It combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. For all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films, sit through this one and it may change your attitude. <br /><br />
394 0 While being a great <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON> western, this film has gone down as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy all through it, and just downright untruths to boot! Continuity was cast to the four winds. Anybody catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes. Come on! Then there is <PERSON>Brian Keith</PERSON>'s ridiculous hat! Costumer must of been away or something. Or just out of their mind!
395 1 "Wisecracker," the biography of actor <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>, offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies. The old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films, but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> museum screening of SHOW PEOPLE, the late silent feature in which he co-starred with <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>. Beforehand, <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter, but he was pleasantly surprised (and no doubt relieved) at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it. Watch the film today and you can see why: SHOW PEOPLE is a delightful <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair, yet without malice. It's still funny and its satirical points still resonate. Needless to say, the technology of movie-making has changed vastly since the silent days, but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE also stands as the best surviving work of <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>, a first-rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes. Where her career was concerned <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour, the newspaper magnate <PERSON>William Randolph Hearst</PERSON>. It's well known that <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> exerted enormous influence over <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' choice of roles, and well known too that, despite her gift for comedy, he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas. By the late '20s, for whatever reason, <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including THE RED MILL and THE PATSY), but SHOW PEOPLE, directed by the great <PERSON>King Vidor</PERSON>, stands as her most enjoyable showcase. <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON> gives an engaging, likable performance as her boyfriend and co-star <PERSON>Billy Boone</PERSON>, but this is the leading lady's show all the way.<br /><br /><PERSON>Marion</PERSON> plays Southern belle <PERSON>Peggy Pepper</PERSON>, an aspiring actress who storms <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star. (Her dad Colonel Pepper is played by actor/director <PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON>, a veteran of <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON>'s Biograph dramas whoÂ—coincidentally?Â—resembled <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION>!) One of <PERSON>Marion</PERSON>'s funniest bits, often excerpted elsewhere, is her audition at the Comet Studio casting office. While Dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray ("Sorrow! . . . Joy!") and drops a handkerchief across her face, <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON> assumes the appropriate expression and posture. She's hired, only to discover that <ORGANIZATION>Comet</ORGANIZATION> makes low-brow comedies, the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue. Of course, Comet is intended as a take-off of <PERSON>Mack Sennett</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION>, but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds. As Peggy Pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves Comet for the more prestigious High Art Studio, assuming the name "<PERSON>Patricia Peppoire</PERSON>" as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress. At some point it may occur to us (as it surely did to viewers in 1928) that <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' rival <PERSON>Gloria Swanson</PERSON> started out in <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION> comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON>. And as Miss <PERSON>Peppoire</PERSON> takes herself more and more seriously, giving the high-hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic <PERSON>Billy Boone</PERSON>, <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON> herself. This is especially notable during an interview sequence, when Miss <PERSON>Peppoire</PERSON>'s spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot-on impersonation of <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON>. I suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof, but I have to wonder how friendly relations were between <LOCATION>Gloria</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> after this movie was released.<br /><br />In any event, SHOW PEOPLE is a delicious treat for buffs, who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout. <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON> contributes a nice bit, sans makeup and looking quite distinguished, eagerly seeking <PERSON>Patricia Peppoire</PERSON>'s autograph! (And in a show of good sportsmanship <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> herself puts in a self-mocking cameo appearance, evening the score for poking fun at <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON> by poking fun at herself.) This is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate, at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business. SHOW PEOPLE surely belongs in the company of such classics as SUNSET BOULEVARD and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, among <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s most expertly produced, enjoyable exercises in amused self-examination.
396 0 <PERSON>Burt Kennedy</PERSON> used to be a very good director, but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior "The Last Command" from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's WAY too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours, like this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION>, check out <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>'s 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy. Skip it.
397 1 Oh it's so cool to watch a Silent Classic once in while! Director <PERSON>Vidor</PERSON> is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself. The story is about having success in life and the way it changes you. <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio. She becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (poor) past! The cameos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the main character (<PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>) sees...<PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special... It's got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then. A must-see if you ask me!!
398 0 This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from <PERSON>Clancy Brown</PERSON> who is criminally underused here, and <PERSON>Michael Pollard</PERSON>. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.
399 1 I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classics (such as <PERSON>Nosferatu</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Metropolis</LOCATION>, The General and <ORGANIZATION>Wings</ORGANIZATION>) but among them, my favorite is this film (it may not be the best--but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked it up on IMDb, I noticed I immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made. <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not JUST <PERSON>William Randolph Hearst</PERSON>'s mistress.<br /><br />The story involves a hick from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> coming to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> with every expectation that she would be an instant star! Her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see!
400 0 That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. <PERSON>Michael Bowen</PERSON> spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the "This Network" airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.
401 1 Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> plays a hick from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> who crashes <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> with help from <PERSON>Haines</PERSON>, a bit player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star.<br /><br />A great lampoon on <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and its pretensions. <ORGANIZATION>Davies & Haines</ORGANIZATION> are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Douglas Fairbanks</PERSON>, <PERSON>William S. Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Gilbert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elinor Glyn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Norma Talmadge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mae Murray</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rod LaRocque</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leatrice Joy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dorothy Sebastian</PERSON>, <PERSON>Estelle Taylor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Louella Parsons</PERSON>, <PERSON>Renee Adoree</PERSON>, <PERSON>Aileen Pringle</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> (you have to see it) are a hoot. A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON>! <PERSON>Dell Henderson</PERSON> plays the father. <PERSON>Polly Moran</PERSON> is a maid. <PERSON>Paul Ralli</PERSON> is the slimy leading man.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of <PERSON>Gloria Swanson</PERSON> as its model (I think <PERSON>Mae Murray</PERSON> is closer). <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> and <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON> were friends. But this film's story does parallel the rise of <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON> from one-reel <PERSON>Mack Sennett</PERSON> comedies with <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON> to STAR in <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON> films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br /><PERSON>Davies</PERSON> and <PERSON>Haines</PERSON> were huge MGM stars and friends. Odd that <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> never teamed them up in a talkie. They're great together! A sweet romance and delightful spoof of early <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bebe Daniels</PERSON> are mentioned but do not appear.
402 0 <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director <PERSON>Carlos Saura</PERSON> knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.
403 1 The great and underrated <PERSON>Marion Davies</PERSON> shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful <PERSON>William Haines</PERSON>. <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> plays a hick from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> who crashes <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> with help from <PERSON>Haines</PERSON>.

404 0 That's not the sound of bees, that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I'll never know. The plot is simple...3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought <PERSON>Rohmer</PERSON> was deadly. This is even worse, if that's possible. > I must really be a masochist if I could watch this entire movie without turning it off...or killing someone.
405 1 A Give this Movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time-Walter <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> & <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> collaborate with <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> and all of the other actors that are in this film + director <PERSON>Herbert Ross</PERSON>, and all of that makes this stage adaption come true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70's. I love the type of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh so hard.<br /><br />I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper-only $3). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to watch it again because I kept missing a few parts the first time. The second time I watched it, it felt a lot better, and I laughed a lot harder. I'm definitely going to re-get this on DVD because I HAVE to see the special features.<br /><br />It's very funny how that happens. Two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers. They get along well on stage, but really argue off stage, they can't survive another minute with each other, then some 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a TV special. You can find that in this film. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> & <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> were terrific in this film. It's a damn shame they died. <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> deserved that <PERSON>Oscar</PERSON>. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age. <PERSON>Jessica Tandy</PERSON> breaks the record as the oldest actress. <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON> was also fantastic in this. He won a <ORGANIZATION>Golden Globe</ORGANIZATION> for best supporting actor. He deserved that <ORGANIZATION>Golden Globe</ORGANIZATION>. Although many people might disagree with what I am about to say, everybody in this film gave a strong performance. This Comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: Whoever hates this film is a "Putz"
406 0 Well, as <PERSON>Goethe</PERSON> once said, there really isn't any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on "something that has had a great effect". "La Maman et La Putain" has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film, certainly, should be dissuaded from watching it. To express a purely subjective judgement, however, I feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people: "Don't watch it; it's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry." And by that I don't mean "sick and angry" about "the human condition" or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film - "an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty" and so on - and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be. My beef with the film is rather that I don't see this hours-long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any GENERALLY relevant message at all. All three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals: <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> to the greatest degree, of course, because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds; <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> perhaps to the least degree, because we see the least of her. <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>'s affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value, of course, but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that <PERSON>Jean-Pierre LÃ</PERSON>©aud is most likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like "un homme beau comme un film de <PERSON>Nicholas Ray</PERSON>", he really was just reproducing word-for-word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film. I suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100% of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu. What made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> and <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us. If a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping (mostly in this very flat) with another, and running around <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> proposing marriage to yet a third, well, I suppose I can wish him the best of luck in the dog-eat-dog world he's chosen to create for himself. What I can't, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his "anxiety" and his "despair". The same goes double for the even more despicable <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON>, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty. As I say, if "La Maman et La Putain" is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then I suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being "unflinching" (though why one should even feel like "flinching" once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe I can't imagine). The problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced - and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics - that <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>, <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities. This latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense. There may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular. But the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work. It surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone, or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> are going to end up disappointed and bitter. Watch "La Maman et La Putain" if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post-'68 Parisian milieu which was probably, unfortunately, not restricted to just a few particularly anti-social types like these. But please don't make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by <PERSON>Jean Renoir</PERSON> or <PERSON>Martin Scorsese</PERSON> might be argued to have.
407 1 The <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s Sunshine Boys starring <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness, but the laughter always bitter taste. Seeing <PERSON>Willy Clark</PERSON>(<PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Al Lewis</PERSON>(<PERSON>Burns</PERSON>) two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue. <PERSON>Willy</PERSON> not ever surrender and continue to look work, while <PERSON>Al</PERSON> is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter. The couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony, but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel, and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between. Now if they would work, they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story TV show. The meets is explosive and liberating for the old questionsÂ…. The <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple <PERSON>Walter Matthu</PERSON>(Nomination Academy Award as Best Actor) and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>(Won the Academy Award as Best Support Actor). The two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them. The movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report Love-Heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life. My rate is 7.
408 0 The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by <PERSON>Mary Ellen Trainor</PERSON>, once the wife to director <PERSON>Robert Zemeckis</PERSON>, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> suit(played by a deviously hideous <PERSON>Larry Drake</PERSON>). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old "<LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> kills" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. It's essentially <PERSON>Trainor</PERSON> trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show's highlights.
409 1 First off, I dislike almost all <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> movies. But there is something about this that is unique, that draws me in, and I would say it is among the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> meet my grandmothers? <br /><br />Ah, afraid they might sue, so he changed them into men. And how dull would it be if they were only housewives, show biz stars is more fun. Well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>'s magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters.<br /><br />Secondly, I have little tolerance for <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>, but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances I can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character).<br /><br />Very ethnic in flavor, and over the top, you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off. For me, the pleasure lingers.
410 0 I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment. <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the <ORGANIZATION>Dream Time</ORGANIZATION>).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. That's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didn't seem so awful in this movie. Actually I didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of <PERSON>Weir</PERSON>'s potential, was in <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>'s apartment where <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> has gone to confront the old man for scaring <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s wife. <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> keeps asking him "Who are you?" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.
411 1 First, an explanation: Despite my headline, I'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is NOT one of the best films ever made. All the criticisms registered here have valid points. Also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter. He does have a distinctively <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ear for dialogue -- especially dry, Jewish, love-suffused sarcasm -- and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love, then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie.<br /><br />So much for warnings. Here's my main point: <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> is flat-out perfect, even beyond perfect, in this movie. I have never seen him funnier, or more touching for that matter -- because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his Big Star self-image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline, he also shows us the more vulnerable, maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch. And he only barely shows us that sad part -- it's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father's or husband's mental decline right now (I mention this as a warning), but artistically, it's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots I'm seen in possibly any film performance. This is beyond Method acting -- <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery. This is a masterpiece of comic acting.<br /><br />About <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>: I personally find his acting annoying in general, and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here. ("Chicken is funny...." is one of them.) So if you like him, you should like him here, and if you don't this movie won't change your mind.<br /><br />About the 1976 Oscars...I agree that <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> was unfortunate to be up against <PERSON>Nicholson</PERSON> in "Cuckoo's Nest" that year. It was a killer year for leading-actor competition; if only there were separate Oscars for comedy and drama, then I think the Best Actor Oscars would have gone to <PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON> for "Dog Day Afternoon" and to <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> for "The Sunshine Boys" -- not to dis <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s fine work as <PERSON>McMurphy</PERSON>, but I think that <PERSON>Pacino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> were each CLEARLY more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than <PERSON>Nicholson</PERSON> was that year. Also, I believe that <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> got the Supporting Actor Oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance -- I mean, he was good in this movie, but not THAT good. (<PERSON>Burns</PERSON>'s fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return to show biz beat <PERSON>Brad Dourif</PERSON>'s truly brilliant debut in "Cuckoo's Nest," not to mention <PERSON>Chris Sarandon</PERSON>'s stunning debut in "Dog Day Afternoon" -- which I think proves my theory.) <br /><br />Oscar theories aside, here's my bottom line review: If you like <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s comic acting, then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures, fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides. (But if you're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip, then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now.)
412 0 I gave this film 2 stars only because <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the "actor" was that played <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.
413 1 I'm 14, so you probably would think I have never heard of <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> or <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> or anyone like that. Boy are you wrong. I had heard that <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> was in this movie and that he won an Academy Award for it. I have been a fan of <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and loved it. This one was also very awesome. <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> did a great job. So did <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>(this is the first time I've ever seen him perform). And even though they had really small roles, <PERSON>Phyllis Diller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steve Allen</PERSON> did a good job. That special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done. Let me say this, if you are a fan of <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> or <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>, you should see this movie right away!
414 0 This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />Unless you are a major <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone appears to like them in this movie. There is not a plot to be found in this flick. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.
415 1 At first this looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny film. Basically forgetful ex-comedians <PERSON>Willy Clark</PERSON> (Golden Globe winner, and <PERSON>Oscar</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>BAFTA</ORGANIZATION> nominated <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Al Lewis</PERSON> (<PERSON>Oscar</PERSON> winning, and <PERSON>Golden Glove</PERSON> nominated <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show. <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON>Ben Clark</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Golden Globe</ORGANIZATION> winning <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other, how wrong he is. They cannot get on all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually. Also starring <PERSON>Lee Meredith</PERSON> as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), <PERSON>Carol DeLuise</PERSON> as Mrs. <PERSON>Doris Green</PERSON>, <PERSON>Al</PERSON>'s Daughter, <ORGANIZATION>Rosetta LeNoire</ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION>Odessa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s nurse and Muppets from Space's <PERSON>F. Murray Abraham</PERSON> as Mechanic. I think the best line of the film is <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> mentioning that <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> called him "a son of a bitch bastard". It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!
416 0 Horrible film with bits of the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring <PERSON>Guitar Wolf</PERSON> if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.
417 1 The Sunshine Boys is a terrific comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a TV special despite the fact that they despise each other.<br /><br />The comic genius of two masters at work, <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things! The material is fast-paced and witty, appealing to all ages.<br /><br />MILD SPOILER ALERT: There are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft, sincere, tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success, are each other.<br /><br />If anyone loves The Odd Couple, you'll adore this movie. An excellent film!
418 0 I could never stand watching Happy Days after <PERSON>Chachi</PERSON> joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> (a skateboard chase scene!). <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> in her first "grown-up" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
419 1 <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> just work so well together. The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection. <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization. <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable. Watch for the scene near the end when <PERSON>Al</PERSON> and his daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker, and <PERSON>Al</PERSON>'s reaction - priceless.
420 0 Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, <ORGANIZATION>Public Enemy</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ultramagnetic Mc</PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION>Jungle Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bizmarkie</PERSON> to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.
421 1 Two great comedians in a great <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> movie based on his hit play.<br /><br />Great combination, especially when the comedians in question are <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>. Small wonder why <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> won an Oscar for this; he's as sharp and as funny as ever. And <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> is every bit his match, if a tad more crotchety.<br /><br />This is familiar <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years.<br /><br />It's a delight to watch these two pick at each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. Myself, I especially enjoyed the "knock, knock, knock / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a fan of either <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> or <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>, you'll enjoy it, too.<br /><br />In fact, you'll enjoy the whole movie. <br /><br />Ten stars. Put a little "Sunshine" in your life.
422 0 Hilariously obvious "drama" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy--or something. To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was <PERSON>Ramon</PERSON>. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with. Also these "great" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun.<br /><br />I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love hip hop here's your movie. But it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it. Also HOW did this get a PG rating? There's an incredible amount of swearing in this.
423 1 As a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age, this film is without parallel. It is, quite simply, brilliant. Full marks to everyone - from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product. You can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers.
424 0 Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance", <PERSON>Stan Lathan</PERSON>'s "Beat Street" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br /><PERSON>Lathan</PERSON> is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift ""Beat Street" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
425 1 Much like the comedy duo of its title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic 30-odd years later. It's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s. This makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film, perhaps the best <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> ever wrote.<br /><br /><PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Willy Clark</PERSON>, once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who can't get a job in a potato chip commercial. His nephew and agent <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> (<PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>) is sure he can get work if <PERSON>Willy</PERSON> will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner <PERSON>Al Lewis</PERSON> (<PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>) for an <ORGANIZATION>ABC-TV</ORGANIZATION> celebration of show business nostalgia.<br /><br />Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" has going for it in spades, right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of <PERSON>Cole Porter</PERSON>'s "Be A Clown". Then there's the film's present-day setting in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound. The periods collide in <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s glorious mess of a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> apartment, where framed photos and cartoons of long-dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty <PERSON>Zabar</PERSON> grocery bags. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you might even feel like you were in that apartment.<br /><br /><PERSON>Willy</PERSON> clearly has been living there too long. He's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils. <PERSON>Willy</PERSON> wakes up and picks up the phone.<br /><br />"Hello, who is this?" A pause. "Never mind, it's the tea."<br /><br />Old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else's hands, but <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>'s deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs your noses in <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s almost existential condition without turning you off at all. "89 years old and just like that, he dies of nothing'" <PERSON>Willy</PERSON> says of one old songwriting friend, before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed "lady" with "baby".<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON> won an Oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>, but it's <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> who brings this one home, his make-up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this. <PERSON>Willy</PERSON> is obnoxious in the extreme, fully deserving <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>'s description "crazy freakin' old man", but you root for him throughout, enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience. His lines kill you, too, especially when he's trying to kill <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>, for whom the TV reunion turns out to be a bad idea.<br /><br />"You're out of touch!" <PERSON>Willy</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> at one point. "I'm still in demand. I'm still hot!"<br /><br />"If this room was on fire you wouldn't be hot," <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> replies.<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Herbert Ross</PERSON> shoots everything in a very casual and understated way, with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance. You never get the feeling you are watching a movie, one of "The Sunshine Boys" many charms, and <PERSON>Ross</PERSON>'s direction, like the acting of the three principals, goes a long way toward achieving that end.<br /><br />Comedy is hard, especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by, but "<ORGANIZATION>The Sunshine Boys</ORGANIZATION>" makes it all seem a pleasure, because, for us watching, it is.
426 0 Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.
427 1 <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> were a famous vaudeville comedy act, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, who haven't spoken in over 10 years. <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> retired and <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> took it personally and has held a grudge ever since. Such is the premise of this hilarious <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> play made into a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON> shines as <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s nephew and agent. There's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor <PERSON>Fritz Feld</PERSON> starts it all off with a "pop." <PERSON>Rosetta LaNoire</PERSON>, who started out in the 30s in theater with <LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION> and later was Grandma on "Family Matters," is great in a small role.<br /><br />The only problem I had with it (and maybe I'm being too picky and/or serious) is the way <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> treats <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> when they first meet. Granted, he's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context. Also, I'm used to seeing <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> act that way in other movies, but not to <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>. And, <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s bellowing tends to get a little old. <br /><br />All in all, if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles, put in "The Sunshine Boys." They'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life.<br /><br /><PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>: "You have to slide it." <br /><br /><PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>: "Wait, wait. I think you have to slide it."
428 0 Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers "sensually" caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said...but please watch the movie yourselves...I am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives...like I did :(
429 1 An old vaudeville team of <PERSON>Willy Clark</PERSON> (<PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Al Lewis</PERSON> (<PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>) were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other. Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special...but find out they STILL hate each other. <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s nephew/agent (<PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>) tries to get them to work together.<br /><br />A big hit in its day and it won <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) liked it. It was written by <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> so its non-stop one-liners. Some of it was funny but making jokes of Willy and <PERSON>Al</PERSON>'s senility was NOT. Also I never liked <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly. All that aside this was fun. <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> was good matching him. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie. Also <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> is very good as <PERSON>Willy</PERSON>'s nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth seeing for <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> alone. This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had ANOTHER hit with "Oh God". So, this is good. Just good--not great. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s character really makes this hard to love. I give it a 7.
430 0 I am not so much like Love Sick as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of <PERSON>Alex</PERSON>, kik, <PERSON>Sandu</PERSON> their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.Ending up was sad.<br /><br />The director <PERSON>Tudor Giurgiu</PERSON> was in <ORGANIZATION>AMC</ORGANIZATION> theatre on Sunday 12:00PM on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.<br /><br />On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON> and her brother <PERSON>Sandu</PERSON> were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> moved into the building which <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON> was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Kik</ORGANIZATION>'s sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting forÂ…Â…. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The "ear piercing " part was kind of interesting. <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love. Also, the scene of they were lying in the soccer field, the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate.
431 1 The word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays, but this movie well deserves the appelation. The combination of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> (possibly the world's best living comic actor), and the late lamented <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> make for a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented <PERSON>Jack Benny</PERSON> from playing <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>' part, as had been planned. As it is, the reunion scene in <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter. Definitely one of my desert island films.<br /><br />"Enter!!!!!!!!!"

433 1 question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers <PERSON>Walther Mathau</PERSON> in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: quietly, deadpan, and with perfect timing as <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> does here.<br /><br />I know nothing of Vaudeville but this remains a favourite film, the two leads are hilarious, the script funny, the direction and pacing very fine. <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON> is very funny as straight man - trying to get at <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> through the window etc. Even the small parts are great.<br /><br />There are so many funny scenes, <PERSON>Mathau</PERSON> messing up the commercial, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> repeating his answers as if senile...<br /><br />A delight.<br /><br />Enterrrrrr!
434 0 This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (<ORGANIZATION>Tudor Chirila</ORGANIZATION>) - they can't act!
435 1 THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s play about a retired vaudevillian team, played by <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>, who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other. <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON> appears as <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment...vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s better screenplays and outstanding work by <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>. <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this, but I think <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as <PERSON>Willy Clark</PERSON>. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> was nominated for Best Actor but didn't stand a chance against <PERSON>Nicholson</PERSON> for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; however, in another year, this was an Oscar-worthy performance. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of the product right is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>.
436 0 ***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably. <PERSON>Maria</PERSON>'s acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera. Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br /><PERSON>Ioana</PERSON> seems even more tense than <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning. Just like her partner <PERSON>Maria</PERSON>, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps <PERSON>Maria</PERSON>'s character <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Tudor</PERSON> is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent. He has his character's attitude and it fits him. Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, <PERSON>Tudor Chirila</PERSON> is OK there, the landlady actually acts and <PERSON>Puya</PERSON> delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie. Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, <PERSON>Maria</PERSON>'s spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ioana</PERSON>. I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.
437 1 Taking over roles that <PERSON>Jack Albertson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sam Levene</PERSON> played on <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> play a couple of old time vaudeville comics, a team in the tradition of <PERSON>Joe Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Dale</PERSON> who seem to have a differing outlook on life.<br /><br /><PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON> is finding less and less work for him. <br /><br />What hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> can't comprehend it and take <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>'s decision personally.<br /><br /><PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> hits on a brain storm, reunite the guys and do it on a national television special. What happens here is pretty hilarious.<br /><br />The Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bittersweet story as well about old age. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> is on screen for most of the film, but it's <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> who got the kudos in the form of an Oscar at the ripe old age of 79.<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON> brought a bit of the personal into this film as well. As we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of <ORGANIZATION>Burns&Allen</ORGANIZATION> who the <ORGANIZATION>Monty Python troop</ORGANIZATION> borrowed a lot from. In 1958 due to health reasons, <PERSON>Gracie Allen</PERSON> retired and <PERSON>George</PERSON> kept going right up to the age of 100. Or at least pretty close to as an active performer.<br /><br />The <ORGANIZATION>Sunshine Boys</ORGANIZATION> is based on the team of <ORGANIZATION>Smith&Dale</ORGANIZATION> however and if you like The Sunshine Boys I strongly recommend you see Two Tickets to <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the American public at the turn of the last century. The doctor sketch that <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> do is directly from their material.<br /><br />And I do think you will like The <ORGANIZATION>Sunshine Boys</ORGANIZATION>.
438 0 it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence? i don't think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe. The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well - known people in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela <PERSON>Radulescu</PERSON>).SO to summarize it: "girl band tatty"+desperate/publicity needing "actors"+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= Love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...
439 1 <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>'s carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>. You can literally hear the script crackle. There are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less-quality actors involved. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> seems to had been born to play <PERSON>Willie Clark</PERSON> (of course, <PERSON>Oscar</PERSON> moreso in the Odd Couple), and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> crams into the character (the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> lives in the country that <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> is "out of touch" is the quintessential example of this) make this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any role, be it comedic or drama or whatever else. Period. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> work excellently together; the contrast they portray accentuates <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>'s superb knack at creating comedic conflict. This movie is simply one of the ultimate "must-sees" and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history.
440 0 "The Crush" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit "Sex and the City". <br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and <PERSON>Kenny Doughty</PERSON> is worth seeing more of). <br /><br />They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of "Sabrina" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.<br /><br />Surrounding <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION> as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued <PERSON>Anna Chancellor</PERSON>. <br /><br />The plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what might really be wrong. Just as with "Sex and the City," the writer/director is male, here first-timer <PERSON>Scot John McKay</PERSON>, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was "The Sad F*cker's Club" which would have made its parallels with the gay "<ORGANIZATION>Broken Hearts Club</ORGANIZATION>" even more obvious.<br /><br />(originally written 4/6/2002)
441 1 <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays. <PERSON>Felix Unger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Oscar Madison</PERSON> were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original, the former being picky and neat, the latter being slovenly and loose. <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> would rewrite (less successfully) the play in the 1990s as THE NEW ODD COUPLE, with female roommates. He made it a mixed couple (a woman with her daughter, and a man) in THE GOODBYE GIRLS. He also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with THE SUNSHINE BOYS, a <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> hit starring <PERSON>Jack Alberson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sam Levine</PERSON> as <PERSON>Al Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Willie Clark</PERSON>, the aged, semi-retired Vaudevillians. Here the "apartment" problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can't stand each other. The 1976 film starred <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> as <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>, and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> as Al.<br /><br />In actuality, <PERSON>Al</PERSON> probably does not think totally badly of Willie - <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> is pathological on the subject of Al. First Al had little habits, such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter "t", and slightly jabbing <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> with his index finger, on stage. Secondly, <PERSON>Al</PERSON> retired when his wife died. <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> was not ready to retire (and has been forcing his nephew and agent, <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> (<PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>) to try to get him jobs in commercials. But <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> can't remember lines unless they are funny, and keeps flubbing them. So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial.<br /><br /><PERSON>Ben</PERSON> is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy. He does bring <PERSON>Al</PERSON> to see <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>, and the sparks begin flying, as neither can figure out what the other is doing (and this is just in rehearsal. On top of that, <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> is insisting on changes (minor ones, but they throw off Al) such as saying "ENTER!!!" when <PERSON>Al</PERSON> knocks on the door. The initial rehearsal is a failure, but <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> manages to get them to the taping of the show. The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring <PERSON>Al</PERSON>'s neck?<br /><br />The three leads, <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>, do very well with the one-liners, frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter (example: "Chest pains...I'm getting chest pains <PERSON>Uncle Willie</PERSON>. Every Thursday I come here and get chest pains!" "So, come on Fridays!"). <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle, although <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s rough outer shell makes it difficult (he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville). <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> has a little better grasp on reality (at first) than <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly. <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> is not senile - he takes things slowly. But he seems far happier in accepting his retirement.<br /><br />I call this a final "Voyage of Discovery" for our modern <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. <PERSON>Al</PERSON> and <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> transcend their old skits, as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought. Even the irascible <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> admits that <PERSON>Al</PERSON> may be (to him) a pain in the ass, but he was a funny man.<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON> was not the original choice for the part of "Al Lewis" (supposedly <PERSON>Dale</PERSON> of the team <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and Dale). <PERSON>Jack Benny</PERSON> was. <PERSON>Benny</PERSON> probably would have done a good job, but ill-health forced him out (he died in 1975). <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> (whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator) turned in such a fine performance that he got the "Oscar" for best supporting actor, and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD!; OH GOD, YOU DEVIL; and GOING IN STYLE. He died in 1996 age 100, having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife <PERSON>Gracie Allan</PERSON>.
442 0 I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br /><PERSON>Anna Chancellor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Imelda Staunton</PERSON> could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette! Right.<br /><br />Like I said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.
443 1 I remember originally seeing this film at <ORGANIZATION>Radio City Music Hall</ORGANIZATION> when it came out. I didn't really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />With all due respect to <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> (RIP), <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> really deserved the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, <PERSON>Willie Clark</PERSON>. His mannerisms are first-rate. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh*t!" and when speaking to the Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: "No! No! No enchilada!!") Absolutely hilarious!<br /><br />Kudos to <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>, who played straight man to <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>.<br /><br />I just wish this was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a bit old.<br /><br />I had no interest in seeing the remake with <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>, because in no way can it match the original.
444 0 As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a "chick flick", and it failed miserably. <PERSON>Andy McDowell</PERSON> isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent "plot" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.
445 1 A hilarious <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON> comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end. The late <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late Oscar-winner <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON>) for a final reunion show on stage.<br /><br /><PERSON>Benjamin Martin</PERSON> is <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s agent and nephew, and the two have just as much chemistry as <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>. I love <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>'s grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is, and yet also very different.<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, as the absent-minded old man, is just as funny as <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>: Want some crackers? I've got coconut, pineapple and graham.<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON>: How about a plain cracker?<br /><br /><PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>: I don't got plain. I got coconut, pineapple and graham.<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON>: Okay<br /><br /><PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>: They're in the cupboard in the kitchen.<br /><br /><PERSON>Burns</PERSON>: Maybe later.<br /><br />Or how about this:<br /><br /><PERSON>Matthau</PERSON>: When I did black, the whites knew what I was saying!<br /><br />You've got to see it in the movie to understand it!<br /><br />All in all, a refreshingly hilarious, sweet, heartfelt, warm, belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /><br />They just don't make them like this anymore! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude, juvenile and stupid, this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters, smart and funny dialogue, and grand entertainment.<br /><br />One of the best buddy comedies of all time, right up there with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "Lethal Weapon," and "The Hard Way."<br /><br />You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time!<br /><br />4.5/5 stars.<br /><br />- <PERSON>John Ulmer</PERSON>
446 0 Not a `woman film' but film for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman. Director <PERSON>Andy McKay</PERSON> simply doesn't know woman. Peaks of bad taste, American Pie's humor style, crude story, no sense, groundless story, refuted characters. Vulgar fantasies came to life on screen. Insulting and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it.
447 1 in one of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s best plays. Creaky, cranky ex-Vaudeville stars played by <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Burns</PERSON> are teaming up for a TV comedy special. The problem is they haven't even SEEN each other in over a decade. Full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies along with a steady stream of humor. Good work also by <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON> as the harried nephew, <ORGANIZATION>Rosetta LeNoire</ORGANIZATION> as the nurse, and <PERSON>Howard Hesseman</PERSON> as the TV commercial director. <PERSON>Steve Allen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Phyllis Diller</PERSON> appear as themselves. Trivia note: The opening montage contains footage from <LOCATION>Hollywood Revue</LOCATION> of 1929 and shows <PERSON>Marie Dressler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bessie Love</PERSON>, <PERSON>Polly Moran</PERSON>, Cliff Edwards, <PERSON>Charles King</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gus Edwards</PERSON>, and the singing <PERSON>Brox</PERSON> Sisters.
448 0 The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.<br /><br />No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.<br /><br />I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.<br /><br />The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.<br /><br />
449 1 The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite feel good movies. I first saw it when it as the Christmas attraction at <ORGANIZATION>Radio City Music Hall</ORGANIZATION> when it first came out and loved it ever since. I ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters, and if it was playing today I'd go out to see it again.<br /><br />Now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads. <PERSON>Matthau</PERSON> was brilliant, but had the misfortune of being nominated against <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>'s Oscar winning performance of <PERSON>Randall P. MacMurphy</PERSON> in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> did win, though <PERSON>Richard Benjiman</PERSON> deserved at least to be nominated as well. Even the smallest roles were played to perfection, like <PERSON>Fritz Feld</PERSON> auditioning for the potato chips commercial. <br /><br />Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of the greatly underrated <PERSON>Herbert Ross</PERSON>. <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> who previously brought a two person play, "The Owl And The Pussycat" to the screen and made a full movie out of it, does it again. He opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play. He fleashens out the story and the characters.<br /><br />Here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where <PERSON>Ben Clark</PERSON> comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special. Though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago I did see at the broadway revival of the play with <PERSON>Jack Klugman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tony Randall</PERSON>, which was wonderful. But I think that <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> and screenwriter, playwright <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> improved on it. It's just a wonderful film.
450 0 SPOILER: The young lover, <PERSON>Jed</PERSON>, is kicked out by the spinster, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> (<PERSON>Andie McDowell</PERSON>), because she wrongly believes that <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends. <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> thought she caught them en flagrante delicto. <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> throws <PERSON>Jed</PERSON>'s shoes out the door. <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. Then he gets run over ("Crushed", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. And dies.<br /><br />"And then he gets run over by a truck." Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? Up to then, its a comedy that intends to be frothy, but lacks any real fizz. Everybody but <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> is just annoying. And then they kill <PERSON>Jed</PERSON>, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give it 2 ugh's.
451 1 This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring <PERSON>Bebe Daniels</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ruby Keeler</PERSON>. When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd Street, especially the character <PERSON>Eloise</PERSON> who's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle, like <PERSON>Bebe Daniels</PERSON> did in 42nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star. This film, like most race films, keeps people watching because of the great entertainment. Race films always showed Black Entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era. The Dancing Styles, The Music, Dressing Styles, You'll Love It. This movie could of been big if it was made in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, it would of had better scenery, better filming, and more money which would make any movie better. But its worth watching because it is good and <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON> does good with the little he has. I have to say out of all <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON>'s films, Swing is the best! The movie features singers, dancers, actresses, and actors who were popular but forgotten today. <PERSON>Doli Armena</PERSON>, a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> is blowing a horn in the sky. The sexy, hot female dancer <PERSON>Consuela Harris</PERSON> would put <PERSON>Ann Miller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gyspy Rose Lee</PERSON> to shame.<br /><br />Adding further info... Popular blues singer of the 20's and 30's <LOCATION>Cora Green</LOCATION> is the focus of the film, she's <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON>, a good, hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women. A nosy neighbor played by <PERSON>Amanda Randolph</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> what she seen and heard and <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive, curvy woman by the name of <PERSON>Eloise</PERSON> (played <PERSON>Hazel Diaz</PERSON>, a Hot-Cha entertainer in the 30's) and a fight breaks out. Then <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> goes to <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> played by one of the most beautiful women in movies <PERSON>Dorothy Van Engle</PERSON>. <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> provides <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> with a home, a job, and helps her become a star when temperamental <PERSON>Cora Smith</PERSON> (played by <PERSON>Hazel</PERSON>, I guess she's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior. When <PERSON>Cora</PERSON> gets drunk and breaks her leg, <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> convinces everyone that <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> is right for the job and <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> is right and a star is born in <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON>. Tall, long, lanky, but handsome <PERSON>Carman Newsome</PERSON> is the cool aspiring producer who <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> looks out for as well. Pretty boy <PERSON>Larry Seymour</PERSON> plays the no good man but after <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> threatens him, he might shape up. There are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where <PERSON>Cora Smith</PERSON> (<PERSON>Hazel Diaz</PERSON>) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that's not enough, she almost gets into a fight with <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> again. In between there's great entertainment by chorus girls, tap dancers, shake dancers, swing music, and blues singing. There's even white people watching the entertainment, I wonder where <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON> found them, there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club, <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON> frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films, he should be commended for such a bold move.<br /><br />This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to <PERSON>Oscar Micheaux</PERSON>. This movie is one of the best of the race film genre, its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business.<br /><br />No these early race films may not be the best, can't be compared with Hallelujah, <ORGANIZATION>Green Pastures</ORGANIZATION>, Stormy Weather, Cabin In The Sky, <PERSON>Carmen Jones</PERSON>, or any other <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person's eyes. These films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life, be beautiful, classy, and elegant, and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. Most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren't the best, but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time, <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spencer Williams</PERSON> couldn't afford <PERSON>Nina Mae McKinney</PERSON>, <PERSON>Josephine Baker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ethel Waters</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Fredi Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Paul Robeson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rex Ingram</PERSON>, and more of the bigger stars, so <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON> and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies, some were good, some weren't great actors and actresses, but I think <PERSON>Micheaux</PERSON> and others knew most weren't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent, they just wanted their stories told, and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films. For some true actors/actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work, especially if they didn't want to play <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> stereotypes, so I think you'll be able to spot the true actors/actresses from the nightclub performers. These race films are very historic, they could have been lost forever, many are lost, maybe race films aren't the greatest example of cinema but even <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> films didn't start out great in the beginning. I think if the race film genre continued, it would have better. If your looking for great acting, most race films aren't the ones, but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films, than watch race films. There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast, Moon Over <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>, Body and Soul, Paradise In <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>, Keep Punching, Sunday Sinners, Dark <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, Broken Strings, Boy! What A Girl, Mystery In Swing, Miracle In <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>, and Sepia Cinderella, that not only has good entertainment but good acting.
452 0 <PERSON>Andie McDowell</PERSON> is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends.<br /><br />Seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man, the "girl-friends", dead-set on terminating this "silly relationship", go over and beyond the call of duty in "helping out" their friend (who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game".<br /><br />A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous. Far fetched no longer covers it. Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. Instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. There is much better material out there. This one isn't worth your time.
453 1 <br /><br />One of the best films I've ever seen. <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON>'s performance was excellent and outstanding. He did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life. His character was so convincing, it made me almost think I were in the theater watching it live, I give it 5 stars.
454 0 Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).
455 1 <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON> is a direct descendent of Confederate General <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>, according the IMDb.com movie database. After seeing this film, you may think <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON>'s appearance is reincarnation at it's best. One of my most favorite films. I wish the composer, <PERSON>Peter Rodgers Melnick</PERSON> had a CD or there was a soundtrack available. Wonderful scenery and music and "all too-true-to-life," especially for those of us that live in, or have moved to, the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>. This is a "real moment in time." Life moves on, slowly, but "strangers we do not remain."
456 0 I thought it was a New-York located movie: wrong! It's a little British countryside setting.<br /><br />I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling.<br /><br />What Do I have left? Maybe, a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. The tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and <PERSON>McDowell</PERSON> delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. In her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works.<br /><br />Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. The women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision.
457 1 "Convicts" is very much a third act sort of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day. And, by extension, the life of its main character, <PERSON>Soll</PERSON> (<PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON>).<br /><br />This is the first collaboration of director <PERSON>Peter Masterson</PERSON> and writer <PERSON>Horton Foote</PERSON>. Six years earlier, the worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful", a film that seems almost action-packed in comparison to this one. <PERSON>Masterson</PERSON> is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just barely this side of adequate. The slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer <PERSON>Toyomichi Kurita</PERSON>, who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth.<br /><br />Because this is essentially a filmed play, with little in the way of editing or directing prowess, it all comes to the acting. As far as I'm concerned there's no flaws here. <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are wholly real, uninterested in anything besides living. <PERSON>Lukas Haas</PERSON>, a young actor who I was familiar with from "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character very much like his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, slightly scared and sad, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural from him.<br /><br />Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is a disservice to this film. That title, along with the opening scene, seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture. If slow-paced stage productions don't interest you terribly, you'll want to pass on this one as well. Otherwise, this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often.<br /><br />Enjoy.
458 0 Caught this on <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were anything but? <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's SO devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the "good news"! By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? <PERSON>Janine</PERSON> should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about <PERSON>Molly</PERSON>, the better!<br /><br />As for the guilt <PERSON>Janine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Molly</PERSON> feel over Jed, please! It's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Where's the guilt over poor <PERSON>Gerald</PERSON>, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this "movie"!
459 1 In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer. Alas, this type of "character driven" film is far too rare these days. <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON>'s performance as well as <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> are faithful to their audience's high expectations. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a "close-up" personal quality to the narrative. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all Outstanding. The only thing that keeps it from being a cinema Masterpiece is the lack of a great Cinematographer, but pretty pictures are not everything. How can talent the likes of <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON> continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing?
460 0 This was awful. <ORGANIZATION>Andie Macdowell</ORGANIZATION> is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film that portrays <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> as full of Chocolate box cottages, and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe <ORGANIZATION>Hogwarts</ORGANIZATION> look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> would ever speak to <PERSON>Molly</PERSON> again after her terrible behaviour. A final note- what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention <PERSON>Anna Chancellor</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>Macdowell</ORGANIZATION> should stick to advertising wrinkle cream.
461 1 When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON>. The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from <PERSON>Soll</PERSON>, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. <PERSON>Soll</PERSON> is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> was back then. I suppose that if <PERSON>Soll</PERSON> lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>(<PERSON>Mel Winkler</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>(<PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>). The conversations between <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> and <PERSON>Soll</PERSON> are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mel Winkler</PERSON> both but in great performances as well as <PERSON>Hass</PERSON>.<br /><br />This movie should have gotten more notoriety. However it's on DVD and worth the money.<br /><br /><PERSON>Rayvyn</PERSON>
462 0 This starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with <PERSON>Andie</PERSON>'s character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. <PERSON>Andie</PERSON>'s character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
463 1 This is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions. It contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy. You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs. And, it ends very upbeat
464 0 This had to be one of the worst films ever. When <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> shows up and <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping...so <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. Another bad scene was when <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. <PERSON>Andie</PERSON>'s acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed <PERSON>Andie</PERSON>. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again <PERSON>Andie</PERSON>'s acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals.
465 1 What a delightful movie. The characters were not only lively but alive, mirroring real every day life and strife within a family. Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends.<br /><br />The story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama, the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops. The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reactions of the characters to conflict, opinion, and resolve.<br /><br />Not an epic, but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones. Plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
466 0 This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office.<br /><br />But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise.<br /><br /><PERSON>Andie MacDowell</PERSON> gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by <PERSON>Imelda Staunton</PERSON>, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms. <PERSON>Staunton</PERSON> seems unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the writer-director.<br /><br />If <PERSON>Notting Hill</PERSON> annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.
467 1 I actually found this movie 'interesting'; finally one worth my time to watch and rent. It is true... some scenes were over the top on emotionalism, shouting, etc., but what movie doesn't stress its agenda, genre or 'ax to grind'? Almost None! What surprised me is that I read a review elsewhere done by a S.Fran reviewer on another review site, but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his "own" review of the movie; not of the movie at all. Anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chases, Yea!! Being "in" an Italian family myself, I can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen. The movie has its tear jerking parts as well. It is what real life can be in such an environment. Nice movie.
468 0 This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said <PERSON>Andie McDowell</PERSON> was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment.
469 1 I've always knew <PERSON>Anne DeSalvo</PERSON> was a great character actor, now I know she is a great writer/director also. I have been a fan since I first saw her in the movies "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories".<br /><br />It's so rare to see <PERSON>Lee Grant</PERSON> these days in anything. She has been missing from the screen for far too long. It's also wonderful to see <PERSON>Cloris Leachman</PERSON> in something other than a sit-com. This is her best work since "the Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family you will love this movie. I wasn't expecting a lot when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get the chance, watch it.
470 0 The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be "caught up" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.
471 1 A wonderful movie! Anyone growing up in an Italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters. A good family movie with sadness, humor, and very good acting from all. You will enjoy this movie!! We need more like it.
472 0 I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of "A New Hope" and the thrilling sophistication of "The Empire Strikes Back," I remember awaiting "Return of the Jedi" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at <LOCATION>Jabba</LOCATION>'s lair, this "film" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br /><PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from "A New Hope" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: "I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich."<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that <PERSON>Harrison Ford</PERSON> managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.
473 1 It is a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "The Amati Girls" is such a movie. In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings. Was this story autobiographical for the writer/director? It has the aura of reality.<br /><br />The all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness. Who would not want <PERSON>Mercedes Ruehl</PERSON> as an older sister? I have loved her work since "For <PERSON>Roseanna</PERSON>".<br /><br />With most movies, one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was hard to suspend such belief in "The Amati Girls". One feels such a part of this family! How I wanted to come to the defense of <PERSON>Dolores</PERSON> when her family is stifling her emotional life. And wanted to cheer <PERSON>Lee Grant</PERSON> as she levels criticism at <PERSON>Cloris Leachman</PERSON>'s hair color. The humor throughout is not belly laugh humor, but instead has a feel-good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such.<br /><br />The love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished.<br /><br />It is no coincidence that the family name, <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION>, translated from the Italian means 'the loved ones'.
474 0 After being hugely entertained by Mr. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s performance as a cad in "The Tailor of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>" (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional impact, etc.), I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that "The Tailor of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part;" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7? Hardly.
475 1 Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many pleasant memories. this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies.
476 0 A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely you're movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something.. I just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!!
477 1 Can Scarcely Imagine a Better Movie Than This<br /><br />Hey, before you all go "Chick Flick" on me. I am a very Large Strong & Masculine, <PERSON>Macho Man</PERSON>, who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years. <br /><br />The acting was Superb and the Story was Marvelous. This is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul. The Acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast. <br /><br />I have known for a Good while that <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes Ruehl</ORGANIZATION>, along with <PERSON>Holly Hunter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dame Edith Evans</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sissy Spacek</PERSON>, <PERSON>Judi Dench</PERSON> is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film. And of course <PERSON>Cloris Leachman</PERSON> (also in this film) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years.. At any rate this was an Amazing cast. This film was like a book that you cannot lay down, and when you have reached the last page wish for more...still more. I cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the IMDb only rates a 3.9<br /><br />That rating here is utterly Amazing to me. Or perhaps not. Perhaps in fact I do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad. It makes me ever so sad that films like "American Beauty" "Leaving Las Vegas" "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an "R" rating...R that is for "Rubbish". Hey o.k., I realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences, but it is a sad commentary when this lovely, powerful...extraordinarily, Directed, Acted, and written film seems to be over looked. <br /><br />It obviously was at the Academy Awards as well....How Sad. And How predictable. My summation is that if you want to see a powerful, Happy, Sad, beautiful story? watch ......preferably own this film...
478 0 I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess <PERSON>Hum Aapke Hain Kaun</PERSON> was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In <PERSON>HAHK Anupam Kher</PERSON> was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that <PERSON>Mohnish Behl</PERSON> would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
479 1 I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn't have the best time mainly because I didn't know about <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> or his story.<br /><br />But since this is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character.<br /><br />I don't know if the manner the events are told are true, or if it everything is fictional. But the way <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. I don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />This is a solid Western-type movie for everybody's tastes. <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> is great as always and the sexy <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> charms the screen.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.
480 0 I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON>, this guy, <PERSON>Sooraj Badjatya</PERSON>, seems to have completely lost it. After success of <PERSON>Hum Aapke Hain Kaun</PERSON>, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that <PERSON>Badjatyas</PERSON> have left <PERSON>Johars</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chopras</PERSON> behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. <PERSON>Aloknath</PERSON> does clichÃ© in a role of Girl's father, <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, <PERSON>Amrita rao</PERSON> is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.
481 1 Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> (<PERSON>Julia Cook - Ned Kelly</PERSON>'s lover), <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> (Ned) and <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> (<PERSON>Joe Byrne</PERSON> - <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s right hand man), and unattractive (sorry <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON>) actors play the drunken and corrupt <ORGANIZATION>Victorian Police Force</ORGANIZATION>. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> (Ledger) and <PERSON>Julia Cook</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Watts</LOCATION>) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder," it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>, the underdog. Besides, don't all Aussies love an underdog?
482 0 In director <PERSON>Sooraj Barjatya</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Vivah,20-something Delhi</LOCATION> boy <PERSON>Shahid Kapur</PERSON> finds himself smitten by the demure, small-town girl his father has selected for him to marry. Drawn to her innocence and simplicity, <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> agrees to the marriage barely moments after he's met her at her home in <LOCATION>Madhupur</LOCATION>, and the young lady in question <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> seems equally floored by her charming suitor. The marriage is fixed for six months later, and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young, budding love, their geographical distance notwithstanding. But <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>, who's been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents' death, is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage. And then, it's up to <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally.Much in the same vein as <ORGANIZATION>Hum Aapke Hain Koun</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Hum Saath Saath Hain</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barjatya</PERSON>'s new film Vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise. But sadly, the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated, even more far-fetched than those regressive <PERSON>Ekta Kapoor</PERSON> soaps. And the problem is clear Â– you just can't relate to such squeaky-clean characters who don't have one bad bone in their bodies. There are many things that work in favour of and against Hindi films, and timing is one such important factor. Twenty-five years ago, perhaps the plot of Vivah may not have felt like such a stretch, but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp. Perhaps the film's only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish, you can make out right away that the filmmaker's intention is not to deceive. Judging both by <PERSON>Barjatya</PERSON>'s previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that <PERSON>Barjatya</PERSON> believes in a perfect world, he believes in his good-as-gold characters, he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps.But alas, he's unable to translate his vision to the screen. It's difficult to overlook how one-dimensional his protagonists are Â– <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>, both virtuous and virginal Â– I mean, think about it, the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film. <PERSON>Barjatya</PERSON> may think he's returning to his <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> <PERSON>Pyar Kiya</PERSON> roots with <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON>, but truth is that the reason we embraced <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bhagyashree</PERSON> in that film, or even <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Madhuri</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Hum Aapke Hain Koun</LOCATION> is because they had such fantastic chemistry. Because although they were created out of the same mould as <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Vivah</LOCATION>, those pairs had mischief and masti. <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> are just insipid and boring.For a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story, the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s-style tunes that only further slacken the film's deadening pace. But if I had to choose just one reason to explain why <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON> doesn't work for me, it's because I'm not sure I can relate to any of the characters who inhabit <PERSON>Barjatya</PERSON>'s story. To some perhaps, <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON> will give hope, that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere. But I'm a little cynical I guess. So, give me the coquettish <PERSON>Madhuri</PERSON> of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, give me the bratty <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> Pyar Kiya, I'll even take that mischievous <PERSON>Karisma Kapoor</PERSON> of <PERSON>Hum Saath Saath Hain</PERSON>. But save me from these dullards. You know, some marriages aren't made in heaven. This one's Vivah!
483 1 I'm tired of people judging films on their "historical accuracy". IT'S A MOVIE PEOPLE!! The writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story! There are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history....Braveheart, <PERSON>Wyatt Earp</PERSON>, Gangs of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Geronimo</PERSON>: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans....all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically. If you want to see a few great actors do what they do best, then I suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.
484 0 From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> can't find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better left lost. Ms. <PERSON>Bertinelli</PERSON>'s performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, <PERSON>William Russ</PERSON> as brother <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Cubitt</PERSON> as love interest <PERSON>Noah</PERSON>. <PERSON>Jennifer Pisana</PERSON> as <PERSON>Soccoro</PERSON>, the daughter of single dad <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. <PERSON>Michael J. Murray</PERSON>'s script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like "Miracle on 34th Street", <PERSON>Ernst Lubitsch</PERSON>'s delightful "The shop around the corner" and, of course the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There's <PERSON>Frank Capra</PERSON>'s classics "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet <PERSON>John Doe</PERSON>". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or " Home for the Holidays" with <PERSON>Holly Hunter</PERSON> and a great performance by <PERSON>Robert Downey Jr.</PERSON>? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "Finding John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
485 1 I thought that this film was very well made, <PERSON>Heath Leger</PERSON> was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. <LOCATION>Orlando Bloom</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> were also really good and believable. How true it is to what really happened I have no idea, but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do. Maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and I did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought? In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain which was another good historical film. All in all I would highly recommend this film and I am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas.
486 0 <PERSON>William Russ</PERSON> is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION>) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (<PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON>) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But <PERSON>William Russ</PERSON> wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a "D".
487 1 Definitely one of my favourite movies. The story is good, acting is great, all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever.<br /><br /><PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> is terrific as <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> ''Ned'' <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>. He is gripping as the legendary outlaw, and is supported well by <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Orlando Bloom</LOCATION>. All action sequences are on point<br /><br />The film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end. One of my favourite films from the late legend <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON>, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in. And makes no mistake here.<br /><br />An excellent film all round.
488 0 The silent one-panel cartoon <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> comes to <ORGANIZATION>Fleischer Studios</ORGANIZATION>, billed as "The world's funniest human" in this dull little cartoon. <PERSON>Betty</PERSON>, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.
489 1 I didn't know what to expect from '<PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>', but absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and gripping. It also felt very authentic, I felt that I had been transported back to the 1800's. I've never been much of a <LOCATION>Heath Ledger</LOCATION> fan, having only seen him in teen type movies, however he is quite compelling in this role. Ledger plays <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s most notorious killer. <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON> is great in a supporting role as <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>'s society lover. Highly recommended - and that's from an Aussie!
490 0 Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.<br /><br />The opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.<br /><br />And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius.<br /><br />The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.<br /><br />
491 1 The only reason I wanted to see this was because of <ORGANIZATION>Orlando Bloom</ORGANIZATION>. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad, but it's really not very good. The editing is good; the film is well-paced. The direction is competent and assured. The story is plodding. The film is averagely acted by Ledger, <ORGANIZATION>Bloom</ORGANIZATION>, and the normally great <LOCATION>Watts</LOCATION> and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you're from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON>). By the end of the film, I was neither bored nor moved. Some people have asked what happened to <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> at the end of the movie. I have to say, I so did not care by that point.<br /><br />Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> kind of, sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present "I'm pretty and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price. Other than that, just don't see it. It's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining.
492 0 This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of <PERSON>Jules Verne</PERSON>'s "Mysterious Island". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and shot around <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. For those living in <LOCATION>New Engalnd</LOCATION> and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. "OK now stand up." As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was <PERSON>Brett Piper</PERSON>'s early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like <PERSON>Karl Zeman</PERSON> animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a <PERSON>Ray Harryhausen</PERSON> epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.
493 1 How could I possibly pass up the chance to see <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> together? Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this mess of a movie.<br /><br />I had never heard of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and <PERSON>Bloom</PERSON> managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /><br />Though I flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. <br /><br />6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )
494 0 It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION> (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION> airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10
495 1 I loves this movie,because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved! <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> did a great job portraying <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>. It has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that. The language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there. This movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers! I hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book Ned looked at! Also that that is how people remember them,from their armor. I hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as I have.
496 0 When will the hurting stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. As if people learn. The numerous different versions of this film prove that we donÂ´t.
497 1 '<PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>' is a wonderfully made Australian film honouring a true Australian hero. We are taken into the world of <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>, his best friend, <PERSON>Joe Byrne</PERSON>, and the other members of the <PERSON>Kelly Gang</PERSON>, as the film explains and perhaps justifies <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s actions.<br /><br />There is an exceptional cast present, who all give stellar performances, which brings the film to life. (Great job, <PERSON>Heath</PERSON>!) <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> was fantastic as <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladiesman very well. I was swept up in the moment. For a moment I almost believed the Gang would win the battle at <LOCATION>Glenrowan</LOCATION>, alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this. Perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the <ORGANIZATION>Kelly Gang</ORGANIZATION>'s/<PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s life - I felt not enough was covered.<br /><br />Regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving film, which stirs all sorts of emotions. (And hey, I'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than <PERSON>Mick Jagger</PERSON> trying to portray Ned...)
498 0 Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> was terrific as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: "Merry Christmas to everyone!" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON> short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the <PERSON>Bill Murray</PERSON> comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...
499 1 I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention <PERSON>Orlando Bloom</PERSON> ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.
500 0 Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. <PERSON>Alistair Sim</PERSON> portrayed the role infinitely better. When <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> was at his meanest, you don't get the sense <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the <PERSON>Alistair Sim</PERSON> version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.
501 1 Those who know who know the <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. <PERSON>Naomi Watt</PERSON>'s character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best Ned (not hard considering the previous <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s include <ORGANIZATION>Yahoo Serious</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mick Jagger</PERSON> & former <PERSON>Carlton</PERSON> champion (Australian Rules Football) <PERSON>Bob Chitty</PERSON>, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting film in the area I live, <PERSON>Bacchus Marsh</PERSON> outside <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION>Clunes & Ballarat</ORGANIZATION>.
502 0 I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with <PERSON>Jacob Marley</PERSON>.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> did a good job with the "reformed" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON> had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...
503 1 'Had <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> been born later he probably would have won a <ORGANIZATION>Victoria Cross</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Gallipolli</LOCATION>'. such was <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s Bravery.<br /><br />In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and especially country <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> the name <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> can be said and immediately recognised. In <PERSON>Greta</PERSON> he is still a Hero, the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in <LOCATION>Mansfield</LOCATION> they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there.<br /><br />Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the Old <LOCATION>Melbourne Gaol</LOCATION> where he was hanged, to the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> office he held up in <LOCATION>Jerilderie</LOCATION>. A cell he was once held in in <LOCATION>Greta</LOCATION> is on display in <LOCATION>Benella</LOCATION> and the site of <PERSON>Ann Jones</PERSON>' Hotel, the station and even the logs where he was captured in <LOCATION>Glenrowan</LOCATION> can be visited.<br /><br />Evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, in police records and even in the Sash that <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> was awarded with for rescuing <PERSON>Dick Shelton</PERSON> from drowning. None of this is wrong, and whats left out would further justify Neds actions. The Horse that <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> 'stole' was actually stolen by <PERSON>Wild Wright</PERSON> (the man who <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> boxes with after getting out of jail). <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it.<br /><br />The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before. It is not self justification it is <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> stood for.
504 0 Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON>, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of <PERSON>Bernard Cribbins</PERSON>. As Scrooge, <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except <PERSON>Frank Finlay</PERSON>, who chronically overacts.
505 1 The performances were superb, the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a Victorian Living Historian, I was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.<br /><br />I wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.<br /><br />OK, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film. <PERSON>Gregor Jordan</PERSON> said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.<br /><br />See it and you WILL NOT be sorry
506 0 The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a <PERSON>Takashi</PERSON> film and nothing <PERSON>Takashi</PERSON> does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> is go with some of the standards like <PERSON>Gozu</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ichi</PERSON>, and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp, <LOCATION>Fudoh</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rainy Dog</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Bird People of China</LOCATION>.
507 1 The story of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. What ensures <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. The more the stories try to portray <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.<br /><br />Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine, a novel about the <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> legend, excels. Rather than attempting to portray a <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here, <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No, I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> gang were distinctly Irish, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).<br /><br /><PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON> does an amazing job of impersonating <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> himself. <LOCATION>Orlando Bloom</LOCATION> has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON>'s appearance as the leader of the police contingent at <LOCATION>Glenrowan</LOCATION> goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON>, appearing as <PERSON>Julia Cook</PERSON>, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> was essentially the woman in <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>'s life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for <PERSON>Watts</PERSON>, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at <LOCATION>Glenrowan</LOCATION>. Annoyingly, the trial and execution of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.<br /><br />That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. For that reason, I rated it a seven out of ten. Other critics have not been so kind, so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere. Especially if you want a more factual account of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>'s life.
508 0 Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON>, and is about as scary as...well, <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON>. (Just try to imagine <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The <ORGANIZATION>Blair Witch Project</ORGANIZATION>, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION> with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>'s character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.
509 1 I'm sure that not many people outside of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have ever heard of the legend of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>. I once saw a documentary about the man, but that's the only time I once saw or heard anything about him. And I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. No-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>'s life. The Irish immigrant has lived in north-west <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> all his life, but has never been very welcome by the authorities. The police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family. When <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men. They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. All this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are outlawed. Finally they take over a pub in <LOCATION>Glenrowan</LOCATION>, where they have a party with all the visitors, waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up. But the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen...<br /><br />It's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false. I guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON>, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief. I really couldn't tell you which of them is right, perhaps both are, but what I can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.<br /><br />This movie was a nice addition to the documentary I once saw and I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. <PERSON>Heath Ledger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Orlando Bloom</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Naomi Watts</PERSON>, <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON> are all actors who are pretty well known, but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.5/10
510 0 Are you familiar with concept of children's artwork? While it is not the greatest <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. If painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. Typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. Well, this concept of children's artwork is how I felt about <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON>'s depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait. While on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON>'s style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. If you have seen either Training Day or King <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait. While <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON>'s name appears on so many "Best OfÂ…" film lists.<br /><br />I will never disagree with someone that <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON>'s eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. I am surprised that more of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon. Even in the silly feature Bait, you are witness to <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON>'s greatness. Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. In both of these scenes I saw the director <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> at work. Alas, in the rest of this film, all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. The likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. We have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are <PERSON>Charlie Kaufmann</PERSON>), you cannot recreate the wheel. It is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with Bait. I was annoyed with <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. I was just tired of the structure, and while I hoped that <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> would redefine it, he did not.<br /><br />Then, there was the acting. While <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> has never impressed me as an actor, I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral. I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> could handle the role in Collateral. Again, I was disappointed. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> was annoying. Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> took the time to fully train <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot. Instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> just trying to make the audience laugh. Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> should have stopped this immediately. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>'s jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. Instead of character development, he would crack a joke. Neither style worked, no joke was funny. The rest of the cast was average. By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles. They were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. They were pawns filling in dead air space. <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.<br /><br />Overall, this was a sad film. With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. In each scene I saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. Are my words harsh? I don't think so. When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. Bait contained none of these. While I will give <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON> some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. Apparently, I took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch)
511 1 There are few films that leave me with the feeling that <PERSON>Gregor Jordan</PERSON>'s '<PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON>' film did. Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself. Since then, I have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. It is also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. This film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. The cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might I add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. It is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. However, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. In reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history. For example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between <PERSON>Joe Byrne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aaron Sheritt</PERSON>, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only <PERSON>Aaron Sheritt</PERSON>'s efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. However, I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. It certainly inspired me to look more closely. So, watch it and decide for yourself. You might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine. Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience? For me, I'd call it a breath of fresh air!
512 0 What? Is <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> supposed to be funny?Does he really believe he is funny?Well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.The man has no identity whatsoever...I mean you can immediately see who his idols are, <PERSON>Denzel Washington</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin Lawrence</PERSON>, because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.The only problem is that he does it bad, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like <LOCATION>Denzel</LOCATION>, with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being <PERSON>Martin Lawrence</PERSON>, the funny and clumsy-silly comic. There's no personal touch to all that, I mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He really is Mr. <PERSON>Dull-boy</PERSON> in person.<br /><br />I was really hoping <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, and the black community in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> would find somebody better to launch into super stardom, like <PERSON>Don Cheadle</PERSON> for example, but perhaps the pathetic <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> better represents the generation that remixes the old.
513 1 Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was, I didn't go and see this film at the cinema. After watching it on DVD, I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant, but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />People have skulls thicker than <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think <PERSON>Ganghis Kahn</PERSON> has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> actually was is a matter of debate, and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> has become a legend. Legends are stories, and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. <PERSON>Ned Kelly</PERSON> has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger.<br /><br />So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> gang, I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians, watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas, such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically, I actually enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that most of the focus on <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians.<br /><br />This movie was always going to have a hard time, having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>'s spirit is in this movie, because I think it rebelled against people's expectations, and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>, and that is why I liked it. <ORGANIZATION>Orlando Bloom</ORGANIZATION>'s performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf, for a change.<br /><br />When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than <ORGANIZATION>Croc Dundee</ORGANIZATION> or The Man From <LOCATION>Snowy River</LOCATION> anytime.
514 0 I love <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>.<br /><br />And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see.<br /><br />And I walked out of this one.<br /><br />Now, I admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON>'s knocking on a door! HEE HEE HEE!"), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.<br /><br />The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point, it's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you've heard before, and too many "tough guy" lines... and I don't mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. In fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.<br /><br />I love <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>, and I think he's really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /><br />This movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>. I gave it a 2.
515 1 ***SPOILERS*** All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, <PERSON>Jimmy Davis</PERSON>, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like <PERSON>Jimmy Davis</PERSON>, are forced to take up arms for their country.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> who at first wanted to be kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION>US Army</ORGANIZATION> but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend <PERSON>Fred P. Willis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Spencer Tracy</PERSON>, ended up on the front lines in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. With <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>'s unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.<br /><br />Recovering from his wounds at an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> hospital <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> fell in love with <ORGANIZATION>US Army</ORGANIZATION> volunteer nurse <PERSON>Rose Duffy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gladys George</PERSON>. <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> was really in love with <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>'s good friend the happy go lucky <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It's when <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> was lost during the fighting on the <ORGANIZATION>Western Front</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Rose</PERSON>, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>. When <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> unexpectedly showed up in the French town where <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> who had already accepted <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>'s proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />With WWI over and <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> marrying <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> left <PERSON>Fred</PERSON>, who's still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> ran into <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> on the streets of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the <ORGANIZATION>European Western Front</ORGANIZATION>. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> had become a top mobster in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s underworld! Not only that but as <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> later found out his wife <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> had no idea what <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> was really involved in with <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>'s life of crime came full circle when <PERSON>Rose</PERSON>, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a "Valentine Day" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> and his best friend <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> were having an affair behind his back <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It's at <PERSON>Fred</PERSON>'s circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> in seeing that <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> as well as <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>! It was then that <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!
516 0 This is the first time I ever saw a movie with <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>, and I bet it will be my last. I failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying "I am going to take a shower".<br /><br />The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. In between, the officials screwing up. The final scenes are utterly unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?<br /><br />There's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> style. Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />
517 1 Sandwiched in between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and Captains Courageous two of <PERSON>Spencer Tracy</PERSON>'s greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people. They Gave Him A Gun stars <PERSON>Spencer Tracy</PERSON> and Franchot Tone in the only film they ever made together and <PERSON>Gladys George</PERSON> as the woman who loves them both.<br /><br /><PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> and Tone are a couple of World War I draftees, Tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp, but <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> stops him. <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> is still playing the lovable blowhard, younger <PERSON>Wallace Beery</PERSON> type that <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> envisioned for him when they signed him away from <PERSON>Fox</PERSON>. <br /><br />Over at the front Tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a German machine gun nest. He's learned to shoot by now and he does a Sergeant <PERSON>York</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Alvin C. York</PERSON> was never changed by the war the way Tone has.<br /><br />Wounded in the fight Tone convalesces at a hospital with <PERSON>Gladys George</PERSON> looking out for him. <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> goes AWOL himself to visit his pal and he and <PERSON>George</PERSON> get something going. Later on when <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> is reported missing in action, Tone and <PERSON>George</PERSON> marry. <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON>'s brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage, but takes sit in stride. <br /><br />The rest of the film is dealing with Tone applying the the wartime skills he's learned to the gangster trade. He's a hit-man now and <PERSON>George</PERSON> doesn't really know what he does for a living. I think you can figure the rest out.<br /><br />The part of the film that gave me some trouble is that I can't believe <PERSON>Gladys George</PERSON> couldn't figure it out. She's a street smart girl, her part is very much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite <PERSON>James Cagney</PERSON>.<br /><br />Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, <PERSON>Humphrey Bogart</PERSON>'s character development there is similar to Tone's although he was not the central character of the movie. In fact there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that are to be found in Taxi Driver and in <PERSON>Clint Eastwood</PERSON>'s classic, The Unforgiven. <br /><br />The World War I battle sequences are very well staged by director <PERSON>Woody Van Dyke</PERSON>. For some reason <PERSON>Leonard Maltin</PERSON> panned this film, I think it's a lot better than he gave it credit.
518 0 photography was too jumpy to follow. dark scenes hard to see.<br /><br />Had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere. Too noisy for what was really happening Bottom line is it's a baddddd movie
519 1 For a danish movie, I have to say, that this is very good movie.<br /><br />It's in a class of its own, yet it has an international potential.<br /><br />The movie has a big budget, and is starring famous danish actors, and a few newcomers, who play very well. It can be watched by anyone who like adventures, and a little bit of 'ghost' movie.<br /><br />Don't be afraid, be thrilled!
520 0 Well, i can and will be very short. This is a wrong-balanced, non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better. The script seems to not know which way to go ... from funny to cliche-wise serious... it's a bit silly. That plus too much sentences we have heard before "the hacker is in florida, or no, he is in madrid, no he is in ... , he is screwing the signal". <br /><br />4 out of 10
521 1 Wow! A Danish movie with this kind of content? I mean, the actors, the story, the pictures, the efx - everything was where it should be. <br /><br />And a Danish EFX house producing those VFX - Wow! This is like the 2nd or 3rd time a Danish FX has produces visual effects in that quality.<br /><br />*SPOILER AHEAD* The twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good, but generally I did not feel the big chill which I would expect from a ghost-movie. *END OF SPOILER*<br /><br />But anyway, this is a Danish movie which I as a Dane can be proud of.<br /><br />The only "bad" about this, is that it wasn't a Danish director, but a Swedish...
522 0 <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> is fun but this movie has been done before. The bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "In the Line of Fire". The cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf...
523 1 I went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself in order to convince her that I was not scared. In many ways still a childrenÂ´s story, but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential. Could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience.
524 0 <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> follows in the footsteps of the likes of <PERSON>Chris Tucker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin Lawrence</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dave Chapple</PERSON>, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).<br /><br />Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala <PERSON>Marlon Wayans</PERSON> portrayal in Requiem to a Dream. Or In Living Color's <PERSON>Tommy Davidson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Damon Wayans</PERSON> moving performances in <PERSON>Spike Lee</PERSON>'s satire Bamboozled.
525 1 ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />This movie, "The Divers", is really interesting. All I roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history, underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking Danish. But I decided to check it out for one reason, the fact that the story evolves around a sunken WWII German submarine. I've got a fetish for German subs, especially wrecks that can be dived upon. So I was a bit sceptical about the Danish part, but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part. Knowing that Nordic films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size I was, to say the least, very sceptical.<br /><br />Upon viewing I was ... surprised.<br /><br />I had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate, seeing how some are very young, the two main actors in particular. This was not an issue, they both perform very well. As do the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond. This makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. Not unique in anyway, but somewhat rare. And it's all good.<br /><br />As for the Danish language, it is nearly impossible to understand. But this was no problem, it had subtitles.<br /><br />Another issue was the submarine itself, I suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine. Having decided their budget was slim, I thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst. Again I was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German subs, I knew what the sub should look like, especially inside, and was not let down. The team has done some serious research. It's all good.<br /><br />I suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so I feel I must issue a "warning". The submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. It's a special purpose sub. But to give you a hint of what to expect, it's a crossing between a Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese transport sub similar to I-52. It's god a good design and makes a nice wreck.<br /><br />The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula, I can't remember. It's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. Their grandfather is a mariner of sorts. The cinematography is quite nice, a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks, some newfound teenage love, nice diving weather and a general feeling of "perfect". Once again, it's all good.<br /><br />Plot-wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind, a gathering of men hire one of the boats, an old minesweeper and it's crew. One of the visitors, a man in his 50's, has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back. The island's senior citizens all remember when a german u-boat was sunk towards the end of world war II and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945. No submarine was ever found.<br /><br />WHAT TO EXPECT<br /><br />Key elements are nazi experiments, nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy, and ...a surprise.<br /><br />*** WARNING - SPOILER ***<br /><br />I had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem. It's not like "From dusk til dawn" where everybody turns into vampires towards the end. This is a bit more subtle.<br /><br />OVERALL : Really good movie, I gave it an 8. Some due to the fact that it isn't a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned Danish veterans. But even if this had been a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> production, I would give it a 7 or 8. Definately worth your while. Yes, a child's story in a way, but then again a mature tale. It has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure, which I found very appealing. And, again, the cinematography is really nice.<br /><br />/Medusa 2001<br /><br />
526 0 After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of acting ability in <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night.
527 1 This was a strong Poirot/Suchet, television mystery selection. The characters were vivid and well-acted. The plot and the main setting--a student hostel-- were excellent. <PERSON>Japp</PERSON> was nothing special but for me did not distract from story. One significant point, many <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> watchers don't recognize good acting or good characterization. I also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> mysteries. Finally, I have read few <PERSON>Christie</PERSON> novels--none in recent years-- and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel. Please, viewers, consider what is presented to you on film, not what you think should be there. That said, the <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe. With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, the longer <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> films are neither that good or that bad. For the record, I have seen all the longer Poirot/Suchet films. Finally, films without <LOCATION>Lemon</LOCATION>, Hastings, and/or <PERSON>Japp</PERSON> are neither good nor bad because of their absence. There presence, however, is either obtrusive (almost always with <PERSON>Japp</PERSON>) or irrelevant with <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON>. Lemon is in the middle.
528 0 ...that <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> would ever deliver such a wonderful, Oscar-winning performance. One of the reasons why I was so impressed with <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>'s performance in "Ray" was because from watching his hammy, obnoxious acting in movies like "Bait" and "Booty Call," I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar. If people told me five years ago that <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> was one day going to win an Oscar, I would laugh right in their faces. Who knows? Maybe he's better off sticking to drama, because if you watch "Bait," it's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte. I swear, <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> mugs so much in this movie that I'm surprised his face didn't fall off. And why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? Anyone familiar with comedians like <PERSON>Bob Newhart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Wright</PERSON> knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious. If a joke is funny, it's funny. If it's not funny, then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier. The problem I have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character. In real life, normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips. Like <PERSON>Albert Brooks</PERSON> said in an interview discussing his character in "Taxi Driver," it's important to be funny as your character, rather than be funny as a comedian. A prime example of <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken, and he starts posing for the photographs like a model. If a regular person were being thrown in jail, would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? And wouldn't the police try to scold him if he was? There are many scenes like that throughout the film. Another awful sequence is one where <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain, and he starts doing a phony Caribbean accent. Not funny! Not to mention <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke. Giving a comedic performance requires patience, whereas he goes straight to the punchline, whether it's the right time for it or not. I'm not even a big <PERSON>Mike Epps</PERSON> fan, but even his performance is good in comparison to <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON>'s. As a matter of fact, this is the first time I felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen. <PERSON>Epps</PERSON> has the same flaws when it comes to comedy, but at least he chooses a more low-key approach. One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON>, a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains. He seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality. However, fellow "Green Mile" star <PERSON>Doug Hutchison</PERSON> is disgustingly over-the-top as the villain. A big surprise, considering he gave a superb performance in "The Green Mile," also playing a heavy. <PERSON>Antoine Fuqua</PERSON> has proved his directing chops in movies like "The Replacement Killers" and "Training Day." Even in "Bait," he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence. His only problem seemed to be in disciplining <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>, who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another. Unless you're a die-hard fan of <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>, please don't take the bait.
529 1 <PERSON>Hickory Dickory Dock</PERSON> was a good <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> mystery. I confess I have not read the book, despite being an avid <PERSON>Agatha Christie</PERSON> fan. The adaptation isn't without its problems, there were times when the humour, and there were valiant attempts to get it right, was a little overdone, and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed. I also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded. However, I loved how <PERSON>Hickory Dickory Dock</PERSON> was filmed, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> Murders, and it really set the atmosphere, what with the dark camera work and dark lighting. The darker moments were somewhat creepy, this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> adaptation, maybe not as disturbing as the one in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, though not as convoluted as Buckle My Shoe,and in some way that is a good thing. The acting was very good, <PERSON>David Suchet</PERSON> is impeccable(I know I can't use this word forever but I can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Phillip Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pauline Moran</PERSON> do justice to their integral characters brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole, particularly <PERSON>Damian Lewis</PERSON> as <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON>. All in all, solid mystery but doesn't rank along the best. 7.5/10 <ORGANIZATION>Bethany Cox</ORGANIZATION>
530 0 The plot of this terrible film is so convoluted I've put the spoiler warning up because I'm unsure if I'm giving anything away. The audience first sees some man in Jack the Ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. Then we're up to modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house. We're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. Some 105 year old woman lived there. There are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. An old fashioned straight-razor falls out when they're renovating and the husband keeps it. I guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. Oh yeah, the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks. <br /><br />Some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person. Late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money & the husband murders the body guard & a co-worker and steals the money. His wife is suddenly pregnant. <br /><br />What the hell is going on?? Who knows?? NOTHING is explained. Was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer? The baby sister? WHY were iron panels put on the wall? How would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar? Was he locked down there by his family & starved to death or just concealed? WHO is Mr. <PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels?? He's never seen again. WHY was the serial killer killing people? We only see the one old man murdered. Was there a pattern or motive or something?? WHY does the wife suddenly become pregnant? Is it the demon spawn of the serial killer? Has he managed to infiltrate the husband's semen? And why, if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge, burly security guard, is he unable to overpower his wife? And just how powerful is the voltage system in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire? And why does the wife stay in the house? Is she now possessed by the serial killer? Is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated? <br /><br />This movie was such a frustrating experience I wanted to call my PBS station and ask for my money back! The ONLY enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time, but even that couldn't redeem this muddled, incoherent mess.
531 1 A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister's boarding house has Miss Lemon quite agitated. A ring, light bulbs, a rucksack, a lighter, a stethoscope, a shoe Â– there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it. Miss <PERSON>Lemon</PERSON> asks her employer, the great Belgian detective <PERSON>Hercule Poirot</PERSON>, to look into the matter. But what <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> sees is something far more sinister than Miss <PERSON>Lemon</PERSON> could have imagined. And <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON>'s fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered. It's up to <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON> to bring a killer to justice.<br /><br />Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid, but not spectacular, entry in the long running Poirot series. I appreciate how faithful the script is to <PERSON>Agatha Christie</PERSON>'s original story. I realize that certain liberties had to be taken, but I appreciate the effort nonetheless. The major points of the mystery are all there Â– the petty thefts, the boarding house, the students, the ripped rucksack, and, of course, <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON>'s ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens. With a few exceptions, the cast of students is almost as I pictured them. <PERSON>Damian Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jessica Lloyd</PERSON> standout among the group. As mush as I always enjoy <PERSON>David Suchet</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Poirot</PERSON>, I get a real kick out of the episodes with <PERSON>Phillip Jackson</PERSON>'s Inspector <PERSON>Japp</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pauline Moran</PERSON>'s Miss Lemon. This episode is a real treat as Miss <PERSON>Lemon</PERSON> gets more screen time than usual. Finally, I enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel. It's a fun little play on the Hickory Dickory Dock title.<br /><br />I realized while re-watching Hickory Dickory Dock just what a tremendous influence <PERSON>Agatha Christie</PERSON>'s work was on the highly stylized Italian mystery films, or Gialli, of the 60s and 70s. Take the murder of Mrs. <PERSON>Nicoletis</PERSON> as an example. If you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene, you would have something straight out of an early 70s Giallo. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could have been used in a Giallo. It's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked.
532 0 You'd better choose <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>'s even if you have watched it.
533 1 This story was never among my favourites in <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they weren't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting didn't allow for that! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because I've not long re-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on.<br /><br /><PERSON>Humour</PERSON> was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though I did smile at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line). Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.
534 0 The episodic version of <PERSON>Robert Heinlein</PERSON>'s Starship Troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace, following <PERSON>Johnny Rico</PERSON> leaving his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he lusts for, and joining the mobile infantry. The aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film, instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths.<br /><br />Throughout watching this version, I was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing. The show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits, and the aching, prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors, with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes. In terms of construction, it owes a debt to Top Gun, sharing much in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies).
535 1 It all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on <LOCATION>Hickory Road</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Concerned for her sister, who is the housekeeper there, <LOCATION>Miss Lemon</LOCATION> asks <PERSON>Hercule Poirot</PERSON> to look into the matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes get higher when a girl, who had admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the thefts, is found murdered.<br /><br />"Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being as mind-numbingly complicated as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". Murder, theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved, and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, particularly the psychology student <PERSON>Colin McNabb</PERSON> and the mysterious American girl <PERSON>Sally Finch</PERSON>, Inspector <PERSON>Japp</PERSON> has his funny moments (in perhaps the closest this series has come to "toilet humor"), and Miss <PERSON>Lemon</PERSON> gets a more integral part to the story than usual. (***)
536 0 1 How is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes? Did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth, in different time frames (Attilla the <PERSON>Hun</PERSON> wasn't a contemporary of preliterate Hellenic cultures, nor were the <PERSON>Vikings</PERSON> contemporary to the Pyramid builders) speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day English(except for the inflections they "do not" use), which has been influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /><br />2 Cultural differences can't be overcome so easily, trust has to be won, yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders. Of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods. The people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like.<br /><br />3 Historical background: none. Visually it might vaguely remind you of Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part. A small-town theater group probably has better props.<br /><br />4 Boring! Another lame Canuck production, which inexplicably ran for ten long years. As a kids show it could make the grade, but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1, like I just did. I very much wanted to believe I had found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes!
537 1 I loved <PERSON>Dedee Pfeiffer</PERSON> (is that spelled right?) in <PERSON>Cybil</PERSON>. Haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job in this. The supporting cast was pretty good too. In some angles, the daughter even looked like a young <PERSON>Nicole Kidman</PERSON>. The abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists. The young boyfriend was a hottie. I thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure.<br /><br />Just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and am loving these movies. Kept my interest and I'll watch it again when they rerun it. Can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you want. Thanks in advance. Aboutagirly.
538 0 Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say this show sucks. <br /><br />What bothers me the most, is that the show was shot in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. Here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it's so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. <br /><br />And then there is <PERSON>Richard Dean Anderson</PERSON>. He is no <PERSON>Kurt Russel</PERSON>. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit, but he is just not as cool as <PERSON>Russel</PERSON>. And not nearly as good an actor as <PERSON>Russel</PERSON>. And Russells way of playing <PERSON>O Neill</PERSON>, well he was much more cynical. <PERSON>Andersons O Neil</PERSON>, is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. <br /><br /><PERSON>Michael Shanks</PERSON> does a really good job as <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> though taking over from <PERSON>James Spader</PERSON>.<br /><br />Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is <LOCATION>Jaffa</LOCATION>. Not a <LOCATION>Jaffa</LOCATION>. Just <LOCATION>Jaffa</LOCATION>. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from <PERSON>Jean Claude Van Damme</PERSON>.<br /><br />And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /><br />As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /><br />The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode, that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. <br /><br />Incredibly boring and pointless show, that could have been great if they had shot the show in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
539 1 I'm a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the good ones. The cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists I didn't see coming before each commercial. To me it was kind of like Medium meets CSI.<br /><br />Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young <PERSON>Nicole Kidman</PERSON>? Are they related in any way? I'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video.<br /><br /><PERSON>Dedee</PERSON> was great. Haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly.<br /><br />If you're into to TV mystery movies, check this one out if you have a chance.
540 0 Im watching it now on pink (<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> TV station) and I must say this is a crap. Shallow, no acting, effects too sloppy I mean, who made this series?<br /><br />This was a stupid attempt of the Studios to make some more money on the success of the film. OK. The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series?<br /><br />Some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write that, was that someones relative at the Studio? This is no SciFi.<br /><br />The film was the bomb, the series suck.
541 1 I have to say, Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The perception I took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but I was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery.<br /><br /><PERSON>Dedee Pfeiffer</PERSON> is <PERSON>Emilie</PERSON>, a mom who insists her daughter, <PERSON>Lori</PERSON> (<PERSON>Tegan Moss</PERSON>), not attend a so-called graduation party one weeknight, but <PERSON>Lori</PERSON> ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway. When <PERSON>Lori</PERSON> does not come home, <PERSON>Emilie</PERSON> knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance.<br /><br />Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type, as it is not so predictable. <PERSON>Pfeiffer</PERSON> is the reason to see this movie, and most of it comes off as believable. This LMN Original Movie premiered last night. 10/10
542 0 I cannot believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really wouldn't even consider this true sci-fi. Every episode I have sat through was like a lame, watered down version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting.<br /><br />It's basically a bunch of people standing around in ARMY fatigues, talking about something boring, who occasionally go through the Stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, with people who look and sound just like Humans! It seemed extremely low budget. The characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts, and the many attempts at humor fall flat. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he is not. It is just sad.<br /><br />The movie was terrible as well. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING! This shows no imagination! I actually thought the TV series "Alien Nation" from a few years back (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. That show actually had good story lines and decent characters. I wasn't crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this overrated crap, it was great!<br /><br />Also, unlike the great new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! They should have at least updated the cheesy "toilet flushing" special effect of whenever somebody goes through the Stargate.
543 1 It's all about <PERSON>Mitzi</PERSON>. I loved her in this. And didn't she look fantastic?! I love these Lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. This is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times. The <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> character was completely creepy. I've dated guys like that. Well, not totally like that lol. I wish <PERSON>Zack</PERSON> hadn't have gotten killed. He was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. I LOVE these stalker type stories. It always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what <PERSON>Mitzi</PERSON> does next!
544 0 When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We've all been guilty of it at some time or another, but my excuse for watching things like "<ORGANIZATION>Buck Rogers</ORGANIZATION> in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.<br /><br />Thankfully, I now appreciate the good stuff. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stilted dialogue, every bit of needless technobabble. The writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me long for the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble.<br /><br />The film Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by <PERSON>James Spader</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kurt Russell</PERSON>, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas. With the exception of a little of the original music, none of what made the film fun appears in this show. Even <PERSON>Richard Dean Anderson</PERSON>, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep most episodes.<br /><br />The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. The cinematography isn't much better, as vanilla and dull as the scripts. It amazes me that shows with a lot more style (like Farscape) and substance (like the reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have smaller, less rabid fanbases than this pap. It just doesn't deserve it.
545 1 Loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager.The movie, was presented well, with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing. Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter. The progression of situations were cleverly written,making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what I thought might be the obvious. Too bad there have to be commercials.I have told many friends to watch for further showings and I of course will view again.I enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue. Husband and wife heated discussions(or should I say fights?) were very realistic.The initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not.I want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film. Thank you! Looking forward to the next films---when? <LOCATION>Whidbey</LOCATION>
546 0 The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION>, author <PERSON>Lillian Hellman</PERSON> has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story "<PERSON>Julia</PERSON>" from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most odious of a plethora of Western-based <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator <PERSON>Stalin</PERSON> and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.<br /><br />As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and movie, as <PERSON>Lillian</PERSON> went to her grave an American-loathing communist. This film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the American Left then, just as now the full mooner Left of The <ORGANIZATION>Daily Kos</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Michael Moore</PERSON> has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
547 1 It's hard for me to criticize anything that <PERSON>Mitzi Kapture</PERSON> does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. That notwithstanding, yes, the plot was predictable. I think perhaps if <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> HAD slept with <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would have added more to the suspense. It would have also been nice to see <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> and her husband find out about <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a bit more back story. I was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie. I would have liked to have seen more closure with <PERSON>Zack</PERSON>'s death and possibly closure with her husband. I do have to say though, I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there. It was a very fitting end for <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>. Of course, <PERSON>Mitzi</PERSON> ROCKED! I am so looking forward to her future projects.
548 0 There seems to be little in the way of middle ground where Watch On the <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION> is concerned. One either likes it very much, applauding its sincerity, its liberal point of view and fine acting, or else loathes its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness. I fall very much in the latter category, and found the film and play,--concerning the activities of European refugees in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> during wartime--a crushing bore, worthwhile mostly for the acting, and even then only intermittently. That author <PERSON>Lillian Hellman</PERSON> was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the "other side" is. Even when I find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say,--as in <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION>--I still can't stand the way she says it. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I thoroughly agree with the late <PERSON>Mary McCarthy</PERSON>'s long overdue dismantling of <PERSON>Hellman</PERSON> reputation some years ago. For those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days, I urge a peek at Watch On the <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION>, as bad in its way as <ORGANIZATION>Angels In America</ORGANIZATION>, which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago.
549 1 I watch most movies that <PERSON>Nick Mancuso</PERSON> is in because, frankly, I love the guy, even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie (long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick). It's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot (but then most movies these days aren't exactly original), but <PERSON>Rick Roberts</PERSON> is appealing as the imperfect husband, <PERSON>Martha MacIsaac</PERSON> is equally appealing as the daughter, and <PERSON>Mitzi Kapture</PERSON> does a good job, if that was her goal, of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like. <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place off-screen -- like motivation, prior behaviors, good times and bad times -- and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience (i.e., me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "but what about..." category, and overall, I can't say that I cared much about any of the characters. That being said, it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and I still like <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>.
550 0 It as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy. It is not only oppressively preachy, but absurd, stagebound, dramatically straight-jacketed, and painfully overwrought. Watching it, one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write "I will not become a fascist" on the blackboard 100 times.<br /><br />Now I understand that it was made during the height of WW2, and was intended to be a brave condemnation of <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> and the terrible suffering he brought about, (which anyone would whole-heartedly applaud) and I'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day. But it is presented in such an immature, over-obvious, sledgehammer way, it fails abysmally as a work of art.<br /><br />The only good performances here are from <PERSON>Paul Lukas</PERSON>, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist; and <PERSON>Lucile Watson</PERSON> as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships, the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snips. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And <PERSON>Bette Davis</PERSON>, a great actress, here is so one dimensionally noble I cringed every time she was on screen. Her every word, her every gesture is meant to convey how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING she is of the SACRIFICES her husband has to make and the great CAUSE he is fighting for, that she must've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal.<br /><br />So yes, this is a very IMPORTANT film, just not a very good one.
551 1 This film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter <PERSON>Martha MacIssac</PERSON> (<PERSON>Olivia Dunne</PERSON>) was very much in love with <PERSON>Joe MacLeod</PERSON>,(<PERSON>Zack</PERSON>). The mother is played by <PERSON>Mitzi Kapture</PERSON>,(<PERSON>Jill Dunne</PERSON>) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and <PERSON>Zack</PERSON> making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface. <PERSON>Jill Dunne</PERSON> has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often. There are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter <PERSON>Olivia</PERSON> dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs. In many ways, <PERSON>Olivia</PERSON> does an outstanding performance as the teenage and <PERSON>Nick Mancuso</PERSON>,(<PERSON>Richard Grant</PERSON>) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner. This film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror. Enjoy
552 0 The characters are cliched and predictable, with everyone being either snow-white pure or wholly evil. The acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing, over-the-top way. It's doubly disappointing if you're a <PERSON>Bette Davis</PERSON> fan, because her character is not a typically fun <LOCATION>Bette-Davis-type</LOCATION> character; she just gets to frown pensively a lot.<br /><br />On the whole, neither my wife nor I found the movie to be interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.
553 1 When you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing, you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work. Undying used the Unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience. The production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game. The game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision. The level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you.
554 0 <PERSON>Lillian Hellman</PERSON>'s play, adapted by <PERSON>Dashiell Hammett</PERSON> with help from <PERSON>Hellman</PERSON>, becomes a curious project to come out of gritty <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Paul Lukas</PERSON>, reprising his <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> role and winning the Best Actor Oscar, plays an anti-Nazi German underground leader fighting the Fascists, dragging his American wife and three children all over <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> before finding refuge in the States (via the <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> border). They settle in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the German Embassy playing poker. It seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest, direct refugees teaching the clueless, head-in-the-sand Americans how the world has suddenly changed), it seems a little patronizing--the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place, being lectured to. <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> has several speeches in the third-act which undoubtedly won him the Academy Award, yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit, enter and exit. As his spouse, <PERSON>Bette Davis</PERSON> enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage, but the role doesn't allow her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) are alternately humorous and annoying, and <PERSON>Geraldine Fitzgerald</PERSON> has a nothing role as a put-upon wife (and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong). The intent here was to tastefully, tactfully show us just because a (WWII-era) man may be German, that doesn't make him a Nazi sympathizer. We get that in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactful movie is made up of exposition, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a heady mix, but instead it's rather dry-eyed and inert. ** from ****
555 1 Not being a fan of first person shooters I was very hesitant to play this game. After having played the demo however I was sold. "Undying" really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in. You have this green amulet,called the "Gel'ziabar Stone" that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at. With a special spell "the scrye" you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you. Walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper:" Look",with the stone glowing at for example a painting. And then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting. Let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell. People who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats. This game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around. Because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark. And ghosts and monster appear at random when you don't expect them and can kill you very quickly. There is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened. This was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic "Evil Dead"! To experience something like this is a real accomplishment. There are a lot of elements that take "Undying" to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced. But sadly I have to report that there are some flaws. For one thing the universe you are playing in is huge. You start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden,secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called "Oneiros". That is all fine in the beginning. But with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating. And there is no map. The game demands you memorize your surroundings. So patience is required. Also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you can't progress. I don't mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures. But in first person mode that can be an annoying task. Luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace. And trust me you will need it. Overall "Undying" is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan.
556 0 I'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking Matrix, I'm thinking <PERSON>Bladerunner</PERSON>, I'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in <LOCATION>Angel</LOCATION>, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her, leave that one with us. Only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike. Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?"<br /><br />Flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. SF just the way <PERSON>Joe Fanboy</PERSON> likes it, in fact. :(
557 1 I gotta say, <PERSON>Clive Barker</PERSON>'s Undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made. I've played Resident Evil, <LOCATION>Silent Hill</LOCATION> and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements. <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> is good at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at, Undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title. I just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor PC sales nipped that one in the bud.
558 0 Wow, here it finally is; the action "movie" without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.<br /><br />There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly "Matrix" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.<br /><br />And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.<br /><br />Believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. In fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money.
559 1 I love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it. The way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit, its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there. The sound effects and audio are amazing. There are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. You get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic. The best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try playing it with head phones on.
560 0 God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot. I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of <PERSON>James Cameron</PERSON> (and not just since "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..). But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular "A-Team" episode. As for <ORGANIZATION>Alba</ORGANIZATION>, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her "gal wit an attitude" schtick pretty soon. You can count me out of this one, Mr. <PERSON>Cameron</PERSON>!
561 1 Undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups. It tells the story of <PERSON>Patrick Galloway</PERSON> an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> to investigate some weird phainomena. The game is set in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> after World War one so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers.All the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on.Our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left.So you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power P.C..Level design is also cool and atmospheric. Mostly the game revolves around the Covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of <PERSON>Clyve Barker</PERSON> the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a First person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent. But the game has two main flaws. First of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration.Secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry. As far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced. Most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult. Overall undying is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
562 0 Awful, simply awful. It proves my theory about "star power." This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who directed (battlestar) <PERSON>Titanica</PERSON> is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick. B O R I N G.<br /><br />Find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your TV with no picture and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.)<br /><br />-Zaphoid<br /><br />PS: My theory about "star power" is: the more "star power" used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1/"star power", less "sp" makes for better quality, etc. Another way to look at it is: "more is less.")<br /><br />-Z
563 1 This game was really great and quite a challenge. It has a great, spooky story line and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all Horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me.<br /><br /> A truly great game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans.<br /><br />>
564 0 What was an exciting and fairly original series by <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of <PERSON>Jessica Alba</PERSON>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> decided that they needed to "fine-tune" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see <PERSON>Jessica Alba</PERSON>!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes, they even had <PERSON>Max</PERSON> sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story (the one that <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> never gets): If it works, don't screw with it!<br /><br />azjazz
565 1 This is undeniably the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee..") and above all incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye, which enables you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past. The only game I've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a great horror fan, escpecially of <PERSON>Clive Barker</PERSON>'s stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm no fps fan, and perhaps the game was a bit short?)
566 0 to movie,this movie felt like one of those after school specials,only lower budget and lower everything else.i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort,but it didn't work for me.yet some how it comes across as preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance,but so what?there just isn't any excitement in this movie.the dialogue is contrived and clichÃ©d to death.of course,the whole movie feels like a bad 80's clichÃ©.the acting was less than stellar,though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given(or in this case-not)to work with.on top of that is the poor song choices,with really bad lyrics.i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved.they are all talented,but you can't tell from this movie.this is just my opinion of course,but i have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe a 1/10
567 1 "The Days" is a typical family drama with a little catch - you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show.<br /><br />[Possible Spoilers For Those Who Are Unfamiliar With the Show]<br /><br />The story, obviously, for all the people who has watched the show, is the world of Cooper Day, the middle child of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister, and a genius-little-brother. The first episode, which is going to sound a bit stupid since <PERSON>John Scott Shepard</PERSON> has created this situation - both the sister and mother gets pregnant. That's the first situation the writer hits. Then the father quits his job at the law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The middle child gets in a fight with the sister's boyfriend. This is all in a day's work.<br /><br />[/Spoilers]<br /><br />I admire this show. I don't know. It's a bit crappy but I like it. First I thought the camera-work was a ripoff but then I got used it and started to like it. I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low-budget style. I liked the acting. I admire the story. Then I find myself wanting a second season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of it as the 6-episode airing on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> came to an end. It's a really good show and it's nothing like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope fans will stop comparing them.<br /><br />And if you can relate to either <PERSON>Abby</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, <PERSON>Natalie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> or even <PERSON>Nate</PERSON>, you'll like this show. A lot.
568 0 I only today, picked this up at the 99 cents only store today, and I still think I got ripped off. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin' expensive for this. This film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young <PERSON>Keanu Reeves</PERSON>. And 2. It's directed by <PERSON>Paul Lynch</PERSON>, the man who also did Promo Night. Now onto the movie. <br /><br />It's about a girl named <PERSON>Robin</PERSON> (Played by <PERSON>Olivia D'Abo</PERSON>) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> (Played by <PERSON>Keanu</PERSON>.) <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>, when not in training, works part-time, along with her mother and stepsister, at a <LOCATION>Laundromat</LOCATION> owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /><br />Overall, <PERSON>Keanu</PERSON> alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of <PERSON>Keanu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Olivia</PERSON> and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as it's also not in the movie itself, so the cover's obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a <PERSON>Keanu</PERSON> fanatic. I probably won't be hanging to it any longer. I'm probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob, who's a great YT critic btw. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight, feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.
569 1 the one and only season has just aired here in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted of <PERSON>Abby Day</PERSON> (mum), <PERSON>Jack Day</PERSON> (dad), <PERSON>Natalie Day</PERSON> (sporty daughter), <PERSON>Cooper Day</PERSON> (outsider son), and <PERSON>Nathan Day</PERSON> (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show I'm gonna miss it.
570 0 It's not really about gymnastics; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery, or microbiology, or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it's about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. <PERSON>Keanu Reeves</PERSON>, warming up for <PERSON>Ted</PERSON>; heroine <PERSON>Olivia D'Abo</PERSON>'s hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand at least they're in the movie. But D'Abo doesn't quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; it's all just bodies hurtling around, and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it's all performed by an obvious double.
571 1 I would just like to say, that no matter how low budget the film is, it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies. We don't read that much anymore, instead people want to see movies. Having this series out on DVD, has made me want to read the whole series, and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. Please don't change any of the characters either, it ruins the effect. Because I have grown to love the actors who have played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message, and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray. We don't get that enough anymore. AWESOME JOB!!!
572 0 What an insult to <PERSON>Olivia D'Abo</PERSON> who plays the film's heroine, <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>, to have <PERSON>Keanu Reeves</PERSON> appear so large on the box art of the film (and at least on recent reissues, to have only <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> appear on the box), considering that she was the star. I realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long-forgotten After School Special, but at least give the woman some credit. <br /><br />Despite that, this has to be one of the worst teen sports-themed films that I have ever seen, and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie clichÃ© from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance. And, in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of Flashdance (with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to <PERSON>Michael Sembello</PERSON>'s notable 'Maniac' which was made famous by Flashdance, or was it the other way around?). It includes similar dance sequences and worse yet, even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance-offs between the heroine and her antagonist(s), the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team. We saw this in <LOCATION>Trashin</LOCATION>' (a vert ramp joust) and Rad (BMX dancing at the prom, although it wasn't much for competition, but rather for fun) for example. In fact, this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness, such as the somewhat homo-erotic rolling in the clothes at the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON>Robin</PERSON> and her friend from the team.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background. To top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible, she lives with her ailing mother, her obnoxious sister, and her careless (and slightly abusive) stepfather. Needless to say, homelife is not so appealing. Add to the mix, a talent for gymnastics, but several obstacles to joining the team (including the nuisance of her arrogant, snobby teammates, and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well). And, of course, we can't forget that she's got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates, nor that she doesn't have a steady boyfriend (although <PERSON>Keanu</PERSON> as <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> later enters the picture). Could this kid be any more pathetic? And it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long, redundant, and clichÃ©d quest to prove her worth to everyone.<br /><br />But, even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film, are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog. (I like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance-off to scold the teammates). It makes episodes of 'Amazing Stories' look like <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>.<br /><br />I imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor. For that you might be satisfied, but it is also an incredibly forced drama. So, <PERSON>Caveat Emptour</PERSON>.
573 1 I read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad....I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person that enjoyed the Waltons or Little House...U will not understand nor enjoy these movies...<br /><br />Now about Loves Abiding Joy...I knew HE was bad news from the start of the movie....I wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it. This movie has a lot to do with <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>....it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in Girls.<br /><br />I want to say that I have enjoyed all 4 movies so far....Was not crazy about the books...Cant wait until the next movie. The way <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> talks will get you every time. I would love to see January <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> do an appearance...Maybe a family reunion or something.
574 0 As an <PERSON>Altman</PERSON> fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />This is one of <PERSON>Altman</PERSON>'s big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It doesn't.<br /><br />As <PERSON>Maltin</PERSON> points out, this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of <PERSON>Alfre Woodard</PERSON>, who outshines the vets all around her. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of <PERSON>Halley</PERSON>'s Comet.)
575 1 We loved the movie. I am a mother to two little men. I love having a movie I can watch with them where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And family's are forever and love means more then words. <br /><br />I do wish we saw more of the <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> family. But over all I loved it left me with the same feeling the others did "please don't be over". We both wish actors would not change.The new actors were good replacement tho.<br /><br />My 9 year old son loved this movie too. asked me to go buy them all. He is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something. Family should all see this move buy it for friends . Help bring back a time of values. We will be Reading the books now that we are hooked. really hope to see more. Be Blessed happy moving
576 0 There was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even lamer. The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film. Sadly, I tried several times to watch this. I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid, and he was four years old. I find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director, as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a B film. That might be pushing it. I did love the theme song. Good thing it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be. Is pot legal in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>?
577 1 This movie was so great! I am a teenager, and I and my friends all love the series, so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when <LOCATION>Logan Bartholomew</LOCATION> says: "rosy cheeks", when he is talking about his baby daughter. He is such a great actor, as well as <PERSON>Erin Cottrell</PERSON>. They pair up so well, and have such a great chemistry! I really hope that they can work again together. They are such attractive people, and are very good actors. I have finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good, and show good morals, and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies aren't cheesy.
578 0 What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days...<br /><br />This was something with a budget, but it just wasn't as much fun. <PERSON>John Astin</PERSON> of <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> Family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic, but he is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and unfunny gags.<br /><br />The plot. Dr. <PERSON>Gangrene</PERSON> (<PERSON>Astin</PERSON>) escapes from a French prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>... The hero, his French girlfriend and the Gizmo-like "Fuzzy Tomato" decide they are going to stop him...<br /><br />Forgettable Direct to Video nonsense...
579 1 I love all of the movies by <PERSON>Michael Landon Jr</PERSON>. And <PERSON>Michael Landon Jr</PERSON>'s casting of <PERSON>Dale Midkiff</PERSON> as "<PERSON>Clark Davis</PERSON>"could not of been any better. <PERSON>Dale Midkiff</PERSON> has the ways to pull off this character.<br /><br />This movie kept me spellbound from start to finish.<br /><br />The death of <ORGANIZATION>Missie & Willies</ORGANIZATION> baby girl with the timing of Clarks visit was only Gods timing. How they dealt with the death and how <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> helped them do so was that of a fathers love.<br /><br />Although there are 3 movies before this one [ Love Comes Softly , Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I feel you can see this movie and understand it easily. Yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them.<br /><br /><PERSON>Michael Landon Jr.</PERSON> is an excellent director<br /><br />I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
580 0 Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you either love it or hate it. I personally like it, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone. The tomatoes aren't the same, jokes are lame, even the actors aren't as funny. Because that's the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be - funny.<br /><br />So now following the plot made to laugh, is annoying. They really shouldn't have done the fourth part to the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
581 1 <PERSON>Edmund Burke</PERSON> said that "all evil needs is for good me to do nothing." <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films. This movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith. It had no violence, no lewdness, and did not deserve a PG rating. The western scenery was filmed well, and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking. Actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise believable and talented. Music score was too loud, and in some places drowned out the dialog completely. I'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Sometimes the good guys do win, and they win by honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message, and would recommend it for the entire family.
582 0 Film version of <PERSON>Sandra Bernhard</PERSON>'s one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. <PERSON>Sandra</PERSON> spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker <PERSON>Nicolas Roeg</PERSON> served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have his chilly, detached signature style all over it. <PERSON>Bernhard</PERSON> co-wrote the show with director <PERSON>John Boskovich</PERSON>; their oddest touch was in having all of <PERSON>Sandra</PERSON>'s in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from ****
583 1 Zombie Chronicles isn't something to shout about, it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by <PERSON>Brad Sykes</PERSON> who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the gore is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. <ORGANIZATION>Zombie Chronicles</ORGANIZATION> is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there, if you love low budget B-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles.
584 0 I saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as I thought <PERSON>Sandra</PERSON> was quite funny from what I remembered. The only facial movement I had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie I just suffered through.<br /><br />The person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line, just one scene, that is even worth a chuckle.<br /><br />She is a much better singer than I remember her to be, but I didn't want to watch a lounge act.<br /><br />I think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively.
585 1 Okay, first of all I got this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3D. It is for the most part, but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that hard to film in a car!!! SECOND - The story isn't very good. There are a lot of things wrong with it.<br /><br />THIRD - Why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! It made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! Watch it for a good laugh , but don't waste your time buying it. Just download it or something for cheap.
586 0 This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> for a vacation. On their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on. The girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved. She becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened. The other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell. The deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene I admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song" with <PERSON>Frankie Avalon</PERSON> staring in it, the same motive just a different character part. It's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80's low-budget movie and the ending was the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back!
587 1 What could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on? And most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal.<br /><br />But the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind the unreal lines. And the directing is wonderful. Each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long.<br /><br />I showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because I was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie. The friends enjoyed it too.
588 0 SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO. (I'm leaning toward rip off.) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the "Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks" genre because it is actually shot in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>.<br /><br />A group of college girls head to <LOCATION>Ft. Lauderdale</LOCATION> for summer vacation and are waylaid in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (Note to <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>: stay on the highway when you go to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.) <PERSON>Sue Ellen</PERSON> (<PERSON>Lisa Stahl</PERSON>) has to pee so she heads into the woods. When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (Tony March) strangle his mistress (<PERSON>Merry Rozelle</PERSON>) to death. (Note to <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>: do not wander off into the woods when in the South; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) This is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good.<br /><br />While <PERSON>Tony March</PERSON> will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his <PERSON>Sheriff Dean</PERSON> becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. <PERSON>Tom Law</PERSON> is likable as Deputy <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I've seen since <PERSON>Walton Goggins</PERSON> (Deputy <PERSON>Steve Naish</PERSON>) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.<br /><br />A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. The girls stop at a BBQ in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. Sue <PERSON>Ellen</PERSON> runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her.<br /><br />And in the strangest scene, <PERSON>Sheriff Dean</PERSON> makes like he's about to rape <PERSON>Patty</PERSON> (<PERSON>Carol Cadby</PERSON>) and tells her to take off her clothes. <PERSON>Dean</PERSON> has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how <PERSON>Jezebel</PERSON> is saved by the blood of <PERSON>Jesus Christ</PERSON>. I feel sorry for this preacher's flock. <PERSON>Jezebel</PERSON> was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven.
589 1 A critical and financial flop when first release, the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the Director's best. A <PERSON>La Ronde</PERSON> like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency (<PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Blaine Novak</PERSON>) persue, fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film (<PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patti Hansen</PERSON>). Much of the script was ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel. <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON> is excellent as the head detective persuing <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> after dropping singer <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON> and seeing cab-driver <PERSON>Patti Hansen</PERSON> on the side. <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> ineptly follows <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> and immediately falls in love with her. <PERSON>Blaine Novak</PERSON> has a few girls he is chasing (including <PERSON>Joyce Hyser</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elizabeth Pena</PERSON>). This film has some great performances by a supurb cast. Standouts are <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> (she doesn't have a line in the first half of the film). <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON> has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead) and <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON> has one of her best roles as the manic country singer <PERSON>Christy Miller</PERSON>. She is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat-a-tat-tat delivery. Highly Recommended! ********* stars!
590 0 I got this movie because I worked at a movie store so I got free rentals. It came in, and the cover made it look alright. Hot chick, carrying a weapon, alright, I'll check it out.<br /><br />Oh man, bad move. This was so horrible, I spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity.<br /><br />Cheesy dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuses of characters. I feel bad putting this movie down, because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but so was "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise.<br /><br />2/10.
591 1 <PERSON>Bogdonovich</PERSON>'s (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other. A film that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> locations and "true" geography, perhaps the best location filming in NYC I've ever seen. <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> reminds us that with good directors (<PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>, <PERSON>Blake Edwards</PERSON>, <PERSON>Billy Bob</PERSON>) he can be brilliant, and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with `em. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>'s fertile after- "success" career, when his best work was truly done ("saint jack", "at long last...", "noises off".
592 0 Despite the high ratings given to this film by <ORGANIZATION>IMDB</ORGANIZATION> users, this is nothing more than your typical girl-with-a-bad-childhood-obsessively-stalks-married-man film. The attractive <PERSON>Justine Priestly</PERSON>'s brief nude scenes may attract voyeurs, but the film is hackneyed tripe.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
593 1 Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty. And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of. If not his best, it's my most loved of all <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> movies.<br /><br />This unique masterpiece remind us, as most of the other films from the director, what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. As the song from whom the films takes its title (<PERSON>Gershwin</PERSON>'s well known composition) the film makes the impossible true, and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed upon the looks and views of the characters --with that "<PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> touch" based on the point-of-view-- is a class on Cinema Language, something that P.B. learned well from his admired directors from the Golden Age of the Movies). With a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of <PERSON>Sinatra</PERSON>'s "Trilogy"), this movie, full of self-consciousness and compassion, and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics wrote), deserves a better place on the <ORGANIZATION>History of American Cinema</ORGANIZATION> than where it have been placed. It's not "long on style, short on substance": it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
594 0 For the record, this film is intriguing but its hardly original. Back in 1998 a movie starring <PERSON>Talia Shire</PERSON> called The Landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters.<br /><br />The story is <PERSON>Amanda Lear</PERSON> has had a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, mental homes, etc. She's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor...who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy. (now THAT was original) The doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After moving in she falls in love with a stud named <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>, who just happens to be married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> (including a roadie).<br /><br />Much of the idea's came from the previous movie, same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in, same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, same flying a bodypress. It did have some original material, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the movie was <PERSON>Amanda</PERSON>'s beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene. Somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time.<br /><br />4 out of 10
595 1 I am glad other people enjoyed this movie, cause I know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office. I thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> directs with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially <PERSON>Coleen Camp</PERSON>) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple never looked better on film. You've seen worse movies!
596 0 <PERSON>Daraar</PERSON> got off to a pretty good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. All the first half of the movie is about is <PERSON>Rishi Kapoor</PERSON> falling head over heels in love with <PERSON>Juhi Chawla</PERSON>. By the way, don't you think he's a little old for her???<br /><br />Things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when <PERSON>Juhi</PERSON> tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a lunatic is he! He was an over-protective, neat-freak with a really HOT TEMPER! He used to beat up poor <PERSON>Juhi</PERSON> for no good reason! One of the reasons I really don't like this movie is because I can't stand to see <PERSON>Juhi</PERSON> (my favorite actress) get so abused. This film in general has WAY too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so sickening!!!<br /><br />Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting <PERSON>Daraar</PERSON>, you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else!
597 1 <ORGANIZATION>New York</ORGANIZATION> has never looked so good! And neither has anyone in this movie. While the script is a bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it. You almost wish people like this really existed. The appeal of the actors are what really put it over(<PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON> and the late <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> are particularly good.) Go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did.
598 0 This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENIEMY After YAARANA(1995) and AGNISAKSHI(1996)<br /><br />AGNISAKSHI was the only one which worked and was a better film<br /><br />DARAAR is directed by <PERSON>Abbas Mustan</PERSON> who sadly failed in their attempt here<br /><br />the story was good but the handling wasn't that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing<br /><br />Direction is bad Music is good<br /><br /><PERSON>Rishi</PERSON> reprises his role of YAARANA(strangely which also was a remake of SWTE) and looks too fat for the lead and is okay <PERSON>Juhi</PERSON> is decent while <PERSON>Arbaaz</PERSON> tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible <PERSON>Johny</PERSON> is too loud
599 1 <PERSON>Peter Bogdonavich</PERSON> has made a handful of truly great films, and THEY ALL LAUGHED is one of his best. The cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy. Interestingly enough, the witty, light touch <PERSON>Bogdonavich</PERSON> so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. There's no soundtrack music to cue us. We meet the characters in action, and as <PERSON>Bogdonavich</PERSON> glides down the streets of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the film unfolds effortlessly. <PERSON>Robby Muller</PERSON>'s camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't. The cast is terrific. In every way, a classic.
600 0 <PERSON>Robert Taylor</PERSON> definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western. It was one of the few times that <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> would play a heavy in a film. Nonetheless, this picture was far from great as shortly after this, <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> fled to television with the successful series The Detectives.<br /><br /><PERSON>Stuart Granger</PERSON> hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>'s partner. <br /><br /><PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows.<br /><br />Another very good performance here was by veteran actor <PERSON>Lloyd Nolan</PERSON> as an aged, drinking old-timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well. In his early scenes, <PERSON>Nolan</PERSON> was really doing an excellent take-off of <PERSON>Walter Huston</PERSON> in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the <PERSON>Sierre Madre</PERSON> in 1948. Note the appearance of <PERSON>Russ Tamblyn</PERSON> in the film. The following year <LOCATION>Tamblyn</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Nolan</PERSON> would join in the phenomenal <LOCATION>Peyton Place</LOCATION>.<br /><br />The writing in the film is stiff at best. By the film's end, it's the elements of nature that did <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> in. How about the elements of the writing here?
601 1 With various Bogdanoviches and <PERSON>Gazzaras</PERSON> scattered throughout cast and crew "They all laughed" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug "in - joke" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr <PERSON>Gazzara</PERSON> concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>'s triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from "Targets" onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally "Who the hell's in it?", recently remaindered in <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> bookstores. The soundtrack to "They all laughed" varies from <PERSON>Louis Armstrong</PERSON>'s 1947 <LOCATION>New York Town Hall</LOCATION> concert to <PERSON>Sinatra</PERSON> to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr B,s "Golden Boy" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes "They all laughed" will be recognised for the fine work that it is.
602 0 This is the worst documentary to come out of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> ever!!!! I'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie. All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching. I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year's Toronto Film Festival. Please never see this film.
603 1 'They All Laughed' is a superb <PERSON>Peter Bogdanovich</PERSON> that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why? their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the appealing star turns from <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON>, and the late <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> who is superb. and of course no classic is complete without <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>. the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties, film is essentially about the Odyssey detective agency which is run by <PERSON>Gazzara</PERSON> who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric <PERSON>Blaine Novak</PERSON>(the films co-producer) and <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON>, basically the <PERSON>Gazzara</PERSON> falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife(<PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> falls for beautiful <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> who sadly murdered infamously after production, 'They All Laughed is essential viewing for <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> fans.
604 0 I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. Not that I like spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie.<br /><br />Anyways, it's pretty boring aside from a scene with <PERSON>Roger Ebert</PERSON> in it. There really isn't too many celebrities in this movie, and most don't seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny (it comes for free on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Papel Chase.
605 1 This movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world. <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "<PERSON>Sam</PERSON>" hits close to home, is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with. <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON> was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I've met <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> in my travels somewhere. All around, an excellent choice to pick up any evening.!:-)
606 0 It's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie. Not that I haven't tried, mind you - but I sit down, and I pop in the aged VHS, and I watch the opening...and suddenly I'm five years old again and clutching my very own Care Bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart.<br /><br />I can see, objectively, that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby merchandising-mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old goes, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - I'd only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR those lovably cynical Gen-X/Y-ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad/strange (a category in which this movie...definitely belongs). To those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment: You might want to keep looking.
607 1 Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 favorites. The blurb I wrote for <ORGANIZATION>Amazon</ORGANIZATION> is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its appeal - "Thank you to the people of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> on whose island this was filmed." A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (<PERSON>Peter Bogdanovich</PERSON> is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the <LOCATION>Ansonia</LOCATION>, the old <ORGANIZATION>FAO Schwartz</ORGANIZATION>, the Plaza, the Roxy, <PERSON>Chez Brigitte</PERSON>, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, it was also <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON>'s last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love.
608 0 This movie portrays <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> as a womanizing, hard drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in. Babe Ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film. Also, <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON> was barely covered and this was a well know relationship, good bad or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than all bad. He was an American hero, an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after. I feel that I am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored. Shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness.
609 1 I watched it some years ago. I remembered it as very mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholic things, like the fate of <PERSON>Dorothy</PERSON> and the personal future of <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON>.<br /><br />I turn to watch on my VHS copy and then I was reviewing it more and more. Nowadays I am waiting for the DVD version, at any price, please!<br /><br />The country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second, a bit of blueish, but also happy.<br /><br />All the characters are great to me, with funny situations, great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people I met on the Internet or cinema clubs. This may not be casualty.<br /><br />I think that the title is a hope about life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible<br /><br />I know that this may be a particular comment for the movie, but the fact is that I like it very much, I think that movie marked me and I will never forget it.
610 0 I'm glad that I saw this film after Mr.Sandler became famous.<br /><br />It is bad....bad,bad,bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painfully dull home movie.<br /><br />I really enjoy his other films......but if you're a fan like me....stay away from this one. It may change your thoughts on <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>. You may never recover from the horror that is this film....I've had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home.......
611 1 Screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Peter Bogdanovich</PERSON> is obviously in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet <PERSON>Audrey Hepburn</PERSON> is (naturally) put a notch above the others because, after all, she's the princess <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior. He shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON>, and allows her room to sparkle throughout. The love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though I did tire of <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON>'s TV-styled klutziness. <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON>, and the grounded, earthy-sensual <PERSON>Patti Hansen</PERSON> are all exciting to watch. But it's really <PERSON>Hepburn</PERSON>'s valentine and she absolutely glows. *** from ****
612 0 Unwatchable. You can't even make it past the first three minutes. And this is coming from a huge <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> fan!!1
613 1 Well, I had seen "They all laughed" when it came out in<br /><br /><LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. I 've just seen it again on tape, almost twenty years after... <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing, too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do, at times. Go get it.
614 0 ...okay, maybe not all of it. Lured by the false promise of bikini-clad women on the movie's cover...but the HORROR...THE HORROR... ...whatever you do, do NOT watch this movie. Gouge out your eyes, repeatedly bash your skull in...do what it takes. Never again--never forget!<br /><br />
615 1 "They All Laughed" is one of those little movies I am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much. <PERSON>Bogdanovich</PERSON> wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth. But, that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and "TAL" is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale. It is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast: <PERSON>Colleen Camp</PERSON>'s simultaneously shouting orders at <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> and her dog; <PERSON>Blaine Novak</PERSON> unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment <PERSON>Dorothy Stratten</PERSON> falls for <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> and says, "How...weird." It's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face.
616 0 Mere thoughts of "Going Overboard" (aka "Babes Ahoy") make me want to weep. Throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie. It's not even a supposed "so bad it's good" movie. I would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it. Oh the pain, the pain...
617 1 First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. Overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>. I watch I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very, very sad.<br /><br />Anyway, what was shown here in <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played <PERSON>Viv Vance</PERSON> - not great casting at all. And the switch from <PERSON>Madeline Zima</PERSON> to <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON>.... uhhh, like <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> & <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>. No, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said, this focused mainly just on <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> & <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>. Had there been more time, had the story been more about <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of <ORGANIZATION>Gable & Lombard</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Red Skelton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buster Keaton</PERSON> very briefly instead. Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well, for the most part. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> but isn't an enormous <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> fan, this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B
618 0 Hello. I am <PERSON>Paul Raddick</PERSON>, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON>'s film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by <PERSON>Sawtooth</PERSON>, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, <PERSON>Billy Madison</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jen Leone</PERSON>'s favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, <PERSON>Drew Barrymore</PERSON> was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain't <PERSON>Dooley</PERSON> squat! End of file.
619 1 Before I watched this tv movie I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After watching it, I realized how sad <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>'s life really was. It had it's great moments too, but I didn't realize how sad it was. This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> very well. I highly reccommend it.
620 0 I had never heard of this <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> movie until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster. Being an <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> fan at the time, I rented it. HONESTLY I could only watch about 30 mins. of it. It was TERRIBLE. Do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public. I honestly hope this movie goes OOP soon, and I hope it STAYS THAT WAY!
621 1 Dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary in retelling any life story. In the case of "Lucy", the main points of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>'s teenage years, early career and 20 year marriage to <PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON> are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way.<br /><br />The main emotional points of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s life are made clear: <PERSON>Lucille</PERSON>'s struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character <PERSON>Lucy Ricardo</PERSON> a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to <PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON>; <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> & <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as TV's most memorable sitcom couple.<br /><br />As <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON> does a commendable job. Do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one <PERSON>Judy Davis</PERSON> made when playing <PERSON>Judy Garland</PERSON>, but <PERSON>York</PERSON> makes Ball strong-willed yet likable, and is very funny in her own right. Even though her comedic-timing is different than <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s, she is still believable. The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set, and her mistreatment of <PERSON>Vivian Vance</PERSON> during the early "I Love Lucy" years, but watching York portray <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.<br /><br /><PERSON>Daniel Pino</PERSON> is thinner and less charismatic than the real <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> was, but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>'s accent, especially in the opening scene. <PERSON>Madeline Zima</PERSON> was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen-aged <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Vivian Vance</PERSON> and <PERSON>William Frawley</PERSON> were not featured much, thankfully, since <PERSON>Rebecca Hobbs</PERSON> and <PERSON>Russell Newman</PERSON> were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they aren't good actors in their own right, they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. Most of the actors were from <LOCATION>Austrailia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zeland</LOCATION>, and the repressed accents are detectable at times.<br /><br />Although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. <PERSON>Jess Oppenheimer</PERSON>, the head writer of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s radio show "My Favourite Husband" which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with "I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>" in 1951, completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! This movie also depicts <PERSON>Marc Daniels</PERSON> as being the main "I Love Lucy" director for its entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by <PERSON>William Asher</PERSON> after the first season! Also, though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the <PERSON>Ricardo</PERSON>'s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well. The <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> home looks pretty close to the original, except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. <br /><br />There's also <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> talking about buying RKO in 1953, during <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s red-scare incident, even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to <ORGANIZATION>Oppenheimer</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Asher</PERSON>, two vital figures in "I Love Lucy" history? The biggest gaff comes in the "I Love Lucy" recreation scenes, at least a few of them. It's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated, and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! The "We're Having A Baby" number was shortened as well, but other than that it was practically dead on. By far the best was the "grape-stomping" scene, with <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON> really nailing <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s mannerisms. The producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the "Vitametavegamin" and candy factory bits, instead showing the actors rehearse them. These scenes proved effective because of that approach.<br /><br />The film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. Overall, though, it gives a decent portrait of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> & <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>'s marriage, and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.
622 0 I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> could not find a better project than this? As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell!! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. Did <PERSON>Wallmart</PERSON> get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore!!
623 1 I thought <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON> was fantastic as "<PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>." I have seen her in "Kiss Me, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>" and "Victor/Victoria," as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON>'s performance in "<PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>." Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. So many people have focused on the fact that <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> doesn't really look like <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>. My response to that is, "So what?" I wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> certainly gave us that, in great depth. I also didn't want to see someone simply "doing" classic <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> routines. Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> portray <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The <ORGANIZATION>Candy Factory</ORGANIZATION>. (It seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. I also thought <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping, in particular. There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON>'s mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> having. I couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> of "I Love Lucy" throughout the entire movie. After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> was really like in her early movie years. I think <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />I believe that <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon. And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. "Lucy" was a star turn for <PERSON>Rachel York</PERSON>. I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. I also hope it brings her an Emmy.
624 0 If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it! If you haven't, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst. So, if you're REALLY bored, go rent it. If you want to know what it's like, here's my little summary: <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is.
625 1 Based on a true story, this series is a gem within its kind. The slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village.<br /><br />In the diamond mining town of <LOCATION>Tijuco</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, the diamond commender--appointed by the king of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>--is the ultimate authority. Having grown up in the relative security of his house, the young and beautiful <PERSON>Xica da Silva</PERSON> finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter. In a desperate bid to save herself, <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king, intending to use them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day, however, and when the loot turns up missing, the diamond commender is led away in chains, his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs. <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, the diamond commender's son, swears vengeance. <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> and the other slaves, however, are sold at auction, and <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> ends up in the home of the Sergeant Major, an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust. To the town of <LOCATION>Tijuco</LOCATION>, however, comes the new diamond commender, the elegant and ruthless <PERSON>Joao Fernandes</PERSON>. Immediately struck by <PERSON>Xica</PERSON>'s beauty, he manipulates the Sergeant Major into selling her to him. And thus begins a love story, filled with danger, intrigue and passion, between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen.<br /><br />The series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute. At times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
626 0 This is definitely the worst movie <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>'s ever done but at this point in his life, he was just happy to have a movie. There are 3 or 4 laughs in it but I used the fast forward button through some of it. Don't waste your time. I only saw it because I wanted to see all of his movies, but it sucked.
627 1 I am Black American and I loved this soap opera. I watched it dubbed in Spanish on <ORGANIZATION>Telemundo</ORGANIZATION>, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a TRUE story about a black slave who's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid, whimsical way of living.<br /><br />A lot of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. Many would argue that she sold herself out - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children.<br /><br />It was such an excellent soap opera, that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it's not being released. This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER. We need for it to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. It's playing on <LOCATION>Azteca America</LOCATION> right now, which is only available in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> by paid cable. We need it released again to <ORGANIZATION>Telemundo</ORGANIZATION>.
628 0 I picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store, <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. There was absolutely no story line at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Word" every other word he said,cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top. And even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie, it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions. And last of all is when they would randomly put in Bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie. In my opinion, Don't buy this movie, its a waste of money
629 1 This show is a great history story. It's has everything from slavery,the way they were treated, religion, the ways Jews were sent into hiding,the inquisition, the belief in the Orisha the African gods, the way women were treated,including the daughters. Even down to homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined and that <PERSON>Violante</PERSON>, that character saddens me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.I am so glad they decided to re-release it to t.v. again. Although I would love to see the unedited version. <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> has become my Heroine. I look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it. I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I look forward to my <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> every night. It would be great to dub it in English so the Americans can love her too.
630 0 Watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON>. Truly a slow and painful death.<br /><br />'Bought the DVD in the $5.88 bin at <ORGANIZATION>Wal Mart</ORGANIZATION>. But the thought that keeps echoing in my head is, "How can I get my money back?"<br /><br />The most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat JUST DOES NOT SINK!<br /><br />Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theatre. You know that show on the <ORGANIZATION>SciFi Channel</ORGANIZATION> in which some guy and his muppet-machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks (Mystery Science Theatre). IMMEDIATELY, spin off a comedy program and feature this flick. Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear that viewers may actually begin following <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> with ice picks and chainsaws.<br /><br />
631 1 I absolutely LOVED this Soap. It has been one of my favorite. Will highly recommend :)... I just love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. I'm really sad that the soap ended but I'm sure I'll be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains. The only thing I would have changed is the end for <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> and her long life love. I can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it. <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> has been by far, the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :)GO XICA.. Hope you all like it as well.
632 0 This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays <PERSON>Lars</PERSON> in heavyweights than don't make the damn film. I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS of a movie. Adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> and willingly putting your dick in a blender. Anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I'd give it to the support <PERSON>Lorraina Bobbitt</PERSON> foundation before buying this movie.
633 1 xica <PERSON>da Silva</PERSON> is one of the best Brazilians opera soap ever! the a black slave's story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful man's of the area love, in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, that explored its diamonds. The largest xica enemy, violante, bride that it was changed by xica, is a woman of big it influences the <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything. Very religious person, she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time, she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica, that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area. The story also bill with forbidden loves, sorceries and vampires and religious fervor. <PERSON>Xica da Silva</PERSON> does with that you don't want to lose a I only surrender, from beginning to end!
634 0 This HAS to be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie. The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock -- they must have got it from the $1 store or something.<br /><br />If you like <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON>, this is nothing like any other movie he's made. This started with a bad premise and then just got worse. There's nothing even remotely funny in it.<br /><br />I've watched a lot of movies, including some I didn't care for. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.
635 1 <ORGANIZATION>Telemundo</ORGANIZATION> should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the novela Xica! I know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela Xica! It is a very entertaining novela which is set in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of that time period. I wish <ORGANIZATION>Telemundo</ORGANIZATION> would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend watching Xica if it is ever shown again on <ORGANIZATION>Telemundo</ORGANIZATION>. I've e-mailed <ORGANIZATION>Telemundo</ORGANIZATION> a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The only cautionary statement about <PERSON>Xica</PERSON> is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica. Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10!
636 0 I stole this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON>, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny." Wrong! I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of <PERSON>Steven</PERSON> segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this.
637 1 This is without a doubt the greatest film ever made. It is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on. The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests one enters by mail, and a host of other innovations. Besides, what other movies have cameos by <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jr</PERSON>? To decipher the film, hunt down the director's book entitled I Was Curious. It'll all become clear. It's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. A triumph. Now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color *other* than white...the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible.
638 0 A friend of mine bought this film for Â£1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Billy Bob Thornton</PERSON> and the incredibly talented <PERSON>Burt Young</PERSON>, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.<br /><br /><PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named '<PERSON>Dickie</PERSON>' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON>'s character <PERSON>Shecker</PERSON> gets his big break. <PERSON>Dickie</PERSON> is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.<br /><br />Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.
639 1 Wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question: what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary.
640 0 With <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON>.<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about cruise ship waiter <PERSON>Shecky</PERSON> (Sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is <PERSON>Billy Bob Thornton</PERSON>. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.<br /><br />86 mins. rated R for Language.
641 1 I am Curious (Yellow) (a film, in near Seussical rhyme, is said right at the start to be available in two versions, Yellow and Blue) was one of those big art-house hits that first was a major sensation in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> then a big scandal/cause-celebre in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>. What's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what's revealed in the sex or nudity- the director/"actor" <PERSON>Vilgot Sjoman</PERSON> films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it's always more-so an intellectual expression than very lust-like- but the daring of the attempt at a pure 'metafilm' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. Who knew such things in a generally peaceful country (i.e. usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars) could be so heated-up politically? At least, that's part of <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON>'s aim here. <br /><br />Like a filmmaker such as <PERSON>Dusan Makavajev</PERSON> with some of his works like W.R. (if not as surreal and deranged) or to a slightly lesser extent <PERSON>Bertolucci</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> is out to mix politics and sex (mostly politics and social strata) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film. The two characters, <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> and <PERSON>Borje</PERSON>, have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film, where <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> is a "curious" socialist-wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and 'trains' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one, while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend. And as this is going on, which is by itself enough for one movie, <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film (there's even a great bit midway through where, as if at a rock concert, title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are, negating having to use end credits!) Then with this there's a whole other dynamic as <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> gives an actual performance, not just a "hey, I'm the director playing the director" bit.<br /><br />At first, one might not get this structure and that I am Curious (Yellow) is just a film where <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class, socialism, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>, and once in a while we see <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>'s father or Bjore. But <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative, documentary, film-within-a-film, and even a serious interview with <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>, who also acts as a quasi-guru for <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>. It might not always be completely coherent analysis politically, but it doesn't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a Godard picture; the satire <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> is after is akin to a <PERSON>Godard</PERSON> but on a whole other wavelength. His anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer.<br /><br />If I Am Curious (Yellow) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full-blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors, it isn't entirely successful, I think, as an emotional experience. Where <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> had it down to a T with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies, <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors. Occasionally it works if only for the actors, <PERSON>Lena Nyman</PERSON> (mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even) and <PERSON>Borje Ahlstedt</PERSON> (a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>), but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner-film of <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> and <PERSON>Borje</PERSON> since (perhaps intentionally) <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> fills it up with clichÃ©s (<PERSON>Borje</PERSON> has a girlfriend and kid, will he leave her, how will <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> reconcile her father) and a heavy-handed narration from his starlet of sorts.<br /><br />And yet, for whatever faults <PERSON>Sjoman</PERSON> may have, ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself, I Am Curious (Yellow) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in Swedish cinema, or testing what couldn't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage. I'd even go as far as to say it's influential, and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time (a specific technique used, with the film rewinding towards the end, is echoed in poorer usage in Funny Games), and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant-garde or meta-film-making. If it's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as W.R. or Last Tango, it's close behind.
642 0 <ORGANIZATION>Shecky</ORGANIZATION>, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a <ORGANIZATION>UK HiFi & Video</ORGANIZATION> retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send <PERSON>Shecky</PERSON> back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin?<br /><br /><PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON>, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with <PERSON>Billy Zane</PERSON>? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable <PERSON>Shecky Moskowitz</PERSON>' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> has come, and just how low he can go.
643 1 I don't know how or why this film has a meager rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I am Curious: Blue" is a masterwork.<br /><br />The only thing that will let you down in this film is if you don't like the process of film, don't like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramming.<br /><br />This isn't a film that you will want to watch to unwind; it's a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care.<br /><br />******SUMMARIES, MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO*******<br /><br />The main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film, within a film thing, but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions aren't real.<br /><br />The film is like many films in one:<br /><br />1. A political documentary, about the social system in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> at the time. Which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today. Interviews done by a young woman named <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>.<br /><br />2. A narrative about a filmmaker, <PERSON>Vilgot Sjoman</PERSON>, making a film... he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people he's supposed to work with.<br /><br />3. The film that <PERSON>Vilgot</PERSON> is making. It's about a young woman named <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>(IE. #2), who is young and very politically active, she is making a documentary (IE. #1.). She is also a coming of age and into her sexuality, and the freedom of that.<br /><br />The magnificence and sheer brilliance of "I am Curious: Yellow/Blue" is how these three elements are cut together. In one moment you are watching an interview about politics, and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative.<br /><br />Another thing is the dynamic between "Yellow" and "Blue", which if you see one, you must see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I'll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge, no other films have done it though it is a great technique.<br /><br />Think of "Yellow" as a living thing, actual events in 14 scenes. A complete tale.<br /><br />Think of "Blue" as all the things IN BETWEEN the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you didn't see, that is a complete tale on it's own.<br /><br />Essentially they are parallel films... the same story, told in two different ways.<br /><br />It wasn't until i saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that i fully understood "Yellow"<br /><br />I hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences, because this film changed the way i looked at film.<br /><br />thanks for your time.
644 0 I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I didn't believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> haters. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />What we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplish. You'd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. But no, it's just horrible. It's not "so bad it's good", its just bad. You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.<br /><br />Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.<br /><br />You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. Don't. Please don't. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those that think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it.
645 1 this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.<br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend this film, as it's issues are still widely available. it's funny, the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions.<br /><br />i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
646 0 This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else. There was no plot and no point. I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
647 1 This is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by any fan of French New Wave or Underground film. There are barely opening or closing credits--we are just dropped into the world of consumerist art, revolution, and youth. This film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality. Lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary, but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing, not for describing the real.
648 0 Worst mistake of my life.<br /><br />I picked this movie up at Target for $5 because I figured, "Hey, it's Sandler I can get some cheap laughs". I was wrong, completely wrong. Mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then I'd stop, and you know why? Because it felt damn good. Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, <ORGANIZATION>Army of Darkness</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Kill Bill</PERSON> just to get over that crap. I HATE YOU SANDLER FOR ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS AND RUINING A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
649 1 I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. I got it simply because I saw it on the list of Top 25 Most Controversial Films of All Time. It didn't look particularly great. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory.<br /><br />It's about a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. She stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive. She experiments with experience in sex, political activism, and human relationships. Meanwhile, film's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other. Nudity, explicit sex, and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> while its seizure by <ORGANIZATION>Customs</ORGANIZATION> was appealed. The film is a narrative yet it's a documentary that shows us the behind-the- scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative, the fourth wall being broken. This film is the most direct possible way of making a movie I have ever seen. The movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goings-on, freedom-fighting and sexual liberation. I like to think of it as much more than that.<br /><br />I didn't think I would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I actually really do. This film is a buried treasure. Give it a try.
650 0 Having decided some time ago to collect the films of <PERSON>Billy Bob Thornton</PERSON> (on the strength of class movies like "Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Wasn't There" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "The big stinking man", "The big stinking man who?", "The big stinking man - is YOU!". Yes folks, it really is that bad. <PERSON>Billy Bob</PERSON> is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like "The Fast and the Furious" and not a "no-budget" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push.
651 1 This is a great film - esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today's politically-minded filmmakers. A film that can so easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. While the bouyant optimism of the 1960's can't be regained, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's breezy energy and charm. I don't know what those who label the film "boring" were watching - there's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time.
652 0 This early <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny <PERSON>Billy Maddison</PERSON>. Unfortunately, <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the film's "jokes" come from <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON>'s career. Pass this one up at the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
653 1 "Jag Ã¤r nyfiken Â– Yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, explorative. Don't expect <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> here. This movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and about the issues, read *contradictions*, that the nation and the world were facing. At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary, with <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>, the main character, and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e.g. <PERSON>Olaf Palme</PERSON> at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>'s life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person Â– complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, SjÃ¶man, and his crew documenting themselves documenting <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. I am reminded of a Bjork music video with this same quality Â– a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish. I think SjÃ¶man may have had something similar in mind. While "Jag Ã¤r nyfiken Â– Yellow" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic.
654 0 Even if you're a huge <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON>'s career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a "movie"! <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is "no-budget" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON> finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic <PERSON>Henny Youngman</PERSON> line "Take my wife, please" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, <PERSON>Sandler</PERSON>'s current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in "<PERSON>Billy Madison</PERSON>," the midget in "Happy Gilmore's" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>'s early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in "Mixed Nuts." Of course, the <PERSON>Sandman</PERSON> is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. <PERSON>Billy Bob Thornton</PERSON> also makes a short appearance, <PERSON>Billy Zane</PERSON> ("Titanic") has a supporting role and the great <PERSON>Burt Young</PERSON> (from the "Rocky" movies) has a significant role. <br /><br />This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so. <br /><br />My score: 3 (out of 10)
655 1 I've read one comment which labeled this film "trash" and "a waste<br /><br />of time." I think this person got their political undies tugged a bit<br /><br />too much.<br /><br />I just rented the new Criterion DVD's of both Yellow and Blue.<br /><br />These films--although hardly great--have at least become of<br /><br />historical interest as to the so-called "radical student<br /><br />political-social movement"of the late '60s.<br /><br />I hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation, I<br /><br />was expecting some real porn (there isn't any.) There is frontal<br /><br />nudity (including the still verboten frontal male nudity (automatic<br /><br />NC-17--the Orwellian-X) in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. But I wasn't expecting the films<br /><br />in-your-face democratic socialist message.<br /><br /> Though it tends to the simplistic , I thought it occassionally made<br /><br />its points well. Both films occassionally had me laughing out loud<br /><br />and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of<br /><br />parody in the film. Especially the supposedly "pornographic" sex<br /><br />scenes. The first such scene is very realistic. The lead couple is<br /><br />clumsy, inept, funny and endearing in their first copulation scene.<br /><br />The second--which caused the most complaints--has faked<br /><br />cunnilingus and fellatio. And the last is the end of an angry fight,<br /><br />that is believable.<br /><br />The extras include an informative introduction to the film, an<br /><br />interview with the original American distributor and his attorney,<br /><br />excerpts from trial testimony in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and a "diary" commentary<br /><br />by the director on some scenes.<br /><br />This is the film that "blue noses" wouldn't let alone and led to the<br /><br />pivotal "prurient interest with no social redeeming value" standard<br /><br />that, thankfully, still stands.<br /><br />Those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must<br /><br />see.
656 0 I am a HUGE <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> fan, and one day I was looking at the Cast&Crew selection on one of his DVD's and saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see an <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> that didn't hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out. I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once. Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie EVER made,....EVER!
657 1 Fascinating I approached I Am Curious (Yellow) and it's companion piece with great trepidation. I'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex. What I got wasn't this, but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other. I sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was `lame' or `boring' approached the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps this is pornography, assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses, but it is intentionally un-erotic. <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>, the protagonist, throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring. Her breasts may be saggy, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat, and her face, chubby. But by the end of the film, the audience comes to identify with her, and accept her faults as human. This touch gives her even more believability out necessity. Had the director cast a Briget Bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified. I cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece. Be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film. The patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream.
658 0 First: I bought it at the video store. Second: I watched it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most of the antics were lame. And last, but not least: It's not only a bad movie, it's a total fiasco.<br /><br />I am a huge <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film. I pity it because it was his first movie. Even if you are a huge <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> fan, don't bother watching this movie. Instead, just take the video, board a yacht, and throw it overboard.
659 1 Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of <ORGANIZATION>Scylla & Charybdis</ORGANIZATION> and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes <PERSON>Odysseus</PERSON> in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece,not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick. Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if one is familiar with the storyline, he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand). At least I did, and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more.
660 0 I wanted to punch the TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. The terrorists are annoying. <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> is annoying. I normally like him but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating film in the world. The comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious. The only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls. It was so irritating I wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOY SOMEONE. If you even like <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> a little bit, Don't buy it. It will just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. Its a waste of the $1.99 I paid for it.
661 1 I'm Italian and when I've recently looked again this film I astonished for its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings. Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema (<PERSON>Pasolini</PERSON> etc.), by that time gone. <br /><br />The <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> epic films are good...for fun. Perhaps this 'Odyssey' had no English version because is not enough funny... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience. However suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections.<br /><br />In <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> was recently released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but it's Italian only, and without subtitles. Too bad: also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable.
662 0 I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> is an abomination as <PERSON>Schecky Moskowitz</PERSON>, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.<br /><br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be "at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard".
663 1 This movie of 370 minutes was aired by the Italian public television during the early seventies. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer of the Journey home of Odysseus after the Troy war. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, told at list 500 years after those events toke place, around 1100 BC.<br /><br />This is a 1969 movie, so if you buy the DVD version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than Italian, even the close caption is in Italian. Pity. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the English subtitles. But if this is not a problem for you, than I would strongly recommend to watch this movie.
664 0 I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it. I picked it up on a rainy day from <ORGANIZATION>WalMart</ORGANIZATION> like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay, who cares... <PERSON>Shecky Moskowitz</PERSON> is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood.<br /><br />Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says "Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in...."<br /><br />My response is always "Well now you can"<br /><br />
665 1 Although I have not seen this mini-series in over twenty years I can still remember how the balance between character,plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded. The use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story. The two versions I've seen were dubbed (English and French)but the actors appear to speak their own language not just Italian so there is a synchronization problem. It does not spoil the story telling. Among the cast <PERSON>Irene Pappas</PERSON> as <PERSON>Penelope</PERSON> is the most recognizable to North Americans. Recommended to all followers of <PERSON>Odysseus</PERSON>' ever returning.
666 0 I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and I`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON> so I guess this movie has something going for it<br /><br />It gets off to a bad start where Buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face . Bad guys enter the temple<br /><br />Child sits with blank expression<br /><br />Bad guys chop up the monks<br /><br />Child sits with blank expression<br /><br />Bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with ... Go on guess ? You do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD<br /><br />The title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . Not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . In fact that`s the main problem ( And boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . I blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too . Did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? It`s part fantasy , part martial arts , part buddy movie , part comedy and it`s all crap
667 1 In all honesty, this series is as much a classic (as television goes) as the original poem is to the world's literature. Far from being crassly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts.<br /><br />I was moved by the plight of <PERSON>Odysseus</PERSON> and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous CGI creatures flitting around on their ankle wings, or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis. As in Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary).<br /><br />It's a pity it's not available in DVD, especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the Odyssey that one can find in video stores.
668 0 Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example), and a real unfunny time. (<PERSON>Charles Dance</PERSON>) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (Last Action Hero). (<PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>) is doing a non-comic joking, and I heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! I'll never understand why or how ?! In one TV interview I've heard (<PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>) himself, when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! <br /><br />One of the comments said (Hey...It's the 1980s !). Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! <br /><br />There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (<PERSON>Charlotte Lewis</PERSON>) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! Anyhow the second reason is that I've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever!<br /><br />The bottom line: Bad movie, <PERSON>Greeeeeat</PERSON> legs.
669 1 It's very simple to qualify that movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of that epoch, 1100 B.C. They personalize perfectly the characters. A second reason is that the poetry expressed by <PERSON>Homere</PERSON> in his poem is well given by the production. Among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition. Third reason: the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect, in <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> regions, where the action of the poem occurred. And most of all, the emotion is on the rendezvous. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
670 0 <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loves kids. That didn't work (and why should it?), so instead we have <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON> out to save the world by rescuing "Kid Midas". I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> says or does can be best liked, but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie, and the same went for DR. <PERSON>DOLITTLE</PERSON>! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic, and that wouldn't have made any sense as <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s presidential fame. <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> is far better at COMING TO <LOCATION>AMERICA</LOCATION> and 48 HRS, but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste.
671 1 I've been trying to find out about this series for ages! Thank you, IMDb! I saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind. As a 6-year old, of course, I was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops, which was absolutely chilling (I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine, which I still have) What I also remember, though, was the atmosphere, which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious, austere, and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later I experienced that same sensation. It's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. Every 'Odyssey' I've seen since has been an enormous let-down. The characters in this series seemed genuine, real people - ancient Greek people - and not some <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> stars in costumes. This is a real masterpiece! But - Why is it not better known? And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD? I would just love to have the chance to see this again!
672 0 Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON> peaked, then started making dreadful <PERSON>Hal Needham</PERSON> car chase flicks. <PERSON>Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON> became the hottest property in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling Last Action Hero. And here, loquacious <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON> erases memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "family" adventure flick, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see <PERSON>Charlotte Lewis</PERSON>'s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film.<br /><br />The story is pure humdrum. It concerns social worker <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>, contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the Chosen One. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, classy actor <PERSON>Charles Dance</PERSON> looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>'s films, this is easily the worst. I've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> in an atypical role, in a non formulaic kind of film, and while both points are loosely true there's no forgiving the fact that the film - however atypical and non formulaic it might be - is an absolute load of garbage.<br /><br />
673 1 As it was already put, the best version ever of Homer's epic. Entirely shot in natural locations in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>. The sea and the sky are strikingly blue, the islands green and untouched. The clothing is linen, wool and fur, the settings stony and bare, everything is somewhat rugged and primitive, a bit what you would find in <PERSON>Cacoyannis</PERSON> or Pasolini movies, and it makes it all the more authentic. Although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural, it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century BC might have been like.<br /><br />The rhythm is somewhat slow and austere, but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it. Actually, it is amazingly close to the original plot by <PERSON>Homer</PERSON>, if not to the text itself. <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> doesn't appear until the first hour, the start being centered on his son looking after him. Then he suddenly appears lost in a storm, lands on the island of the Pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him. His adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts : the terrifying Cyclop, the magic world of Circe, the Underworld, the Sirens etc. He finally comes back to his homeland <LOCATION>Ithaca</LOCATION> after 20 years, and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse <PERSON>Penelope</PERSON>.<br /><br />As a story, the Odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life. The cast is brilliant and international here. <PERSON>Irene Papas</PERSON> gives us a typical Greek tragedy style performance as <PERSON>Penelope</PERSON>, but most amazing is the Albanian actor <PERSON>Bekim Fehmiu</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>. Really good looking and totally convincing, it seems the role was really made for him. Strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards. Also playing Nausicaa is <PERSON>Barbara Bach</PERSON> (as <PERSON>Barbara Gregorini</PERSON>) later famous as the <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> girl in "The Spy Who Loved Me", and playing <ORGANIZATION>Athena</ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON>Michele Breton</PERSON>, who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called "Performance" with <PERSON>Mick Jagger</PERSON>.<br /><br />As it was done 35 years ago, the series was actually quite an innovation for its time, as the first big European co-production for TV (<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>). I have seen this mini-series in 8 parts on French television as far back as 1974. I was a kid back then, and although it was all in black and white, it left a very vivid impression. All my life long I wondered if I would ever get a chance to see it again, as it was never shown on French TV later on.<br /><br />I recently found a copy on DVD (all in wonderful color) through Internet. It is unfortunately only in Italian with no subtitles, although French and German versions existed back then. I never heard there was any English version of this film as it is widely unknown in the <LOCATION>Anglo Saxon</LOCATION> world, and it's quite a shame. If you ever get a chance to watch this, you are not going to forget it ever.<br /><br />There were not many versions of the Odyssey before or after that. The one by <PERSON>Camerini</PERSON> in 1955 starring <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON> is a classic sword-and-sandal like "the 10 Commandments", but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story. The one in 1997 by <PERSON>Konchalovsky</PERSON> is a meretricious <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> movie, based on special effects, sometimes quite gory, very poorly acted and grossly afar from Homer's story and atmosphere.
674 0 Well, what's to say. THE GOLDEN CHILD falls in the category "so bad, it's good". <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON> is having some funny (and sometimes quite annoying lines), but you are still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain <PERSON>Sardo Numspa</PERSON> (what a f***ed up name is this??).<br /><br />Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD... hm... difficult to say, but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog.<br /><br />4 out of 10
675 1 Documenting a documenter. That's one way to describe Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale. This film follows anthropologist <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON>, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to <LOCATION>West Papua</LOCATION> and then <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> is a full-bodied character: a gay Jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for. Author of several books documenting his time with both the Asmat people of <LOCATION>West Papua</LOCATION> and the cannibalistic Amazonians in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become. Yet <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON>' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch. One can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.<br /><br /><PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. This film challenges the notions of morality and "naturalness"- e.g. nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism. (Watch for the graphic circumcision scene). When questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: "Why Not?" Who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? This little sleeper is a must watch for not only <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> types, but also those interested in the art of documentary making. This film shows what can be done shot on video. The editing provides a quiet revelation of <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON>' life that leaves you watching in fascination. At times, he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back, especially considering his age and physical frailty. We can be but grateful that <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> allowed the tables to be turned on himself, perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world. The filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance, presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests. That said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle. Move over <LOCATION>River Queen</LOCATION>, this is the best river ride I've taken in a while.
676 0 Definitely one of funny man <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>'s lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and a "Chosen One".<br /><br /><PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> is the "Chosen One" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". A finder of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (<PERSON>Charlotte Lewis</PERSON>) who tells him he is "The Chosen One", and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "The Golden Child". For if the child were to die, compassion would die with him, as he is the bearer of compassion.<br /><br />If all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now, it surely will once the movie begins. Suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film. Meant to be another vehicle for <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>'s egotistical brand of humour (the comedy isn't so great mind you), the movie fails on many levels. Even <PERSON>Charles Dance</PERSON> as the evil <PERSON>Sardo Numspa</PERSON> can't do much for proceedings. Very silly and disappointing.<br /><br />Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
677 1 I saw this film at <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>'s International Documentary Film Festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON>, all of whom are lively and outspoken New Yorkers. The film's title in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> was Keep the River on Your Right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship <PERSON>Tobias Schneebaum</PERSON> had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving. I can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.
678 0 Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "Big Trouble in <LOCATION>Little China</LOCATION>", or "Conan the Barbarian", which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is just plain bad.<br /><br />The premise itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. But here the <PERSON>Eddy Murphy</PERSON> "flip attitude" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mystic secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.<br /><br />Without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are faced by real danger, why should we care?<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- big fans of <PERSON>Eddy Murphy</PERSON> who can't help themselves<br /><br />-- I can't think of anyone else<br /><br />I'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
679 1 I read <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON>'s book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. This movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, <PERSON>Schneebaum</PERSON> himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.
680 0 I am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>. I think this was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop" so at the time he was hot. Considering that one made over two hundred million and it was R and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular. I have never been a big <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON> fan, so that is probably another reason I didn't care for it much at all. This one has <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> as some sort of finder of lost kids. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects. I had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers, <PERSON>Ray Harryhausen</PERSON> did better stuff. Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON>, unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" type scenes. I guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect, but to me it just did not work.
681 1 I loved This Movie. When I saw it on Febuary 3rd I knew I had to buy It!!! It comes out to buy on July 24th!!! It has cool deaths scenes, Hot girls, great cast, good story , good acting. Great Slasher Film. the Movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls. SEE this movies
682 0 Oh man. If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout, this is the movie to pop into the ol' VCR. The potential for cut-up lines in this film is just endless.<br /><br />(Minor spoilers ahead. Hey, do you really care if a film of this quality is "spoiled?") <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite-sex parent. But this girl seems to have one for her same-sex one, and I don't think there's a term for that. It might be because her mother <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> is played by <PERSON>Rosanna Arquette</PERSON>, whose cute overbite, neo-flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters. Here <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> is not only clueless to her daughter's conduct; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition. <br /><br />It's possible that <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> misses <PERSON>Traci</PERSON>'s murderous streak because truth be told, <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. It's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count.<br /><br />A particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON>, a Mexican maid who is described by <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> as around so long she's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say, "I just fell off the tomato truck from <LOCATION>Guadalajara</LOCATION>." <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> is so wise to <PERSON>Traci</PERSON>'s scheming, she might also wear a sign saying, "Hey, I'm the Next Victim!" Sure enough, <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> confronts <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> as <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> is making her way back from Mass, and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke. I rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire. <br /><br />In another sequence, <PERSON>Arquette</PERSON> wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard, under cloudy skies, talking to the owner. Cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies, talking to the owner's brother. Then cut to her wearing the first dress, in the first location, under cloudy skies - but it's supposed to be later. You get the picture. We're talking really bad directing.<br /><br />As for skin, don't expect much, although <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> does own a nice couple of bikinis. <br /><br />For those looking for a trash wallow, 8. For anybody else, 1/2.
683 1 I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. The cast was excellent, the plot was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! I would rate this as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls in it were really cute also, especially <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>. She was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some OOMPH!
684 0 This movie is so bad, I knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person. Very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie<br /><br />do yourself a favour and DON'T watch it 1/10
685 1 I gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely really about a 5.5..... Ummm.. it was kind of bloody, had likeable, shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets old.
686 0 A truly, truly dire Canadian-German co-production, the ever-wonderful <PERSON>Rosanna Arquette</PERSON> plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few uears prior to the "action" the child murdered her father, and mum took the fall for the offspring. Now she's moved up to the <LOCATION>Northwest US</LOCATION> to start over, but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother. So devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond.<br /><br />Unfortunately <PERSON>Mandy Schaeffer</PERSON> (as the daughter) murders more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie, though the incoherent script, useless direction and appalling music (check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini-clad bod) don't help any; we're supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails on both counts. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing (not to mention the fact that <PERSON>Arquette</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schaeffer</PERSON> don't really convince as mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss <PERSON>Arquette</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jurgen Prochnow</PERSON>, both of whom are worthy of far more than this, and both of whom (particularly <PERSON>Rosanna</PERSON>) are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago.<br /><br />One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three-hour "Love, Lies And Murder" (from Two Short Productions) has there been such a "You must be joking" credit.
687 1 <PERSON>Katherine Heigl</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>. Even before I knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me in. Gorgeous, talented and popular, these are performers to look out for.<br /><br />Ok, where do I start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago. His trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: well, take a pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality.<br /><br />Horror movies aren't supposed to be <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>, but I'm not gonna go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It's up there with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's mask is childishly creepy, and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky. The acting is topnotch: <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON> are a lot of fun. I really did wish to see much, much more of <PERSON>Katherine Heigl</PERSON>. I am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon. <PERSON>Jessica Capshaw</PERSON> is a very capable actress, and <PERSON>Jessica Cauffiel</PERSON> gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; <PERSON>Hedy Buress</PERSON> was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> looked frightfully like her.<br /><br />Highlights: Every death scene had a particular distinction to it. The creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue. The hottub scene, while ludicrous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was sinister. The soundtrack is great, with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes.<br /><br />Lowpoint: I felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough, we barely saw the mask, and it wasn't featured at all during the climax. I also thought the climax was really unfocused, but fun nonetheless.<br /><br />The twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise, but I'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine.<br /><br />I don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing, then <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION> would be it.<br /><br />My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
688 0 Let me be really clear about this movie. I didn't watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for the saucy sex scenes. That being said, this movie is so god damn awful I flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mandy Schaffer</PERSON>) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie already had me cringing.. you see a woman painting something by the lakeside, in pure bliss and serene, then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her. When they both finished, they show each other what they had done... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN SHE IS FACING INFRONT OF THE LAKE. What kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake?? And in another scene, <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> gets to kill her teacher's lover by smash him with the sail pole, and then she swims away, and none of the town's police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? <PERSON>MANDY</PERSON> DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE DID SHE? HER FINGER PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE GOD DAMN BOAT!! After that, it gets worst, whenever <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> is around, there is the "chilling" sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit. It's also a real pity <PERSON>Rosanna Arquette</PERSON>'s is in this movie. I feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. Same goes for JÃ¼rgen <PERSON>Prochnow</PERSON>, who also has the misfortune to star in this movie. All in all, 2/10.
689 1 Another entry in the "holiday horror" category that fills the shelves of your local video store. The *spoiler* "wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him" plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before. And those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it. <PERSON>Marilyn Manson</PERSON> on the soundtrack and <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> and <PERSON>Katherine Heigl</PERSON> as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.
690 0 This can't be <PERSON>Mandy Schaffer</PERSON>'s last film. Somebody, do something! :-(<br /><br />Argh.<br /><br />What little life this one might have had, the directing finished off. Don't blame the cast; they did OK. Even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done, and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through. And please, please put <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. Ya' breakin' my haht, heah....<br /><br />Two specific criticisms, in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much). First, the way <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment, in order to see whatever she was supposed to see, and never got seen in return, was very annoying. <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives. It's dumb. Write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more. If your script isn't good enough to stand up without that, then don't produce it.<br /><br />Second, <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> pulled. She already had <PERSON>Traci</PERSON> fingered. More bad writing/directing there.<br /><br />I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it. Actually I didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have. It just didn't have much of a reason for being made, unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON>. Oh, and to whoever didn't think she was sexy... the character wasn't very well written, but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me.<br /><br />MORE <PERSON>MANDY</PERSON>. (Not to be confused with "<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON>" -- although I'd like to see her again too. ;-)<br /><br />P.S. Did I mention I hope <PERSON>Mandy</PERSON> makes me more movies? <:-D
691 1 The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. However it improved afterwards as the <ORGANIZATION>Valentine Party</ORGANIZATION> commenced. Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.
692 0 Because IT IS, that's why! This is the same jealous-daughter-kills-people flick we've seen a billion times. <PERSON>Rosanna Arquette</PERSON> makes anything worth watching, and <PERSON>Mandy Schaffer</PERSON>'s brief nude scene (after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film) at the end almost make this trite blarney worthwhile, but not quite.<br /><br />* out of ****
693 1 What an awesome movie! It was very scary, great acting, well-written, nice plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-horror fans, but is still (nonetheless) one of the best thrillers out there today! I highly recommend it to ONLY fans of:<br /><br />1) The horror genre<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2) An actor or actress featured in it.<br /><br />*** out of **** stars!<br /><br />PS- I am sick and tired of people comparing this, and other modern horror movies, with SCREAM. <PERSON>Ya</PERSON> know what, they didn't WANT to be like SCREAM. Everyone's like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I am not mistaking, SCREAM also copied other movies too! In fact, just about EVERY horror movie copied an earlier one. SCREAM, however, was a good film. But, still... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is!<br /><br />GO AND RENT THIS ONE!<br /><br />

695 1 Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. The death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good. <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON> did great as the female lead (much better than <PERSON>Jennifer Love Hewitt</PERSON> in the "I Know..." films). <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>, whom is the main reason I saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well. The exception to the list of good actors is <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>. She was horrible in this. The only scene I was glad to see her in was *SPOILER* her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before you watch "Scream" or "I Know..." again.
696 0 This movie is a crappy and forgettable <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> vehicle. The performances are generally crappy especially by <PERSON>Capshaw</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fishburne</PERSON>, and the usually solid <PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON>. <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> seems miscast as a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Academic</ORGANIZATION>. The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along. It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels. The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast. <PERSON>George Plimpton</PERSON> also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> as they debate the death penalty. The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery/thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree. The scripting and direction are extremely poor. <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>'s charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue. Manipulative, Violent, and Ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid It.
697 1 These slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun.<br /><br />The valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out.<br /><br />The film has one Peach of a line... "He's no Angel...." when he in fact IS Angel!!! Watching <PERSON>Buffy</PERSON> reruns will never be the same!<br /><br />The cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. Sorry but NO!<br /><br />The direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> and Heigel do not remove their clothes...:-(<br /><br />Essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the "borrowing" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. Psycho's shower scene is tributed, along with Halloween's "masking". <br /><br />Murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as I know!!!<br /><br />Light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. If it was a choice between The Hole and this though, choose The Hole. Slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher. A very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking!!!
698 0 A pot - boiler if ever I saw one. A supposed thriller borrowing from "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", even an inverted "In the Heat of the Night" with a little reverse murder, a la "Strangers on a Train" thrown in, it fails abysmally where all the above, to a large degree, succeeded. Namely, in delivering thrills. The plot seems condensed from a bigger book, making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving, while the direction lacks pace and verve. To rein in any kudos, a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too. <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely bothering with his attempt at a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of <PERSON>Hope Lange</PERSON> and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his. He even has a father in law who seems younger than him. <PERSON>Laurence Fishburne</PERSON> barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie - they do, confusedly, here. The rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles. The supposed climax managed too, to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back, not as should have been the aim, front edge of my seat. Mediocre sloppy <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> film making for sure.
699 1 Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie, <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON>. It was so well-made, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, etc! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (<PERSON>Lily</PERSON>'s death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely horrifying and creepy (<PERSON>Paige</PERSON>'s death), and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the entire cast did a great job, especially the three leads: <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> (both of whom I met, and got autographs from, during the filming of this movie - VERY nice people!), and <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON>.<br /><br />I am very sick of people calling this movie "another Scream clone". This movie is, in no way, a Scream clone. In fact, this film runs rings around Scream. It actually makes SENSE! Scream was also NOT the only movie to feature a masked killer in it. Excuse me, but it looks like Scream was also a clone too (ahem..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). I also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet, cupid face doing all of these horrible things. Another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! The ending gives me chills every time I see it!!!!! So, even if you didn't like it the first time, watch Valentine again and give it another chance!<br /><br />PS- Keep an eye out for my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon...
700 0 The performances of Fishbourne (who appears strangely funny somehow) and (short featured)<PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON> are remarkable, unlike <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>'s who doesn't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man. In fact the screenplay doesn't make sense; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters. It's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights' schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets. The capital punishment is not an issue here, although it is a subject from the beginning; it sort of fades away without further comment. The subject-matter and environment could have been good.
701 1 I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON> were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever. When I watched <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON>, I was amazed at how great the story line actually was. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor, and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful. It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets. I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills. Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please, DON'T...
702 0 1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10(<PERSON>Dir-Arne Glimcher</PERSON>): Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it's audience. The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie is going to be about something with <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>'s conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, contrived for the audience's sake, run of the mill, let's never get it over with, thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story, and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends. Yes there is some good acting here, especially from <PERSON>Blair Underwood</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fishburne</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON> in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited end.
703 1 It's a colorful slasher movie. That's about it.<br /><br />It has the mystery element that SCREAM made so popular in slasher movies, but I never care for such things. Figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway.<br /><br />The death scenes were inventive and gorey, bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like Friday the 13th. <br /><br />Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike in SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was obvious. <br /><br />People who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie. As simple as that. I truly enjoyed it and I plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same. <br /><br />--MB
704 0 Seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief. Beside <PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON> no-one seems to own the skills of acting. Even <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>, who I normally worship, must have had an off-day during the entire filming of Just Case. Not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me.<br /><br />This made this movie look cheap and unreal.<br /><br />The story makes up a little. It is thrilling, and the plot is unexpected.<br /><br />Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.
705 1 I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say that it was the best slasher movie that I've seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking. For those out there that hated "Scream," there is not one reference to "the horror rules" in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here). <br /><br />This is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick. I guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for. This is definitely a move in the right direction.<br /><br /><PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> stands out here as a fun character. You can tell she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
706 0 As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by <PERSON>Kate Capshaw</PERSON>, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in. <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud "dramatic" score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see, otherwise skip it.
707 1 I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. I classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial. Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director <PERSON>Jamie Blanks</PERSON>, after his Urban Legends. Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. Yet again unlike <ORGANIZATION>Urban Legends</ORGANIZATION> the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes Valentine the best. <br /><br />As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. Since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of Humanism: "Noone is entirely good or evil. In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted." Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. <br /><br />The second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: My favourite is <PERSON>Jessica Cauffiel</PERSON> who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. An arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. <PERSON>Katherine Heigl</PERSON> is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. <PERSON>Jessica Capshaw</PERSON> is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. <PERSON>Marley Shelton</PERSON> is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. Finally, <PERSON>Benita Ha</PERSON> is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>.<br /><br />The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at <PERSON>Dorothy</PERSON>'s house scenes and ultimately the killing themes. Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know. Hard Rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie.
708 0 Look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie: <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fishburne</PERSON>, <PERSON>Capshaw</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, <PERSON>Underwood</PERSON>, <PERSON>Beatty</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thigpen</PERSON>, even cameos by <PERSON>Slezak</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lange</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON>. They prove, in spades, the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script. The story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> standards. It's not particularly original, and the "twists" are downright cruel.
709 1 A group of model-caliber <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? <br /><br />My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an "F" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an "A".<br /><br />It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director <PERSON>Jamie Blanks</PERSON>, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme.<br /><br />Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichÃ©-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichÃ©d, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was "self-aware". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm "reading too much" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that <PERSON>Blanks</PERSON> said in interviews that he "didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend" and producer <PERSON>Dylan Sellers</PERSON> said he wanted to do something "more adult".<br /><br />Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by <PERSON>Tom Savage</PERSON>. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, "While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.<br /><br />Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. <PERSON>David Boreanaz</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Adam Carr</PERSON>, is involved in many of the funniest moments.<br /><br />While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.
710 0 Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from <PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON>. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>'s wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing <PERSON>Kate Capshaw</PERSON>) and kid (a very young <PERSON>Scarlet Johannsen</PERSON>) in an alligator skinner's shack. <br /><br />The kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once.
711 1 I, like many horror fans, have been force fed the same banal big budget <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> remakes and <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years. Here, at last, is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes.<br /><br />You want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, lots of it, by the bucket load - you got it.<br /><br />With excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the Hammer Horror scream queen herself <PERSON>Stephanie Beacham</PERSON>, this really is fantastic stuff.<br /><br />Despite it's low budget, by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director <PERSON>James Eaves</PERSON> has created something that feels much bigger.<br /><br />A must for old school horror fans.
712 0 The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an "edge-of-the-seat" film. But it disappoints, and disappoints severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "Friday the 13th" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.
713 1 Turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website which is worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
714 0 JUST CAUSE showcases <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> as a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> law prof, <PERSON>Kate Capshaw</PERSON> (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and <PERSON>Lawrence Fishburne</PERSON> as a racist southern cop (!) and <PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON> in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer.<br /><br />Weird casting, but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the Liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. The coroner, witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black.<br /><br /><PERSON>Connery</PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. He is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial.<br /><br /><PERSON>Connery</PERSON> is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good IL' boys club but finds that the case against <PERSON>Blair</PERSON>, the alleged killer, now on death row, was all fabricated. The main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him.<br /><br />The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting, <PERSON>Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris</PERSON>, he finds out where <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> hid the murder weapon.<br /><br />He gets a re-trial and <PERSON>Blair</PERSON> is freed.<br /><br />I think... film over....<br /><br />Then suddenly! It turns out that <PERSON>Blair</PERSON> IS a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to enlist <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>.

The final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama, <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fishburne</PERSON> fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades.<br /><br />That was one weird film.<br /><br />So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just bullies and <PERSON>Abu Graib</PERSON> type torturers, but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry.<br /><br />Truly depressing on every level! The system is completely rotten and the PC white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too.<br /><br />Two thumbs down. <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something.
715 1 The film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast, and excellent direction by <PERSON>James Eves</PERSON>. The movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from <PERSON>Stephanie Beecham</PERSON> and everyone is perfectly cast. <PERSON>James Eves</PERSON> has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax. He does this with an element of humour, Plenty of twists, thrills and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and screams. The movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure,but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action.Great !
716 0 <PERSON>Paul Armstrong</PERSON> is a liberal, Scottish-born, professor of law at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty, who is hired to take on the case of <PERSON>Bobby Earl</PERSON>, a young black man from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> who has been convicted of the rape and murder of <PERSON>Joanie Shriver</PERSON>, an eleven year old white girl. <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is <PERSON>Blair Sullivan</PERSON>, a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders. <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> visits <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> in his cell on death row, hoping to persuade him to confess to <PERSON>Joanie</PERSON>'s murder, thereby saving <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> from the electric chair. <br /><br />At first all goes well. <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> confesses and <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction. As this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film, it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer. "Warning! Major plot twist ahead!" And so it proves. The anticipated twist soon materialises. Earl, it transpires, is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted, and probably of several others as well, but hatched a diabolical plan together with <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> in order to secure his freedom; <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> will confess to <PERSON>Joanie</PERSON>'s murder if <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> will murder his parents. (Just why <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained). <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved; <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> has a grudge against <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON>'s wife, herself a lawyer, who acted as Counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> was accused of rape. <br /><br />"Just Cause" is an example of the auto-cannibalism in which <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> sometimes likes to indulge, cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others. The first half owes an obvious debt to films like "Intruder in the Dust" and "To Kill a Mockingbird"; about the only difference is that the Sheriff who beats a confession out of <PERSON>Bobby Earl</PERSON> is himself black, whereas in earlier films he would have been white. (Police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity). The central twist in the plot was borrowed from <ORGANIZATION>Costa-Gavras</ORGANIZATION>'s "Music Box", although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end. The finale, in which a lawyer, his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client, is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of "Cape Fear", which also take place in the swamplands of the American South. <PERSON>Ed Harris</PERSON>' characterisation of <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> as a Bible-quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of <PERSON>Robert de Niro</PERSON>'s character in the Scorsese version of "Cape Fear", made four years before "Just Cause". <br /><br />(There is a postscript. Just as "Just Cause" borrowed heavily from several other movies, seven years later its central plot twist was, in its turn, to be blatantly plagiarised in the <PERSON>Ashley Judd</PERSON> vehicle "High Crimes"). <br /><br />The trouble with this style of film-making-by-numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them. The whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts, and "Just Cause" is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it. <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances, largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing <PERSON>de Niro</PERSON> playing <PERSON>Max Cady</PERSON>. <PERSON>Blair Underwood</PERSON> is OK as <PERSON>Bobby Earl</PERSON> the (supposedly) innocent young man of the early scenes, but unconvincing as <PERSON>Bobby Earl</PERSON> the murderous psychopath of the later ones. <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> as <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Laurence Fishburne</PERSON> as the black Sheriff are rather better, but neither is good enough to save the film. (<PERSON>Connery</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> were to act together in another, better, film, "The Rock", the following year). <br /><br />There is another problem with "Just Cause". The first half of the film looks like a standard liberal "issue" movie, anti-death penalty, anti-racist and critical of heavy-handed policing. The second half looks more like the work of a die-hard reactionary, preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards, that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair, that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes. The filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the (presumably unwanted) effect of reversing its political stance, or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it. A suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency. 4/10
717 1 The Color Purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life. Every character had an element of the color purple in them. The movie touches on love, lost, hope, hate, and triumph. whether it be <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> having lived through hell and losing her sister, and <PERSON>Shug</PERSON> coming into her life to show her love again, <PERSON>Albert</PERSON> not being man righting his wrong toward <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shug</PERSON> shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end, <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION> and her stubborness good and bad, and even <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON>, they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that's the sign of a good movie. Good Job to all the cast and crew.
718 0 I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.<br /><br />The film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. I was left feeling surprised that <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fishburn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Capshaw</PERSON> had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for <PERSON>Bobby Earl</PERSON> was ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.<br /><br /><PERSON>Harris</PERSON> gave a terrific performance and <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> is like <PERSON>Morgan Freeman</PERSON> in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.
719 1 I can't believe I am just now seeing this film -- I think perhaps I thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated, and I avoided Roots for the same reason -- just as I have yet to see <PERSON>Schindler</PERSON>'s List -- I don't want to be "entertained" by other peoples' pain, not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be.<br /><br />So I guess the main thing I noticed about The Color Purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites. The black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters -- or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but everyone redeemed himself in the end, and the acting was phenomenal! I couldn't believe the character <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON> played at the age of 35! And I adore <PERSON>Whoopi</PERSON> to start with - she was amazing. I'm so glad I was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and <ORGANIZATION>Showtime</ORGANIZATION> was running The Color Purple.
720 0 I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the movie I was very disappointed. First of all, no disrespect to <PERSON>Deborah Raffin</PERSON> but she was too mature to play a woman of 24/25. The late <PERSON>Christopher Reeve</PERSON> was also miscast-same reason. Will, according to the book,was around 30. I would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend <PERSON>Red</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elly</PERSON>'s trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development. Also Miss <PERSON>Beasley</PERSON> was miscast as the book mentioned her being a Plus Size lady. I know the movie didn't have the budget of the "Bridges Of <LOCATION>Madison County</LOCATION>" which I believe was released around the same time. <br /><br />But to me this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie. As someone mentioned, I wish that Miss <PERSON>Spenser</PERSON> would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope that she would consider doing the casting too. The movie let me down!
721 1 11 Oscar nominations and zero win!!! Am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with <PERSON>Halle Berry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denzel Washington - Whoopi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON>, <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the Oscars that year...... it should go into the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges.... <br /><br />Its an amazing book - but true to <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON>'s style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so I am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out. <br /><br />The cinematography was amazing - the African scenes live much to be desired - the African part in the book is supposed to be set in <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> - somewhere in <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> - BUT oh no! <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> outside of the Safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary Zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> ---- and most of all why get the people to speak Swahili --- who in <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> speaks Swahili?? I just had to get that out of the way.......<br /><br />But as a story - amazing, film-making - out of this world - CLASSIC yes!!<br /><br />I own it and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
722 0 After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories, only the names and some of the book's story remained. Read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. The locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters not included. Television has microwaved so many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of that. Input from the author doesn't always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes.
723 1 Like I said at the top, four stars just aren't enough. It's one of the best films I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. For the people that don't really like it or understand it, you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span.<br /><br />Even if I haven't seen all his films yet, I'd have to say that this is <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> at his peak. It's pretty sad to see that movies as great as "The Color Purple" don't come along too often 'cause I think all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture entertainment in these hard times.<br /><br />Movies like this are more than just movies; they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more.<br /><br />The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars (even Best Picture of the Year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> can be sometimes. <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> wasn't even nominated for Best Director! It should have swept the Oscars that year.<br /><br />The film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people.<br /><br />If only movies were still this good....
724 0 Not to be confused with the <PERSON>Madonna</PERSON> film "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called "The Next Big Thing" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look like a masterpiece. Fraught with lousy acting, poor sets and costuming, etc., "...Thing" has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award. Pass on this one.
725 1 In the year 1985 (my birth year) <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> (Debut role for <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>) whose life is followed through rough times. The story begins from the year 1909 when <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> is only 14 years old. She has given birth two children for her father. <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> has a younger sister <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON> with whom she is inseparable. A widower lays his eyes on Nettie but their father gives <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> to him. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero. <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>'s story is a true survival story.<br /><br />"The Color Purple" is a master-piece and underestimated film of <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>. He should make more drama which "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are good notion.<br /><br />The cast is amazing. <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama. <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> was surprisingly nasty "Mister". I have never seen him in a such an evil role. The talk-show icon <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON> is brilliant as a strong-willed <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION>.<br /><br />Warning! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film. You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like I have with my sister.<br /><br />Big applauds to Mr. <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>!
726 0 what ends up killing this movie is its self-consciousness, among other things. here's a short list: 1. irreverent behavior. when the beatles came over and injected their brand of "quirky, irreverent" behavior/humor, it was greeted as fresh. that was over 4 decades ago. get over it.<br /><br />2. false sophistication. spewing out base, quasi-socio-political-isms is hard ground to make work comically. ask woody allen.<br /><br />3. the post-modern "i'm hard on this phony world and yes, i recognize it in myself" snake eating itself - used as illustration with another animal in the film itself! - is such a retread.<br /><br />4. smarmy, smug drollness.<br /><br />5. amateurish writing, acting, direction... ever seen student films? a victim of itself, about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself, and sheesh, now i'm getting caught up in the self-reflexive thing that it posits as worthwhile, of value.<br /><br />but towards... what? ultimately, it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hey, ever see woody allen's take on bergman, ie: "Interiors"??? well, this just does it more amateurishly.
727 1 This movie is about development. People growing and people fading, people surprising and people disappointing. It has it all and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> in her debut role.<br /><br />This movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10.<br /><br />PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
728 0 <PERSON>Larry Buchanan</PERSON>. Yep, same guy who did "Attack of the THE Eye Creatures" and two (count 'em: TWO) conspiracy movies about <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON>. He's to blame, here.<br /><br />Adding onto his ever-growing pile of folders left over from <PERSON>Oliver Stone</PERSON>'s "eh-I-grew-out-of-it" conspiracy drawer, here's "Down On Us (i.e.- "Beyond the Doors") which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy.<br /><br />Forget everything you THOUGHT you knew about <PERSON>Jimi Hendrix</PERSON>, <PERSON>Janis Joplin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Morrison</PERSON>, says Big Lar', cuz this is the real deal! Y'see, the three big names in rock of the '60s were KILLED BY THE GOVERNMENT because they were subversives or counter-productive to Truth, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and the American Way, or sumpthin' like that there. I knew it all along.<br /><br />Anyway, three people (<PERSON>Chatman</PERSON>, Meryl, <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>) who look eerily like their real life shadows (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn your backs and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths, the good old <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> of A put hits out on them! Yep, it's the truth!<br /><br />Man, I cannot believed I watched this movie. It's facts, when not stretching credibility to the snapping point, are ludicrous; the acting makes TV commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end, you deserve the "twist" ending. You really, really do; I swear. Genius.<br /><br />But like the man said: "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll."<br /><br />Not this flick, though.<br /><br />No stars for "Down on Us". And that's the movie audience describing the film, by the way....
729 1 <PERSON>Steven Speilberg</PERSON>'s adaptation of <ORGANIZATION>Alice Walkers</ORGANIZATION> popular novel is not without its share of controversy. When first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women.<br /><br />This is the story of a young black woman named <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, growing up in rural <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> after the turn of the century. She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth. Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister.<br /><br /><PERSON>Celie</PERSON> (played in later years by newcomer <PERSON>Whoopie Goldberg</PERSON>) is married off to an abusive husband (<PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>). The husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>'s life.<br /><br />The story is often heartbreaking as <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children. Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including <PERSON>Sophia</PERSON>, a tough as nails wife to her step son, and <PERSON>Shug</PERSON>, a loud and luscious saloon singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love.<br /><br /><PERSON>Speilberg</PERSON>'s direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to watch this film and not be moved! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story. While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON> to shine through.<br /><br />I couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film. Suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again, and which has left an indelible mark on me.<br /><br />
730 0 Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic directing, the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script, and a crappy copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor. Trust me, because I stuck this turkey out to the end. It was so pathetically bad all over that I had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of Springtime for <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>.<br /><br />The girl who played <PERSON>Janis Joplin</PERSON> was the only faint spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original.<br /><br />If you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better, then watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.
731 1 This is an excellent film, with an extraordinary cast and acting. I was very disappointed with the Academy Awards when this didn't get the Oscar for best film and for best actress (<PERSON>Woopi Goldberg</PERSON>)... it certainly deserved it. In any case, take a look at it. i am sure you will enjoy it very much.
732 0 Bad Actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. <br /><br /><PERSON>Preston Blake</PERSON> is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank, <br /><br />hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> jumped a row of cars.<br /><br />Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. In this case our hot heroine is a child molesting <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent who dates the eleven year old <PERSON>Preston</PERSON>, and promises another date when he turns 17. <br /><br />However, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as "The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur". It was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> does not give a damn about random people . What I have failed to explain is that <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> uses the alias "Macintosh" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after <PERSON>Preston</PERSON>, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to <PERSON>Preston</PERSON>'s limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.<br /><br />Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film. I don't see how it only has a 4.4/10.
733 1 This movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can't decide which was better, the book or the movie.<br /><br /><PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> is awesome, and <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON>, such a good actress, she could be funny, happy and miserable all at the same time. All together the movie was well directed by <PERSON>Steven Speilberg</PERSON>, and should not be passed up. 9/10
734 0 A young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up. Unfortunately, the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad. He wants his loot back. When he discovers who has the bucks, he begins trying to get it back. He keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man's hands. Sounds familiar, I'll bet. Very predictable, not interesting at all. Come up with something a bit different, ok guys?
735 1 "The Color Purple", is truly amazing. There is none like it, and I don't think there ever will be. It's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on. The actors are flawless and the directing is superb. I absolutely loved it. A movie has never made me so happy. It is beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
736 0 This movie is really goofy! I saw it as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12. I really didn't care for it, but I do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of, such as: 1)Does money buy happiness? 2)Should I lie (to my parents) about things I think they wouldn't approve of? 3)Does money buy friendships? 4)Is money everything? 5)Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well, in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt.
737 1 The Color Purple is a masterpiece. It displays the amazing acting abilities of <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>. Not only is <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this. It's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time!
738 0 I almost called <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie. I can just see the movie execs sitting around going, "Okay, we need to come up with something that's just like Home Alone, only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid, hire cut-rate actors, and oh yeah, we'll make it a lot less funny!"<br /><br />Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you've got here. Not even worth seeing if someone else rents it. And as a movie for kids? Forget it. I wouldn't let my kids see this, not necessarily because of bad-taste jokes, but because I wouldn't want them to say, "What were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage, Dad?!?!"
739 1 Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I have seen it at least a hundred times and I can't go through it without crying. I defy anyone to watch the reunion of <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON>, or <PERSON>Shug</PERSON> and father and not feel your eyes getting misty. <PERSON>Whoopie Goldberg</PERSON> should have one an award for amazing portrayal. And for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! Im a testament to that.
740 0 <ORGANIZATION>Blank Check</ORGANIZATION> is easily one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; its overtones of lonliness are pathetic. Do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film, like buying a mansion for a mere $300 grand. The notion, let alone the bargain-basement price, will only be believed by the most gullible viewers. Please, respect your intelligence and don't watch this awful, awful film.
741 1 I've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time I still FELT it.<br /><br />The story itself was incredible but came alive by <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s expertise and the fabulous cast including <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON>. <PERSON>Akosua Busia</PERSON> deserved an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON>.<br /><br />You'll experience every human emotion while watching this film. I laughed, cried, and got angry. Like most great movies it was looked over by the <ORGANIZATION>Academy</ORGANIZATION> with a host of nominations but no wins. But this movie, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best films of all time.
742 0 The worst movie I have seen in a while. Yeah its fun to fantasize, but if that is what you are looking for, I suggest you see Brewsters Millions. This was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny. Unless you are five or like terrible movies, don't see this one.
743 1 I remember when this film was up for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. And the fact that <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> directed the film did not persuade me one bit.<br /><br />Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> gives her best performance ever in this movie. <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. <br /><br />And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent "Beloved" did. I encourage anyone of any race to see this film. 9/10
744 0 I saw this movie once a long time ago, and I have no desire to ever see it again.<br /><br />This movie is about <PERSON>Preston Waters</PERSON>, a hard-lucked preteen, who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash. All this changes when a bank robber runs over <PERSON>Preston</PERSON>'s bike and passes him a blank check as compensation. <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> uses the check to withdraw $1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named Mr. <PERSON>Macintosh</PERSON> (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy with the money.<br /><br />On paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on screen, it is one of the emptiest movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's too unbelievable. I know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible, but I draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman, and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune. Also, this was a shallow movie with weak acting, a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying, or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
745 1 <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> wanted to win an Oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics (he was nominated for three of them: "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial". So he decided to get very serious by directing "The Color Purple", a period film with no special effects. <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s first serious drama is a remarkable movie. But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> any respect. "The Color Purple" received 11 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, but <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for Best Director. It got worse on Oscar night when this film didn't win a single Oscar. It got completely shut out. That wasn't right. "The Color Purple" should have won a couple of Oscars including one for <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>'s spectacular film debut as <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband (frightfully placed by <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>), then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends. <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON> also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION>, one of those friends' of <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>. Since I'm from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, I had already known <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide). Like <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON>, what a film debut! <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON> is terrific as <PERSON>Shug Avery</PERSON>, another friend who also happens to be the mistress of <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>'s rotten husband. All three actresses received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their work here (<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> for Best Actress; <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Avery</PERSON> for Best Supporting Actress). Set in the south during the first half of the 20th Century, "The Color Purple" is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end. It also made me laugh at times too. Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today. But <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> would eventully go on to win two Oscars years later for "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time. But he should have gotten nominated for this movie. The job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like "E.T." to a serious drama like "The Color Purple" was remarkable.<br /><br />**** (out of four)
746 0 <ORGANIZATION>Blank Check</ORGANIZATION> is a movie that I saw on TV one day and like most movies they air on TV Blank Check wasn't that good. First of all no one I have ever met has seen Blank Check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check won't be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar's films. I wouldn't call Blank Check a bad film but its not really entertaining either. (Or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go "what haven't I seen this before?" <ORGANIZATION>Blank Check</ORGANIZATION> rips off and tries to cash in on everything from <PERSON>Richie Rich</PERSON> to Home Alone (Which strangely enough both have <PERSON>Macaulay Culkin</PERSON> in it) Blank Check isn't a bad movie, but it deserves to fade into obscurity.
747 1 this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 & didn't really quite "get it"... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just blown away. <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable. it is one of his finest pieces of work & should not be missed!
748 0 Blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it's a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn't worth a dime. <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid's birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family? So he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous <PERSON>Shea Stanley</PERSON> were her parents mets fans? he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he's about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what? their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike? So <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he's juice he gives <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid! So <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> buys a mansion under the name Macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots <LOCATION>Shea</LOCATION> and talks about opening his account kid you're loaded and you're talking about opening an account? We soon realized <PERSON>Shea</PERSON> is actually an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice's then he told his cheapy dad he's got a job working for Mr Macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with <PERSON>Shea</PERSON> in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent? Afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up <PERSON>Shea</PERSON>'s 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting Mr <PERSON>Macintoshs</PERSON> birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn't pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to MacIntosh which he doesn't know it's his son he's talking to and talks about <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> to go home early what? an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances! so <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> cornered and when it seem all hope is lost <PERSON>Shea</PERSON> and a bunch of SWAT guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shea</PERSON>? there is and she kisses him in the lips what? what? what? A grown woman kissed a kid in the lips. come on is she mentally disabled? I mean an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent who knows the country's laws would risk her career to kiss a kid? she could get arrested on the spot! and the most creepiest part of all is that isn't goodbye and she'll see him in 6 or 7 years! oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought? What are they smoking? The bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it's flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn't funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot's shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider-man films so people don't waste your money and go watch home alone instead. <br /><br />This has been a <PERSON>Samuel Franco</PERSON> review.
749 1 Rating "10/10" Master piece<br /><br />Some years ago, i heard <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>, i guess nothing is perfect, but this movie - together with schindler's List - is your best. Even <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON> acts well in this one !<br /><br />What got me most is the realism of the story and drama. Stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world.
750 0 Two years ago, on Berlin Film Festival we watched the <PERSON>Amos Kollek</PERSON> movie "Sue" in the Panorama program, with a wonderful <PERSON>Anna Thomson</PERSON> in the leading part. It's a film about loneliness and sex, and how the one thing is compensated by the other. In the same section on the Festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of Sue, "Extension du domaine de la lutte", which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having NO sex is one and the same problem. But unfortunately we can't sympathize with "our hero" (how he is called by the story-teller), because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself. Own fault, I'm sorry. I can't understand him. Not enough, the writer/director/actor want us admitting to him, that it's not his destroyed self-consciousness or the passivity of his personality, what brought him so far, but the rotten society and its image of sexuality. Yes, there are some deeper insights about gender relations, but we won't follow him so far... And the point is, that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate, having no sex. Who didn't notice yet, it's a quite depressing film...<br /><br />In the beginning, there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation. At the bed store the "hero" speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed. Perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs, you have to stay at home half a day... THIS is a satire about a character, who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands, DOING something... The movie doesn`t follow this path, but handles his characters with helplessness. Nobody believes, that "our hero" is able to instigate <PERSON>Tisserand</PERSON> for a murder. Too dull, too kind, too - passive (not to mention <PERSON>Tisserand</PERSON>'s complex; he has an inhibition, but he couldn't be, of course, a murderer of women!). To finish: There are women and the world, it's not a device of a modern sexualized society. Help you as you can, but don't follow the messages and the "wisdom" of this movie, which announces bankruptcy to human relationships, without seizing the real conflicts within.
751 1 this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen. i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on TV i my eyes are glued to it. the acting and plot are amazing. it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics. i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
752 0 The French film "Extension Du <ORGANIZATION>Domaine De La Lutte</ORGANIZATION>" directed by iconoclast film maker <PERSON>Philippe Harel</PERSON> is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer <PERSON>Michel Houellebecq.He</PERSON> has also worked on this film's scenario.According to British cinema magazine Sight and Sound,it is also known as "Whatever".This film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers.The film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character.This makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read. The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend.Instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall.Beware:some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists.
753 1 <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s first dramatic film is no let-down. It's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. Furthermore, <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> was excellent as Mr. And usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies. But in this, he completely branches out and is someone else for once. But, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>. She is excellent as <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>. You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie.<br /><br />Now, I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed.
754 0 Don't even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, <PERSON>Richard Grieco</PERSON> hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. <PERSON>Nick Mancuso</PERSON> phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and <PERSON>Nancy Allen</PERSON> manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clichÃ©d lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" purrs <PERSON>Richard Grieco</PERSON> to every single one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
755 1 Genteel, softly spoken drama from <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> was his first real venture into this genre. A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, "Schindler's List".<br /><br />Based upon <PERSON>Alice Walder</PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON>. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and <PERSON>Menno Meyjes</PERSON>' scrambling screenplay. "The Color Purple" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s novel. A real shame that maestro <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.<br /><br />Performances are strong throughout, with <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> who just yearns to be loved. <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> lends solid support, though his "Moses" was a superior turn for him in "Places in the Heart". The standout showing comes from the unheralded <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON> as Miss <PERSON>Sophia</PERSON>, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adolph Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rae Dawn Chong</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Quincy Jones</PERSON> ( co-producer with <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kathleen Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frank Marshall</PERSON> ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from <PERSON>Michael Kahn</PERSON> is sound as always, while director of photography <PERSON>Allen Daviau</PERSON> shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery.<br /><br />This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
756 0 ... but the keyword here is "usually." I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously. The makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly, even if it's a heavy topic. I get the impression, however, that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously, like they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots. Nevertheless, despite all this, I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars, as I am biased towards movies like this. If you're a B-rated fan, however, I would try too hard to find this one.
757 1 These days <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s "The Color Purple" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. What's even more alarming is that <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> himself wasn't even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.<br /><br />The story concerns the trials and tribulations of <PERSON>Celie Johnson</PERSON> (<PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>'s relationships with the women around her. It's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick'.<br /><br />The story is an interesting one, livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but I didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> (Best Actress), <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON> (Best Supporting Actress) and <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON> (Best Supporting Actress). I think that <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> were certainly deserving and <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> was unaccountably stiffed.<br /><br />As already mentioned, <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> didn't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such an omission beggars belief, since <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s direction here is top-notch. I'm not especially crazy about <PERSON>Quincy Jones</PERSON>'s score but it's not below average by any means.<br /><br />In the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-told by a master film-maker working from Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on Oscar night.
758 0 The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents. This is Bollywood at its best/worst, I honestly cannot tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clichÃ©s on every level, story-line, situations, dialog, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you must be a retard to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from it, because I could not take it any more. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /><br />
759 1 1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' Oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single title: such was the Academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for <ORGANIZATION>Schindler</ORGANIZATION>'s List, which is, arguably, not as good (and I'm half-Polish).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, <PERSON>Schindler</PERSON> was a classic. And I'm not knocking 'Out of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>' (which won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big cryer.<br /><br />Maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: <PERSON>Whoopi</PERSON>, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON>.<br /><br />The rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?
760 0 I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie. Its a big joke. Good.. Its entertaining .. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film .. I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.<br /><br />Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman/Rani who want a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life.<br /><br /><PERSON>Rani</PERSON> appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & <PERSON>Salman</PERSON>. She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>Preity</ORGANIZATION> so they may have some romance. When will the audience get fed up of <PERSON>Salman</PERSON>'s nakhras.<br /><br />Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
761 1 Taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s, <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> directed <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> in an adaptation of <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON>'s "The Color Purple", about about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> play <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like "Sister Act". This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no, make that SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen (you'll know it when you see it). I can't believe that this didn't win a single Oscar; it may be <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s second best movie behind "Schindler's List" (maybe even tied with it). Also starring <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adolph Caesar</PERSON>, <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willard E. Pugh</PERSON>, <PERSON>Akosua Busia</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Laurence Fishburne</PERSON>.
762 0 This movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother. A whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not a surrogate mother. Neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have seen Indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible, but they don't pretend to be either. This movie wants us to emote along with the characters, but this can't done with such a ridiculous, contrived conflict. I would have expected better from <PERSON>Abbas</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Mustan</LOCATION>.
763 1 I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old clichÃ© by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple.<br /><br />It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.<br /><br />Also the acting performances are superb - especially <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON> who I now have a new found respect for.<br /><br />Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.
764 0 Hail Bollywood and men Directors !<br /><br />Really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by Indian Woman !!<br /><br />Viewing the current state of affairs in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> where The wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the Directors ..also can be called Uncle Scars (refer movie The Lion King) came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves ...including the spermikins !!<br /><br />Story line : Married couple - very happy - but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage - lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother !<br /><br />Now in in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, the in- laws usually drive away the daughter- in- law if she fails to give them an heir ! So the wife hits upon a major plan - surrogate mother...but the scientists intervened - "Sure artificial insemination" - NO said the artist (Director actually) - "Neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter - in - law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother !!<br /><br />Neighbours ! society !! gosh the same ones who watch Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 ...al in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making !!<br /><br />SO the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot !<br /><br />He hires the lead dancer in the pub - asks her to bear his baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - becomes pregnant - wife and kept - both co-exist in the same house - in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life - so much caring people around - she misses them all and cries silently !! In the mean time - no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat !!- the mother or other elderly people never took her for check-ups - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !!
765 1 One of the finest films ever made! Why it only got a 7.6 rating is a mystery. This film is a window into the world of the black experience in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10. I recommend watching it with "The Long Walk Home" as a companion piece. If you think <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>'s work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "<ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Squares</ORGANIZATION>," think again. Don't miss this movie, which should have won the Oscar. (And read the book, too!)
766 0 The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest. But, throughout watching this film, we were saying aloud, "These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good...why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the film the sound was echoy, garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.<br /><br />There is some good acting in this film, and I think <PERSON>Jim Thalman</PERSON> is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget film.<br /><br />I just can't reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it's worth doing right. Could've earned a 6.
767 1 This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when hearing <PERSON>Quincy Jones</PERSON>' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows. This is truly a film to cry and die for...! The whole cast gives the best performance in a film I've seen in years and <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> has really outdone himself! <PERSON>Whoppi Goldberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON>(oh lord!), <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>, and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> IS <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong together with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON> is wonderful as <PERSON>Shug Avery</PERSON>, even when she's at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners", indeed, "have souls too". The always sympathetic, charming <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(I'd say sir)<PERSON>Quincy Jones</PERSON> adds even more beauty to this splendid film! The photography, the music, the director and the music makes this beautiful, soulful movie into an experience of life. You don't want to miss it! "Sista'...remember my name..."
768 0 I don't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. The city, renowned for its beauty, has rarely appeared uglier than in this film. A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.<br /><br />While the acting and plot can't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss. Actually, I found the most interesting performance to be <PERSON>Irit Levi</PERSON> as a crusty and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) police detective. She's interesting, though not necessarily convincing.<br /><br />Highlights: the film's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist, <PERSON>Ron Athey</PERSON>.
769 1 The film version of <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON>'s hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel (written largely as letters from the central character <PERSON>Celie</PERSON> to God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so.<br /><br />In the role of the abused and awakened <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> gave her best screen performance by miles. Not far behind her was <PERSON>Oprah Winfrey</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION>, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast fleshed out the characters <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> had introduced so clearly on the page - <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON> as <PERSON>Albert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>'s abusive husband; <PERSON>Margaret Avery</PERSON> as <PERSON>Shug</PERSON>, a force of change for the good; <PERSON>Willard Pugh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rae Dawn Chong</PERSON> as <PERSON>Harpo</PERSON> and Squeak; <PERSON>Susan Beaubian</PERSON> as <PERSON>Corrine</PERSON>, the preacher's wife; and the much-missed <PERSON>Carl Anderson</PERSON> (otherwise best known as <PERSON>Judas</PERSON> in the 1973 film of <PERSON>Jesus Christ Superstar</PERSON>) as preacher <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON>.<br /><br />Beautifully paced and sensitively written, 'The Color Purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama.
770 0 Poorly written conspiracy drama/mystery about the possibility that AIDS was introduced to the public by the government. <PERSON>Wlaschiha</PERSON> plays a gay researcher looking for answers--that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find. Despite the cinematography itself being commendable, the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow, amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey. Grade: D+
771 1 A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The fact is, <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON>, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. THE COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like JAWS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare. It is quite an entrance. No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON>. One surprise is how <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves. <br /><br /><PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. It is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. EMPIRE OF THE SUN, ALWAYS, <PERSON>SCHINDLER</PERSON>'S LIST, etc.. His awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because A) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, B) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and C) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. It is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single Academy Award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.<br /><br /><PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> is fabulous as the tortured <PERSON>Celie</PERSON>, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>, who she only knows as "Mister". The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with "Mister". The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> novel. This is not "The Burning Bed" in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> by any means. There is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. It happens gracefully. <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. The films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON>Nettie</PERSON> (played by <PERSON>Akosua Busia</PERSON>) are separated, maybe forever. (Possibly foreshadowing Holocaust separation of child and parent?) You may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.<br /><br />The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.<br /><br />RATING: 10 of 10
772 0 <PERSON>Jochen Hick</PERSON> wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the AIDS virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease. Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film, this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism.<br /><br /><PERSON>Stefan</PERSON> (<PERSON>Tom Wlaschiha</PERSON>) journeys from <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused. He meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory, but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation. Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place, each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from <PERSON>Puccini</PERSON>'s opera 'Turandot' which just happens to be opening at the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION>. A police investigator <PERSON>Louise Tolliver</PERSON> (<PERSON>Irit Levi</PERSON>) and her companion cop (<PERSON>Kalene Parker</PERSON>) follow the murders while <PERSON>Stefan</PERSON> makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory. He encounters a strange lad <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jim Thalman</PERSON>) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor <PERSON>Burroughs</PERSON> (<PERSON>Richard Conti</PERSON>) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects. How this all come to an end is the play of the film, a story as much about the search for self identity between <PERSON>Stefan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeffery</PERSON> as it is a case for investigation of murders.<br /><br />While <PERSON>Tom Wlaschiha</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Thalman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Conti</PERSON> do well with their roles (they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film!), the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented <PERSON>Irit Levy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kaylene Parker</PERSON>: when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero. There are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit, but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of 'Nessun dorma' as sung by Mario del <ORGANIZATION>Monaco</ORGANIZATION> from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film! Good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors, but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing. <PERSON>Grady Harp</PERSON>, February 06
773 1 <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>'s visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. Unfortunately the terrible acting by <PERSON>Ekin Cheng</PERSON> and especially <PERSON>Cecilia Cheung</PERSON> (I felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times.<br /><br />This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw this, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung-fu novels! Without a doubt this is one of the best-looking Chinese historical kung-fu epic ever made.<br /><br />But alas, <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> hasn't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either). To make it worse, this movie is very badly cast. They decided to use the "hot" popular <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both <PERSON>Ekin Cheng</PERSON> and especially <PERSON>Cecilia Cheung</PERSON> are totally unsuited for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. <PERSON>Adam Cheng Siu-Chow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brigitte Lin</PERSON> in the 1983 version are infinitely better.<br /><br />I wish that someday <PERSON>Zhang Yi-Mou</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of <PERSON>Tsui</PERSON> but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of Zhang...
774 0 One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that <PERSON>Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha</PERSON> is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) amateurish. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate<br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film.
775 1 This movie is good. It's not the best of the great CG kung fu flicks but its pretty good. First thing first, the story is actually good. The whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool. My problem is theres too many characters! It got very confusing when they switched scenes! The special effects were INCREDIBLE! The fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex. This movie practically all computer generated. The acting is superb, as always expected from such high profile players. <PERSON>Ekin Cheng</PERSON> makes an excellent protagonist, loner character. <PERSON>Zhang Ziyi</PERSON> did nothing for me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping. The bad guy, the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening. The music is also excellent. To me this story deserve at least a mini-series and not just ONE movie. Theres too much story to cram in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details. This movie sacrifices story integrity for action. I reccomend Storm Riders over this any day.
776 0 I can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with <ORGANIZATION>Paris Hilton</ORGANIZATION>, and sure it's his company. But "you're fired" or "you're hired", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />I'd love to hear just one person get up and say "<PERSON>Donald</PERSON> I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo". I see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that.
777 1 ...and I love it. Lots of special effects, and for a movie that's not made on mega budget, this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all, but this was still a great flick to watch. It's definitely up there in standards surpassing Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like <PERSON>Harry Potter</PERSON>. Which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits.<br /><br />One thing I really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. The topic is exotic and original. Production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of <LOCATION>HK</LOCATION> for fantasy action movie, and acting is great.<br /><br />One of the best movies to come out of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, this is the Infernal Affairs of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> fantasy movie, and I hope they'll continue working in this area, until they surpass <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> adventure movies.<br /><br />Just fantastic.
778 0 I bet you <PERSON>Gene Simmons</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vincent Pastore</PERSON> negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just too contrived for <PERSON>Gene</PERSON> to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big <PERSON>Pussy</PERSON>? What the hell was that "look at me, I'm a rat!" double episode crap? All that clichÃ© mafia banter- COME ON! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama! <PERSON>Mark Burnett</PERSON>'s other show, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when <PERSON>Johnny Fairplay</PERSON> stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />Yuk!
779 1 yeah right. <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON> already acted in the main role in 1983's "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain". Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time, he finally does it right. You seldom see him in wuxia, more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick. But this role simply does fit him! The ancient Chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies (as far as I know about movies translated for the west). Although, the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie! And that makes it so great! And wow: all the colors plus the enormously deep, right-into-the-heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant. The first time I watched it, I had to watch it again instantly, and I did. OK true, I didn't understand all of it the first time. But that makes it only better! You know, you didn't understand all of it, because there is so much spice in it! Therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again. And yeah, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you watch it.<br /><br />Summary: A story to love, characters you cry with, and truly: a movie you never forget! -- Editors note: well, I think I must watch it right now again :D
780 0 I LOVED the Apprentice for the first two seasons.<br /><br />But now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things are getting just plain too tiring.<br /><br />I used to like the show, but its become <PERSON>Donald Trumps</PERSON> own ego fest. Granted its his company you'll be working for, but come on! some of the things says "You're FIRED" is just insulting.<br /><br />after watching the show, I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or such. Its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm. Good Entertainment? YES, but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring.. its not team work, its not personal, its just business. watch your back jack.
781 1 The first thing I thought when I saw this films was: It is not really a film, at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "film". it is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not acquainted with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy-tale... and even a weird one, chaotic. For me "The legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I do like it. It tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness, the fight that is as old as humanity, and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I am not a <ORGANIZATION>Buddhist</ORGANIZATION>. My religion and the vision of the world and human is different. But as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other. It is a really beautiful film! And I which we had more films like this - films that have a meaning. There are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly.
782 0 For the first couple of seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show. The combination between reality TV and a 16 week job-interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there".<br /><br />The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (that means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.). The boardroom can be entertaining to watch, but it's entertainment at it's low-point - Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old <PERSON>Jerry Springer</PERSON> episode. The tasks on the show are, at most, boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> for the publicity. And what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? That is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life. <br /><br />I have absolutely NO respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem like idiots to me. In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems like <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest, I can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth.<br /><br />R.I.P The Apprentice. Please <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, for God's sake, get the show off the air as soon as possible. It's just too embarrassing to watch. The Apprentice was once a great TV-show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
783 1 "Zu:The warriors from magic mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>'s use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued doing this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to "Zu"warriors from magic mountain"! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know,he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen,you simply won't believe! I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! This movie easily can beat big budget <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor! In most of <PERSON>Tsui Harks</PERSON>'s movies he combines drama,fantasy,martial arts and humor. Somehow it is missing in this movie. Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters. "Legend of Zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic!
784 0 Besides being boring, the scenes were oppressive and dark. The movie tried to portray some kind of moral, but fell flat with its message. What were the redeeming qualities?? On top of that, I don't think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did.
785 1 The Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film. They were expecting something akin to Star Wars, and it was not that. <PERSON>Joseph Campbell</PERSON>, I believe, would have liked this film. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords within us. We all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. Granted some of the narration was a bit confusing, and some of the action got a little hokey at times, but I think other points of the film easily made up for it. I'd watch it again. <br /><br />I don't know if there's a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The dubbed <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> version.) It might have been dumbed down for American audiences, which really would have detracted from this film.
786 0 For anyone craving a remake of 1989's Slaves of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. What are there, seven of you? Here it is... was.<br /><br />This undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (Well they're club-kids, ya big jerk!) that are in holding patterns. The big question seems to be, just how long can a young adult remain juvenile? It took three people to write this 'story'? Good god, it was easier to come up with Citizen <PERSON>Kane</PERSON>. Rather than take viewers back, this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s.<br /><br />The idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-somethings could imagine it. The odd sidebar about library work is not the sub-plot one expects from the equivalent of <PERSON>Parker Posey</PERSON>'s Breakin 2: <ORGANIZATION>Electric Bugaloo</ORGANIZATION>. Her "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical. <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>'s shtick is always amusing, but there are projects that are beneath her. I was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark.
787 1 for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects, watch this movie! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen. you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff.
788 0 I cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. So after watching the trailer for "Water Lilies," I expected to like this film because I thought I'd stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of "Beautiful Thing." <br /><br />The main characters are young French women 15 years old. <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; <PERSON>Floriane</PERSON> is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. The erotic interrelationship between <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Floriane</PERSON> is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it. <br /><br />"Water Lilies," however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless, mechanical sex. It also proves that screenwriters and film-makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.<br /><br />In the extra features on the "Lord of the Flies" DVD, director <PERSON>Peter Brook</PERSON> says, "French cynicism starts with the arousal of sex," meaning the French regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. Part of the downfall of this film is film-maker <PERSON>Celine Sciamma</PERSON> has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.<br /><br />"Where is the joy?" I asked myself while watching this film. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-affirming way. These positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no balance.<br /><br />Organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. But <PERSON>Sciamma</PERSON> is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. First, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by films like "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably; The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends; Beau Pere" and "Europa, Europa"; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - "See, audience, I can make a film where I show only the unattractive person nude." Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go.<br /><br />There is a scene in a club where <PERSON>Floriane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> are dancing. What follows next is not just <PERSON>Floriane</PERSON> cynically manipulating <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>; it is film-maker <PERSON>Sciamma</PERSON> cynically manipulating her audience.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when <PERSON>Floriane</PERSON> warns <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> she's about to request something that is "not normal." <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> understandably asks, "Who cares about being normal?" Then <PERSON>Sciamma</PERSON> plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because <PERSON>Floriane</PERSON>'s request is a phony, derivative and substitute question - not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>'s character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve. <br /><br />Here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves: 1) Since when do the French - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2) What teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?<br /><br />The three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors. <PERSON>Louise Blachere</PERSON> (<PERSON>Anne</PERSON>) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. <PERSON>Adele Haenel</PERSON> (<PERSON>Floriane</PERSON>) could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. <PERSON>Pauline Acquart</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marie</PERSON>) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. In the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.<br /><br />All in all, "Water Lilies" was very disappointing. Will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. And yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.
789 1 This is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>. It is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to <PERSON>Steven Chow</PERSON>'s Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the movie started,there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were<br /><br />deplicted with superb style. If you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts "geek", you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3D effects and realistic computer generated weapons. There, comes a fine performance(as always) from <PERSON>Ekin Cheung</PERSON> who plays "Sky King". He teams up with <PERSON>Louis Koo</PERSON>(Red) who i was very impressed by his flexible "wing" which deflected incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way. Not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline. Many Criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just "shoved in random bits of debrise" and even describe as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer cannot rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are famarialy with "<PERSON>Wu Xia</PERSON>" movies will have a better appoach. In due respect. there can be one weakness that could be foreseen. The blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made.In spite of all this, its a must see.
790 0 When I ordered this from Blockbuster's website I had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I'd forgotten to take my ADD meds that day. I do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon, donned in their late 70's-style wide collars, bell-bottoms and feathered hair, I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.<br /><br />The first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe, forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer. From the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the "monsters" from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'The Vagina Monologues'.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear. The "ship" was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old VCR and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path. Of course if moved slower than <PERSON>Bob Barker</PERSON>'s impacted bowels, but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two (with some assistance).<br /><br />Moving on... As the weirdness and bell bottoms continue... We found out that they're caught in a "Space Time Warp". How do we garner this little nugget of scientific information? Because the oldest male lead tells his son that, in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion, like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was pops a scientist? Nope, but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and <PERSON>Einstein</PERSON>'s theories.<br /><br />The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, other than that, it was really, really, really bad. (There's not enough 'really's' to describe it, really).<br /><br />I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. I never saw this film on its original release, but even back then I think I would've come to the same conclusion: bury this one quick.
791 1 Visually stunning and full of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Philosophy</ORGANIZATION>, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>, the man behind some of the best films <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> cinema has produced. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons. If thinking is not your forte, however, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go see the latest from the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> studio's no brain club, but if you are looking for something more, he's where you will find it.
792 0 I saw this when it was in the theater, it started out so strong I mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent AT THE time. Now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations, and other related psychological factors. Now as I said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining. It builds to an excellent climax then.... IT ends I mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it, besides being a very poetic description. In my experience, it was just not strong enough. My wife and I were well... how can I say this? We were upset, I mean we paid money, invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent. "We both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly. In fact my wife said it best, it did not end, IT JUST STOPPED!
793 1 Legend of Zu<br /><br />I remember well <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>'s original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier. Over one Christmas, on a rare week when Channel 4 in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> showed a week of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> movies, <PERSON>Zu Warriors</PERSON> was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...<br /><br />In fact, I think the original <ORGANIZATION>Zu Warriors</ORGANIZATION> is one of the earliest films I saw as a kid that I can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from. And the memories of seeing <PERSON>Yuen Biao</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON> and others in their classic prime.<br /><br />So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension. Could it beat the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies?<br /><br />Well the answer is I can't say. But that was because this isn't really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different.<br /><br />The Legend of Zu tells of the story of <PERSON>King Sky</PERSON>, a lone warrior, whose master, <PERSON>Dawn</PERSON>, declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, <PERSON>Dawn</PERSON> is reincarnated as Enigma, and Insomnia has returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile White Eyebrows and Red try, with the help of King Sky, to stop Insomnia.<br /><br />The plot isn't one full of twists and turns, but had enough detail in it to keep me interested. But I can see this film as one you either love or you hate. The film is very much about the special effects, with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments, much like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this film was one which didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. Nothing appears rushed - unlike Hero. The backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes.<br /><br />The story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing. It was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks', but generally each character had its part in the story. But some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion, and I somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this.<br /><br /><PERSON>Ekin Cheng</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis Koo</PERSON> play very central roles in the film, but I couldn't say this film showed their best performances. <PERSON>Cecilia Cheung</PERSON> appears to at least have matured in her acting, but it is still quite raw. <PERSON>Kelly Lin</PERSON> was the new revelation for me. Despite her very short role, I have apologise and admit to ogling!<br /><br />Overall, I have to say, did enjoy this film as much as I enjoyed the 'original'. Given that both movies are made by the legendary <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> has changed over two decades. And one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all, as much as apples are apples and pears are pears.<br /><br />Ultimately, both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right. And I'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again.<br /><br />Two to watch, but not compare.
794 0 Okay, now what the hell is this supposed to be? Is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"? Or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" and "The Lost World"? Perhaps it's an intellectual & philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend? Yes, that must be it! Whatever it is, the creators of "The Day Time Ended" (good old <PERSON>John 'Bud' Cardos</PERSON> of "Kingdom of the Spiders" and writer <PERSON>David Schmoeller</PERSON> of "Tourist Trap") must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres. The story doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but, hey, who cares as long as it's got papier-mÃ¢chÃ© dinosaurs, miniature spacecrafts, headache-inducing light & laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas! The voice-over introduction is practically inaudible, but no worries as it's all gibberish! Did you know that the definition of 'time' isn't what we all think it is? Time doesn't necessarily pass by chronologically, it is one giant paradox! Words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us. I have absolutely NO idea what all this means, but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap-dancing midget aliens and well-mannered dinosaurs on screen together. I deliberately say well-mannered dinosaurs, because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets. The crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar-powered house in the middle of nowhere. Grandpa is extremely annoying, the granddaughter even more, granny is a walking & talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery, the youngest son strangely resembles <PERSON>Prince Valiant</PERSON> and the young mother is Â… incredibly hot! <PERSON>Chris Mitchum</PERSON> for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy's husband on business travel. The special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable (I sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about "excellent special effects" was being sarcastic), but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs! Just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing: <br /><br />Grandpa: "You know what this is, don't you? This is a time-space warp!<br /><br /><PERSON>Stevie</PERSON>: "I'm not quite sure if I know what that means, dad"<br /><br />Grandpa: "Well, I guess nobody really does" <br /><br />Make up your mind, gramps! Do you know what it is or don't you? And stop talking about "The Vortex" like you're some kind of expert in the field! "The Day Time Ended" is an incredibly childish and not-worth-bothering-for fantasy movie, though I can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects. The ending completely comes out of nowhere, like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly.
795 1 I have to admit that <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence. A Chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience, the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of Zu Mountain and this is what he displayed.<br /><br />The new Legend of <PERSON>Zu</PERSON> has truly improved from the one in 1983. From this new millenium update, we could see <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>'s vision of the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs, amazing action-fantasy epic made beautifully well. Kept me glued through the entire picture. Great cast with just fine acting. It's truly a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird?<br /><br />Now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie. Plot may not have much relation among characters, but by rewatching the movie, you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself. Some can complain there isn't too much physical combat, besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes, spirits fighting by hand-to-hand wouldn't really make sense at all. <br /><br />I appreciated this nice stylish picture. It may have a thin story, but hey look at <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>'s "Time & Tide," we got confused by the plot as well, but it was truly something stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark always attracts something different into H.K. Cinema. American audiences, may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie, cause this ain't no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but it's special effects is truly better than Storm Riders. This is really worth checking out.
796 0 C'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (<PERSON>Yeoman Barrow</PERSON>'s) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.<br /><br />This use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.<br /><br />Except a few notable exceptions i.e "The city on the edge of forever" , "assignment Earth" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday" The old series of Star Trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.<br /><br />This is typical of the boring stuff <PERSON>Gene Roddenberry</PERSON> produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a LOT of rubbish! He doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as <PERSON>Irwin Allen</PERSON> for example.<br /><br />Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper ! Every expense spared or what !
797 1 I'm stunt, I must admit I never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene. If you like the fantastic genre, like me, you will certainly be more than satisfied! All character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection, in one word, flawless! I will listen to this movie a lot in the next years.
798 0 This picture started out with good intentions, <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and <PERSON>Shue</PERSON> is cute as usual in her role. It all falls apart after that, it's your typical <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul. In other words, don't waste your time watching this. Get the audiocassette tape with <PERSON>John DeLancie</PERSON> as the Invisible Man instead, also starring <PERSON>Leonard Nimoy</PERSON>. Now that was good, and <PERSON>HG Wells</PERSON> is well served, unlike with this mess.
799 1 This movie is very cool. If you're a fan of <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> and Chinese fantasy films, you should love this. This film is the Asian Lord of the rings: A high fantasy story, based in actual Chinese mythology. (I realize many critics have called this film plot-less, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or <ORGANIZATION>Warriors of Heaven & Earth</ORGANIZATION>, this one should be right up your alley. This film is still very difficult to find in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, even though it was purchased for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> distribution along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Well worth the search!!! This DVD is also worthy of owning.
800 0 I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie. It's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle, overlooking the <LOCATION>Capitol Building</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C</LOCATION>. That kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films, but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>'s previous, facially stupid movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop the wondering. He's just plain bad.
801 1 When <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him. Legend of Zu is possibly 6Hours condensed into 1h40. One does not understand all, but like at "2001 A Space Odyssey" you also don't have to, but one feels the power of the film to every second, every picture. An extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering, astounding, rejoicing in the recent years. VITAL severe MASTERPIECE! It's absolutely perfect as it is.<br /><br />When <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him. Legend of Zu is possibly 6Hours condensed into 1h40.

It's absolutely perfect as it is. 10000000000000/10000000000000
802 0 That's what I found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film. First off, the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! Those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though...<br /><br />None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable 3rd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than that!!!<br /><br />Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from 1933. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. If more attention had been paid it, <PERSON>Kevin bacon</PERSON>'s mad scientist might have made a little more sense. <br /><br />The movie would actually be much more successful as a porno, since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner. But this piece of work... go see something else. Or don't, and live with the consequences!<br /><br />3/10
803 1 I just came back from <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> on my summer vacation and saw the Legend of ZU. I thought it kicked a*s! It was so creative and unique. It's the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with a lot less drama. Even if some thought there was too much special FX(yeah right!), you can't complain about the cast. <PERSON>Zhang Ziyi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cecilia Cheung</PERSON> are so fine!!! The Legend of ZU.....kicks a*s!!!!!!!!
804 0 To describe this film as garbage is unfair. At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. This flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining.<br /><br /><PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> can act superbly given the chance, so no doubt had an <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay. The mad scientist story of 'Hollow Man' has been told before, been told better, and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects.<br /><br />Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies. In the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> they were marketed as 'The Transparent Man (/Woman/Dog)' which is maybe where they got the title for this film.<br /><br />Clever special effects, dire script, non-existent plot.<br /><br />
805 1 I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the <ORGANIZATION>Magic Mountain</ORGANIZATION>. In that film, the setting takes place in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension!! Thank that to <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>'s extensive use of CGI effects. He's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the ultra cool Moon Orb.<br /><br />While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romance aspect is there, although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor. <PERSON>Cecilia Cheung</PERSON> is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. In the beginning, I like how she resembles the Countess (from <ORGANIZATION>Zu Warriors</ORGANIZATION>) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON>'s very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />In truth, <ORGANIZATION>Zu Warriors</ORGANIZATION> had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON> takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
806 0 Another violent, angry fantasy from <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>. <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are <PERSON>Elisabeth Shue</PERSON> and <PERSON>Josh Brolin</PERSON>, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.
807 1 I remember that the trailer for Legend of Zu was quite impressive and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (my all time favourite), Storm Riders I decided that I must watch this one too. I know that there is way to much critcism on <PERSON>Ekin Cheng</PERSON>'s acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> moviestar so far (way better than <PERSON>Nicolas Tse</PERSON> nevertheless)and he is one of the factors that I enjoyed this movie. Without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film. They must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that. The storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I guess <PERSON>Ekin Cheng</PERSON> pulls the girls easily).The story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie. I wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities, but well that's life and it never goes the way you want it to. And why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end ? That's way too funny. Legend of Zu cannot be A Man Called Hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie I will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements. Good work. Please make more fantasy movies like this
808 0 Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role. <PERSON>Elizabeth Shue</PERSON> is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due, though. Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON>'s character, <PERSON>Sebastian Caine</PERSON>. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, that has any form of self-respect to account for.
809 1 This is like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in a more surreal, fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put Industrial Light and <ORGANIZATION>Magic</ORGANIZATION> to shame. The plot may be hard to follow, but that is the nature of translating Chinese folklore to the screen; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience. However, an intelligent person should be able to keep up; moreover, the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping CGI.
810 0 This movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. There are some interesting visuals.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. True to the title.<br /><br />It's not worth picking apart the story. That's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There's not much there to begin with. It's nothing original and not very special. So don't go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great FX treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. However if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it's a sight to behold (or not to behold).<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent FX film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone.
811 1 I've been a fan of <PERSON>Xu Ke</PERSON> (Hark Tsui) for many year since school. This film is the best fantasy movie in years. I dont think "action" is the right genre, though there're lot of action and KongFu scenese. Wait, did I mentioned this is an ORIENTAL fantasy moive? please, keep in mind that DO NOT use hollywood formula to rate this film. And for the guy who "poo" around, I don't blame you, 'cause you still young and need to know more about "culture".
812 0 The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show.<br /><br /><PERSON>Gary Thompson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andrew Marlowe</PERSON> are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at "Scripts-R-Us", where you buy a standard blank "Monster Movie" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually "let's split up" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> in the end, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk.<br /><br />I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than...
813 1 this is one amazing movie!!!!! you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical. there are always stories behind stories. i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore (i studied them in school)it is very complicated. you just have to take what it gives you.....ENJOY THE MOVIE AND ENJOY THE RIDE....HOORAY!!!!
814 0 I love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen most of this movie, since it's been airing on <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> for the past couple of months. I must admit, I MAY have missed a few scenes, but I'm usually drawn into movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of "Hollow Man," I feel depressed, almost like a "film noir." I'm not sure why; perhaps it's that I don't want <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. But I think it's witnessing just HOW relentlessly evil he becomes. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are mature).
815 1 O my gosh... Just give me a minute to breath. This movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending. This is the the movie for fans of Stormriders and such. Legend of <PERSON>Zu</PERSON> was beautifully created, although I didn't like a few things, they used alot of stand ins. I wanted to see the real person fight but, oh well... a few small let downs,and I didn't really like it a lot until I watched it again, when you understand it more it totally kicks A**! I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true Asian movie, to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings.Go and see it when it comes out in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>!!!
816 0 Other than some neat special effects, this movie has nothing to offer. They threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting, but with no success. <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON>'s acting was pretty good, but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot.
817 1 I can't tell you all how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say that this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete". I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons... this movie is for you, (especially if you got into the <ORGANIZATION>Oriental Adventures</ORGANIZATION>) I'm just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. :-)
818 0 <br /><br /><PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON> finally bombed out on this one. He became a joke on himself. Once again we have a film which includes sex and violence, immorality, leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans.<br /><br />Its all for nothing. Because their is no action at all in this film. It fudges all its set pieces. All the actors give the kind of performances form a Verhoeven film. In other words rampant over acting on almost every level. <ORGANIZATION>Starship Troopers</ORGANIZATION> got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited. In this scientists are acting the same way. Sorry <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> but Soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset.<br /><br />One major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things <PERSON>Kevin Bacons</PERSON> character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens (<PERSON>Elizabeth Shue</PERSON> excepted) walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. How could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all??? Think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of story and characterisation. Then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was.<br /><br />More insulting is the Doco on the DVD where everyone is claiming that <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> is some kind of MAd Genius. Well one out of two isnt that bad.<br /><br />This film has nothing of note in it. Just like the title says.<br /><br />Hollow!!!
819 1 Legend of Zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty. This movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. The acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think you'd keep more to yourself.<br /><br />Unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic. The plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air. Legend of Zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. Allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.
820 0 Unfortunately, one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering, silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate, clichÃ©d screenplay. Hollow Man is a rather useless film.<br /><br />Practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects. However, it is just the same special effect done over and over again, and by the end of the film that has been done to death also. I was hoping before watching Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not so. It isn't long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clichÃ©s piles up so fast that it's almost impressive.<br /><br />On top of all this, <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best. Good points might be a passable <PERSON>Jerry Goldsmith</PERSON> score (but no competition for his better efforts), a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push Hollow Man's merit up one notch.<br /><br />4/10
821 1 I rented this film in DVD form without knowing anything at all about it, part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night. After several awful American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life) Zhu Warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. The story is complete nonsense, but I found the film's sincerity, good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. Sure, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. And the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.<br /><br />The characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters, offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically, several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. They play their roles straight up, without irony or guile, and so are believable.<br /><br />Most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations, I found myself very near tears at the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, good-hearted vision of the director.<br /><br />
822 0 I don't normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films I don't like, but in a case like this one, I just have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical, and stupid. There are so many flaws in the storytelling that I don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience. The most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON>'s character's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition.<br /><br />Granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON> has done some good stuff (the director's cut of Robocop on DVD is great). However, this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter, and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment.<br /><br /> In short, as many other reviews here say (wish I had read them before...) - Stay away from this film!
823 1 This movie is well done on so many levels that I am in awe that the score is as low as it is (5.9/10(576 votes) as of this writing). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic storyline, complex great character interaction, and mind-blowing battles - they have to be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I got (some lines were not translated - ???).<br /><br />I just don't understand when I read & hear from various sources: "it has a confusing plot....", "I couldn't follow the story...." or "Characters came from nowhere...". From the very 1st time I watched this movie, I understood it, followed it, knew why characters were there, and I absolutely loved it! I've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I've shown this movie to many fellow Americans (people who have never seen an HK film before) who feel the same way. Not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie. Oh man, why can't we have stuff like this coming out of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>? At least Lord of the Rings had a nice marriage of special effects, character development, and storyline.<br /><br />This is not coming from a Asian film lover newbie either. I own an extensive library of Asian films and I must say that this movie is one of my greatest DVDs. When you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave! I've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 (both done by <PERSON>Tsui Hark</PERSON>), and the 2001 is far better in comparison IMO.<br /><br />Besides the subtitles, I have one additional complaint about this movie: I didn't want it to end.... I'm begging you Mr. Hark - can we please have a sequel?
824 0 Within the realm of Science Fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success. The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic, `The <ORGANIZATION>Time Machine</ORGANIZATION>.' The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities. And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON> classic, `The Invisible Man,' the realization of which, here, is `Hollow Man,' directed by <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>, and starring <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elisabeth Shue</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Sebastian Caine</PERSON> (<PERSON>Bacon</PERSON>) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION>, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method. They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original `visual' state of being. It's a problem, however, that <PERSON>Caine</PERSON>, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks. And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.<br /><br />At the last minute, though, <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject. And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so. But something goes wrong, and <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take a toll on <PERSON>Caine</PERSON>'s mind. And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that. Now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself.<br /><br /><PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the F/X at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development. Anyone familiar with `The Invisible Man,' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> is not destined for happier times. Still, <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience. But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film. Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to <PERSON>Caine</PERSON>'s suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film. And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.<br /><br /><PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON>'s purposes perfectly. There's little depth to <ORGANIZATION>Bacon</ORGANIZATION>'s portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities. Verhoeven simply does not allow <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> the time to develop <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works. The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an F/X laden extravaganza.<br /><br /><PERSON>Elisabeth Shue</PERSON> comports herself well in the role of <PERSON>Linda McKay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Caine</PERSON>'s willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of <PERSON>Shue</PERSON>'s caliber. The same can be said of <PERSON>Kim Dickens</PERSON> (so magnificent in the 2001 film, `Things Behind the Sun'). Her character, <PERSON>Sarah Kennedy</PERSON>, does little more than support the action and F/X. Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes <PERSON>Josh Brolin</PERSON> (<PERSON>Matthew</PERSON>), <PERSON>Greg Grunberg</PERSON> (<PERSON>Carter</PERSON>), <PERSON>Joey Slotnick</PERSON> (<PERSON>Frank</PERSON>), <PERSON>Mary Randle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Janice</PERSON>) and <PERSON>William Devane</PERSON> (Dr. <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>). Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, `Hollow Man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been. Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart. And it's too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more. I rate this one 4/10.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />
825 1 I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. <PERSON>Susan Sarandon</PERSON> is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
826 0 This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression.. Story writing IS what movie making is about. <br /><br />Incredible visual effects.. Very good acting, especially from <PERSON>Shue</PERSON>. Everything is perfect.. Except.. The story is just poor and so, everything fails.<br /><br />Picture this, if you had the power to be invisible.. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON>) could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women.. This is all his supposedly "genius" mind could think of. Does he try to gain extra power? No. He doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible. The guy is basically a sex crazed maniac.<br /><br />Add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys.. Throwing around jokes like they were in a bar.. If it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of "Cheers." Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the Hollow Man's wolf.<br /><br />Even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the "thrilling" scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming "this is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me."<br /><br />If you read the actual book, while the Scientist (<ORGANIZATION>Cane</ORGANIZATION>) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character. In the movie, <ORGANIZATION>Cane</ORGANIZATION> is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it. Just sad.
827 1 Sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment. Most DeMille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives. This is followed by her and <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> being taken to the war camp and being tortured. Later comes a protracted battle with the <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION>. The whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish. <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
828 0 Going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So right away you're guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly who you'd expect them to be, so no points for plot twists there.<br /><br />And if you're not sure if this is a B-movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story, <PERSON>William Devane</PERSON> plays a part: instant B-movie status.<br /><br />The movie is promising in the beginning. At the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. Same thing when they make Bacon invisible.<br /><br />There are a couple of bare breasts, a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an R-rating that it really didn't need.<br /><br />For a thriller there weren't really any surprises, except when <PERSON>Shue</PERSON> makes like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a 'Whaaaa?' OK, there is one surprise. That's when <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> (<PERSON>Bacon</PERSON>) comes back one last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise but only because you're yelling at TV, 'Noooo! You're dead already! End the movie!' Speaking of yelling at the TV,that's all I did for the last 25 minutes or so. 'Put on your f#@%ing goggles!' Instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems...).<br /><br />The story really lost it at the end. But the special effects were good; that's the only reason I give it a 2/10.
829 1 <PERSON>Cecil B. deMille</PERSON> really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western comes across as the Real <PERSON>McCoy</PERSON>, engrossing, entertaining, spectacular; in no way outdated.<br /><br />As a real fan of TV's DEADWOOD, I'll tell you the performances of <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> as <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Arthor</PERSON> as Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> are far more on-target.<br /><br />We don't have any giants in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> anymore. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade: released, re-issued, re-issued all over again. Filmmakers like today's <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bruckheimer</PERSON> are like kids playing in a sandbox. None of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years.
830 0 Leave it to <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> "sex on the brain" Verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he'd direct a Pokemon film, I'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts. I don't mind sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but frankly, it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it. It's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> grope women. <br /><br />The game cast of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them, including <PERSON>William Devane</PERSON>, who is totally wasted here.<br /><br />But then what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is much more entertaining than this stilted & bad film.
831 1 The master of movie spectacle <PERSON>Cecil B. De Mille</PERSON> goes West. Using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never met),<PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> is portraying <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickock</PERSON>,<PERSON>James Ellison</PERSON> as <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> does make a nice Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>. The story serves only for <PERSON>De Mille</PERSON> to hang some marvelous action sequences on, like the big Indian attack.Scenes like that are extremely well done.If you don't mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western.Look out for a very young <PERSON>Anthony Quinn</PERSON> essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big Horn.This part got him at least noticed in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>.
832 0 (some spoilers) - as if you wouldn't know how it'll end<br /><br />My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON> and actors like <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elisabeth Shue</PERSON>, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every premise for a great movie was accomplished. Unfortunately these things didn't matter at all. The movie was very very week, without suspense and awfully predictable. <br /><br />It's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals succeeded, <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> decides to test it on himself. Once he's invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there's a very thin line.<br /><br />Hollow Man is an ill movie. It suffers of the disease that many new movies have: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. Actually that's the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.<br /><br />After Starship Troopers, <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> disappoints again. In stead of a great film, HM is cr*p. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> and Wonder Woman (i won't spoil this moment for you...)<br /><br />Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what i can remember.<br /><br />--- It's not tensed at all. It should've been, but it's not.<br /><br />--- It's too predictable . You know from the beginning who will die and who will live.<br /><br />--- In stead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects.<br /><br />--- Very many cliches. <br /><br />--- Of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying.<br /><br />--- Just like in every low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is somebody alone in the lab, perfect victim for Bacon.<br /><br />--- Some holes in the plot. Example: at the beginning, <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he's invisible, how can he do that?<br /><br />--- The ending: absolutely horrible.<br /><br />--- After <PERSON>Shue</PERSON> hits <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> in the head, <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> falls down to the ground. Then <PERSON>Shue</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brolin</PERSON> leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then <PERSON>Bacon</PERSON> gets up, attacks them, they "kill" him again. And then <PERSON>Shue</PERSON> screams "I heard an explosion" (happened minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Didn't she hear that explosion some time before?<br /><br />--- There's a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven , i expected much more from you!<br /><br />So that's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /><br />Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)
833 1 The Plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, which is actual even today. <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> is <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickok</PERSON>, ideal for the role, together with <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation. <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> is great as Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>, nobody that I know played it better than her. Even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about <PERSON>Hickok</PERSON> and about the time it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice History to make your point and that is what <PERSON>DeMille</PERSON> does here. The friendship of <PERSON>Hickok</PERSON> with <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>, the selling of rifles to the Indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war, <PERSON>Custer</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Little Big Horn</LOCATION>, the uneasy relationship between <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>'s wife, a religious woman, with <PERSON>Hickok</PERSON> a man who had killed plenty, also the unusual love affair between <PERSON>Hickok</PERSON> and Calamity all this makes 'The Plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film. <PERSON>Anthony Quinn</PERSON> has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become. A lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time.
834 0 I get to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check out this site, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on a film.<br /><br />To my all time list of shockingly bad films - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the drivel that was 'Hollow Man'.<br /><br />From the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal, and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end.<br /><br />This isn't just my opinion - it was that of my friends, and everyone around us. When large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless.<br /><br />Not only that, it was sick too. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked B-movie. It's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema.<br /><br />[spoilers follow]<br /><br />Get past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. Whilst <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man', the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast. One long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, "He's finally snapped" shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. They pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> chief, "He drowned in his pool last night" reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together.<br /><br />The script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an A-Z of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end.<br /><br />The 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy.<br /><br />The invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches.<br /><br />That this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one, which should be avoided at all costs.
835 1 This movie has Wild <PERSON>Bill Hickok</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Calamity Jane</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON> and General <PERSON>Custer</PERSON> all together. <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Wild Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> plays Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Bickford</PERSON> plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> is in love with <PERSON>Wild Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON> has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with <PERSON>Custer</PERSON>'s last stand and is far from accurate. <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> is good as usual and i usually don't like <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> but i liked her here.
836 0 One could wish that an idea as good as the "invisible man" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.<br /><br />There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, "Hollow Man" is seriously undermined with clichÃ©s, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.<br /><br />However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go "Oh darn!" and "Oh my God". "Hollow Man" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON> for that.
837 1 This a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level.However if your after the true facts about such legends as <PERSON>Hickcock</PERSON>,<PERSON>Cody</PERSON> and Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> then look elsewhere, as <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON> suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend.The story moves with a cracking pace, and there is some great dialogue between <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> two very watchable stars who help to make this movie.The sharp eyed amongst you might just spot <PERSON>Gabby Hayes</PERSON> as an Indian scout, also there is a very young <PERSON>Anthony Quinn</PERSON> making his debut as Cayenne warrior, he actually married one of <LOCATION>Demilles</LOCATION> daughters in real life.Indeed its Quinns character who informs <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> of the massacre of <PERSON>Custer</PERSON> told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the American west with American history.So please take time out to watch this classic western.
838 0 The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible. Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like child's play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Sebastian Caine</PERSON>, a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah, I know that's not a word) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah, I know, I used that non-word again) process. The process has dire consequences, no <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he's invisible, <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> stalks a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> (<PERSON>Elisabeth Shue</PERSON>), and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> becomes a new supernatural being, "The Thing That Won't Die." Laughing in the face of all things natural, <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> faces down death and spits in it's face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.
839 1 This <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON> epic of the old West contains what may be <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON>'s finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>. She really pulled it off! <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'The plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.' The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for <PERSON>Jesse James</PERSON>. Even <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> opens the story in person (or at least, <PERSON>DeMille</PERSON> would have us believe so). There is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety, this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses. A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'. It isn't just a story about gun-runners, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. But let's not get into politics, let's leave that to <PERSON>DeMille</PERSON>, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by <PERSON>George Antheil</PERSON>, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'Bad Boy of Music'. <PERSON>Antheil</PERSON> seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent Westerns, whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. That is why it does not sound at all unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into American mythic lore, and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then, corny as it may be, but doubtless appropriate. It is amusing to see <PERSON>Anthony Quinn</PERSON> in an early appearance as a <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> Indian. <PERSON>Gabby Hayes</PERSON> is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?
840 0 For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
841 1 This film provides the saga of a legendary <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickock</PERSON>. He, <PERSON>Buffalo Bill Cody</PERSON>, and Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>, are the central characters.<br /><br />As the Civil War closes, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, "Go West, young man," which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to <PERSON>Horace Greeley</PERSON>, as a number of others did. But then, he gets assassinated, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians.<br /><br />In the meantime, we see <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickock</PERSON>, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Wild Bill</PERSON> uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an "<ORGANIZATION>Arkansas Toothpick</ORGANIZATION>," which in reality was a different type of knife, though both were used throughout the frontier.<br /><br /><PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> eventually meets <PERSON>Buffalo Bill Cody</PERSON>, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> has just gotten married, and is bringing his bride to the <LOCATION>Old West</LOCATION> to settle down.<br /><br />When they arrive at their destination, they run into Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>, who has a crush on <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON>. She looks at <PERSON>Cody</PERSON>'s wife, and asks <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>, "Is this your mopsy?" The line was one that caused the <ORGANIZATION>Hayes Board</ORGANIZATION> some problem, since one definition of "mopsy" was prostitute. <PERSON>Demille</PERSON> wanted the line in, and one of his aides pointed out that in <PERSON>Beatrix Potter</PERSON>'s books about <PERSON>Peter Rabbit</PERSON>, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, <PERSON>Mopsy</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Cottontail</PERSON>. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of ill virtue." It worked; the line stayed in.<br /><br />The Indians were getting restless, in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers. <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> were asked to help scout the area, so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> led the troops; <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> went to check out the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile Indians.<br /><br />Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> gets captured, and <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> gets captured trying to save her. They are brought to the chief, and although neither would talk, torture applied to <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> breaks Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>'s willpower, and she tells the route <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> is using.<br /><br />The two are released, and <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> joins up with <PERSON>Cody</PERSON> and his forces, in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. With <PERSON>Hickok</PERSON>'s help, they hold off the Indian attack.<br /><br /><PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoner. As they're waiting for authorities, <PERSON>Hickock</PERSON> is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.<br /><br />There are numerous historic anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.
842 0 My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Planet Earth" , which I am sure most of you have , then you are not gonna like this movie too much. And I own all the discs of "Planet Earth" I had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out.<br /><br />Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> movie with production companies listing <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at home of "Planet Earth".<br /><br />The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from "Planet Earth".<br /><br />We were very very disappointed , as I think 90% of the footage is from "Planet Earth" . I am saying 90% , because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them.<br /><br />So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of "Planet Earth" , with a narration aimed at kids. Yes, the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says "The polar cubs are not like human kids. They don't always listen to their mothers" ( I don't remember the exact words , but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell. This is condensed "Planet Earth" for kids !
843 1 After the failure of "The Crusades" at the box office, <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON> stopped doing films about non-American history. His films for the next thirteen years were about our history from <PERSON>Jean Lafitte</PERSON> to World War II (Dr. <PERSON>Wassell</PERSON>). The first in order of production was this film, starring <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> as <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickok</PERSON>, with <PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON> as Calamity <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>. <PERSON>James Ellison</PERSON> was <PERSON>Buffalo Bill</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Miljan</PERSON> (not a villain as usual) was General <PERSON>George A. Custer</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Anthony Quinn</PERSON> was one of the Indians who fought at <LOCATION>Little Big Horn</LOCATION>. The villains were led by <PERSON>Charles Bickford</PERSON> (selling arms to the Indians) and <LOCATION>Porter Hall</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Jack McCall</PERSON> (who killed <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickok</PERSON>).<br /><br />Basically the film takes up the history of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> after the Civil War. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> has surrendered. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> talks about the need to secure the west (more about this point later). Then he announces he has to go to the theater. That April 14th must have been very busy for Abe - in "<LOCATION>Virginia City</LOCATION>" he grants a pardon to <PERSON>Errol Flynn</PERSON> at the request of <PERSON>Miriam Hopkins</PERSON> on the same date.<br /><br />Actually, while <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was concerned about the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, his immediate thoughts on the last day of his Presidency were about reunifying the former Confederate states and it's citizens into the Union as soon as possible. It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of <PERSON>Maximillian</PERSON> and his French controlled forces in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> against Juarez). But he had been involved in actual problems with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. In 1862 he sent disgraced General <PERSON>John Pope</PERSON>, the loser at <LOCATION>Second Manassas</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to put down a serious Indian war by the <LOCATION>Sioux</LOCATION> (the subject of <PERSON>McKinley Kantor</PERSON>'s novel, "<LOCATION>Sprit Lake</LOCATION>". <PERSON>Pope</PERSON>, incompetent against <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, turned out to be quite effective here, and the revolt was smashed.<br /><br />However, with all <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> repeats at least once), "The frontier should be secure." There is nothing to say he could not have said it, but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman. Like saying, <PERSON>Teddy Roosevelt</PERSON> said, "Eat a good breakfast every morning for your health." It is not a profound statement of policy. It is, at best, a statement of recognizable fact. <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> turning it into a minor mantra, like <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s version of the Monroe Doctrine, is ridiculous...typical of the way DeMille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them.<br /><br />However, this is not a ruinous mistake. "The Plainsman" is an adventure film, and as such it has the full benefit of <PERSON>DeMille</PERSON> the film creator of spectacle. As such it is well worth watching. But not as a textbook on <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s political ideas or his quotable legacy.
844 0 A lot of death happens in the wild. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film! <br /><br />And, why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money?<br /><br />Then in typical, comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent Birds-of-Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of First and Second graders on a school field trip! Wow! From the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat!<br /><br />If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration, instead?
845 1 "The Plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON> at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than <PERSON>Wild Bill Hickok</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON>), <PERSON>Buffalo Bill Cody</PERSON> (<PERSON>James Ellison</PERSON>), <PERSON>Calamity Jane</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jean Arthur</PERSON>), <PERSON>George Armstrong Custer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> to interact, even though in reality <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress <PERSON>Custer</PERSON>'s last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good Â– just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt Â– in some cases Â– a whole box seems more appropriate!
846 0 i don't know why, but after all the hype on <ORGANIZATION>NPR</ORGANIZATION> i thought this was a new movie.....all the best footage has been used for <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs...it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> to take advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader.......oops,........... <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> speak, but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film......it has been sanitized for a child audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube ....i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as <PERSON>Koyannisquatsi</PERSON> (sic) and this movie is certainly not it
847 1 I just read the plot summary and it is the worst one I have ever read. It does not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the listing at "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a young child. My sister and I couldn't wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse movies of it's time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The romance is clean and endearing. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They don't make movies like this anymore. Good acting and not over the top. <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shirley Jones</PERSON> are at their best, along with many other great character actors.
848 0 Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and other countries, and I went to see the full-feature movie-version of "Earth" by DisneyNature. I guess, like the auto manufacturers, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really do care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think it warrants a special unit with the word "nature" in it. I do know that my youngest daughter loves <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON>, and who am I to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about <PERSON>Disney</PERSON>? <br /><br />Aside from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Preceded by a half-dozen <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> movie trailers, rife with <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> clichÃ© ("circle of life", "falling with style"), over-dramatic music, recycled footage (<ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> claims "40% new footage"). I was even starting to think that <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> narration is getting a bit boring. I like <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>, but his work for <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Morgan Freeman</PERSON> doing every <ORGANIZATION>Warner Brothers</ORGANIZATION> narrative starts to wear thin. I really think that <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> bought some <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it.<br /><br />And what is <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals? There were a half-dozen such scenes, complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out. I think <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents. I was also cognizant of how <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change. Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it's still a controversial subject? <br /><br />I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on <ORGANIZATION>Netflix</ORGANIZATION>. Nature films seem to be best done by the British at the moment.
849 1 I love this movie because I grew up around harness racing. <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON> behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because, unlike thoroughbred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /><br />Yes, the 1944 Home in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, a feel good movie. (Disappointing though that <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON>'s religious/moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl! Quite a change from today's standard fare.) Home in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> (filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song) captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment.
850 0 I can't believe I am so angry after seeing this that I am about to write my first ever review on IMDb.<br /><br />This Disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed <LOCATION>Planet Earth</LOCATION> lite. Now I knew going into this that it was advertised as "from the people who brought you Planet Earth," but I had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini-series. I just paid $8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save a <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> voice-over and 90 seconds of sailfish that I don't believe were in <LOCATION>Planet Earth</LOCATION>).<br /><br />But the biggest crime of all, is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe. After the male polar bear's demise, they show his cubs grown significantly a year later, and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory, and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all. No mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured, no warning of trouble for future generations if we don't get our act together, nothing. Just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie (and many times more, if you are one of the billion people who have already seen Planet Earth).<br /><br />I have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life.
851 1 I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favorites because my father, <PERSON>Nelson Malone</PERSON> plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> came to <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>KY</LOCATION>, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and lo and behold he came home w/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON> is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus...
852 0 Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning, and the material is dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and I actually left very angry at what <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> had done.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Planet Earth</LOCATION> was all of the above and more. It was subtle. It had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s edit of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is none of this. They tried to make it a movie us Americans would talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They put an over the top musical score there to frighten us. They made predators evil. They made WALRUSES evil. They showed every encounter as negative. It tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson of balance. The movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive.<br /><br />I am all for preventing global warning, but this was over the top political and environmental junk.<br /><br />That's another thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but was disappointed in the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home.<br /><br />If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>'s Planet Earth series. It is better lessons, better sound, and (if you have Blu-Ray)better picture quality.
853 1 Having ran across this film on the <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can think of no better way to spend a lazy Friday evening then putting in my two cents worth. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it. Doesn't every movie, good or bad deserve more than four comments? And this movie isn't bad at all.<br /><br />The first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like April Love is to remember the era from which it came, in this case the late fifties. Films were pretty much a happy medium back then. The cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen Technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television. I don't know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one, but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes.<br /><br />Teen Idol <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Nick Conover</PERSON>, a young teen sent to live with his Aunt <PERSON>Henrietta</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jeanette Nolan</PERSON>) and Uncle <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> (<PERSON>Arthur O'Connell</PERSON>) out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car. It seems that his Aunt and Uncle have lost their own son (<PERSON>Jed Jr.</PERSON>)so Uncle <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> seems has lost his zest for living. Aunt <PERSON>Henrietta</PERSON> is hoping that <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> being on the farm will somehow bring <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> out of his doldrums. Story lines like this being what they are, <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> don't really care for each other too much of course. <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors, Fran (<PERSON>Dolores Michaels</PERSON>)and <PERSON>Liz</PERSON> (<PERSON>Shirley Jones</PERSON>)<ORGANIZATION>Templeton</ORGANIZATION>. Immediately <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> develops a crush on Fran, and of course I don't have to tell you that <PERSON>Liz</PERSON> develops a crush on <PERSON>Jed</PERSON>. Then there's the matter of Uncle <PERSON>Jed</PERSON>'s horse, a trotter who has turned wild and won't let anyone handle him since the death of <PERSON>Jed Jr</PERSON>. You could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own, seeing as how there are no real surprises. Doesn't matter though, you'll enjoy yourself anyway.<br /><br />Once you get over the image of squeaky clean <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON>, as a supposedly bad boy, you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film. Considering that, <PERSON>Boone</PERSON> does turn in a surprisingly good performance as <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>. Certainly the role doesn't require much depth, but still it's a nicely done job when you would least expect it. As <PERSON>Jed</PERSON>, <PERSON>Arthur O'Connell</PERSON> is the perfect choice for the role. In the early going, he is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly warms up to <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>, we see that he's really a pretty good guy. <PERSON>Jeannette Nolan</PERSON> is a lot of fun as <PERSON>Henrietta</PERSON>, who is constantly playing the part of mediator between <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>. <PERSON>Shirley Jones</PERSON> takes a break from Rodgers And <PERSON>Hammerstein</PERSON> and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents. As <PERSON>Liz</PERSON>, she's gorgeous to look at, great to listen to, and quite funny at times. <PERSON>Dolores Michaels</PERSON> as Fran, who is a bit more on the wild side, is equally entertaining.<br /><br />The best thing about April Love, is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen. Not one true villain in the whole thing. Everybody is so darn likable you can't help but enjoy the film. I truthfully find it quite refreshing, sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old <PERSON>Andy Griffith</PERSON> show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and wide screen Technicolor. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really liked is that they didn't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences, and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it. As a matter of fact, you'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn't skimp in that department. The chemistry between <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boone</PERSON> is good. Best of all is how the dislike between <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jed</PERSON> is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect.<br /><br />This movie will never be confused with great cinema. Yet, sometimes instead of going to <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, one just needs a nice outing in the park, and that's what April Love is.<br /><br />My Grade: B+<br /><br />

855 1 one of the best ensemble acted films I've ever seen. There isn't much to the plot, but the acting- incredible. You see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, and love. And happiness. The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. Truly "enchanted".
856 0 Wow, a movie about NYC politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in NYC. You know there's a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour. The characters are boring, <PERSON>John Cusack</PERSON>'s accent is laughable, and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable. A horrible movie.
857 1 Two women, sick of their controlling husbands, taking a vacation in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for a month with two other very different women.They come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by Merchant - Ivory.<br /><br />Great scenery and the location isn't bad either. Seriously, a very good period piece 7 of 10
858 0 I was lured to see this movie by its starpower, but ultimately that's all it delivers. It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption. It's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and just follow along as they fall like dominoes. The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to substitute good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good, flat decaffeinated diet cola. "Q&A", which also takes place in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, is a far better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".
859 1 It has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism. The only two movies I can think of is "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both movies used wonderful actors not stars. In both movies, all the actors gave their best romantic performances.<br /><br />"Enchanted April" is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> while on vacation. It is amazing "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It stands out as an enjoyable classic.
860 0 Wow. This is really not that good. <br /><br />I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good... it is, but it is nothing special.<br /><br />The movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies.<br /><br />*/****
861 1 This was a very good film. I didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the script, and the scenery. <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON> was fantastic and so was <PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON>. They stole the show. But the other actors played their parts wonderfully also. Very enjoyable film.
862 0 Admittedly, I find <PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON> to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film, of which I'd heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. It's not.<br /><br />City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and "realistic" citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. In truth, however, these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as <ORGANIZATION>Corruption of Power</ORGANIZATION>, Two-Faced Politicians, <ORGANIZATION>Mafia</ORGANIZATION> with Police ties, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! But again, it really doesn't.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we're left with several "confession" monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. I don't think we're left with that in <LOCATION>City Hall</LOCATION>, and while it's a very full film, I don't find it altogether rich.
863 1 It starts slowly, showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for the month of April, but don't give up on it. Nothing much happens, but the time passes exquisitely, and there are numerous sly jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious). The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as is <PERSON>Polly Walker</PERSON>), and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying.<br /><br />The movie takes a couple of liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot/Briggs/Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this (it may be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like sentiment when it's well done).<br /><br />An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather.
864 0 This movie had the potential to be far more than it was. But it not only fails to deliver, it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time.<br /><br /><PERSON>John Cusack</PERSON> is even flatter than he was in Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times each scene.<br /><br /><PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON> does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck. He's good as usual but hardly standout.<br /><br />Supporting cast -- throw in female romantic interest which added little, if anything, to the story. Speaking of the story, a convoluted "who really cares" tale where <PERSON>Cusack</PERSON> is the self-righteous Mayor's boy who just has to search for "the right thing" to be done.<br /><br />People don't act this way. <PERSON>Cusack</PERSON>'s character loses all credibility at the end, of which without revealing it, is preach and nauseous. The final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound. It's also completely inaccurate but I won't get into law.<br /><br />This is a bad, by the numbers movie. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy, proselytizing, self-righteous film for the last hour. Better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk.
865 1 I only watched this because it starred <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>, who I knew<br /><br />from Whose Line is it Anyway?, the wacky British improvisational<br /><br />comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem. It is uplifting, touching, and<br /><br />romantic without being sappy or sentimental. The characters are<br /><br />all real people, with real foibles, fears and needs. See it.!
866 0 This film is predictable; it is more predictable then a <PERSON>Vinnie Testaverdi</PERSON> pass, when he huts the ball for the Jets. One saw the ending coming up halfway through the film. The politics reminds me when I was back east. Many people know when the fix is in. I gave this four because of the acting, but the story is lame.
867 1 This is one of those rare movies, it's lovely and compelling, dignified and quirky, a true gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience (yup, find the magic). I especially loved <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Lottie Wilkins</PERSON>, but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film. Further the costumes, if you're drawn to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done. I just wish they'd release it on DVD because I'm wearing my tape version out! <br /><br />Absolutely well worth your time, just make sure to settle in to watch it, without any interruptions.
868 0 Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious.<br /><br />When a <ORGANIZATION>Jehovah Witness</ORGANIZATION> reject gets his own documentary on movies Â– or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, say, <PERSON>Paris Hilton</PERSON> (I know, not too difficult) <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. Example: there are three main <PERSON>Marx</PERSON> brothers hence what a "great" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. I'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from "Snowhite" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of <LOCATION>Gahannah</LOCATION> (Moslem hell). It's like the premise of <PERSON>Schumacher</PERSON>'s "The Number 23": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess <PERSON>Di</PERSON>'s death.<br /><br />However, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other madhouse drama when you can have <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions.<br /><br />I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like "Birds" this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them Â– unless one is a complete idiot. <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in <LOCATION>Slovenia</LOCATION> these days...<br /><br />When <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> showed the bathtub hole in the "Psycho" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in <PERSON>Janet Leigh</PERSON>'s blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON>'s vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation), this representing some kind of "clever (Zizekian) irony". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script), his movies wouldn't have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about "hidden, deep meanings". And when you add <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible.<br /><br /><PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates <PERSON>Anthony Perkins</PERSON>'s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with "the satisfaction of work, of a job well done". Don't laugh... Neither <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> nor the writer of "Psycho" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that <PERSON>Perkins</PERSON> might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. Talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to "say".<br /><br />I like <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s initial thoughts on <PERSON>Tarkovsky</PERSON>'s terrific "Solaris", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory.<br /><br /><PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. "I just want to play with it all day!" Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal "2001"s.<br /><br />The fact that <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON>, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised <PERSON>De Palma</PERSON> didn't feature more prominently; that's another lame director who writes inept scripts. <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> has a field day with <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON>'s incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it.<br /><br /><PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s comment that the viewer readily accepts von <PERSON>Trier</PERSON>'s laughable, "ground-breaking" physical set-up in "Dogville" made me snicker. <br /><br />However, <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the "bleedin' obvious". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite "observations" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.<br /><br />I was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit...<br /><br /><PERSON>Slavoj Zizek</PERSON>: soon as a stalker in a kid's park near you.<br /><br />http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
869 1 Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male, I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own "thing" that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn't try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the <PERSON>Alfred Molina</PERSON> character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.
870 0 An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. You get your <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>, your <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON>, your <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> and some other stuff prior to the 80ies. To disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days, he throws in The Matrix.<br /><br />But it's not only the same lame film-as-art speech all over again. This speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /><br />It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having <PERSON>Zizte</PERSON> edited into the movies he is taking about. For someone who is supposed to know much about movies, his own is, cinematographicly speaking: yeiks.<br /><br />To put it in <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s own words - I saw 5\-\!7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />Mr. (<PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on your soul.
871 1 Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR?). Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination. But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it. My mind was changed by <PERSON>Elizbeth Von Arnim</PERSON>'s original book. My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form. Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds. Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor. If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you. But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films.<br /><br />It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar. In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes. (Perhaps <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from <PERSON>Boccaccio</PERSON>'s Decameron on TV.) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. Great credit is due to the Director, <PERSON>Mike Newell</PERSON>, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.
872 0 If you've ever been harassed on the Underground by a Christian who says, "<PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> is the answer. What's the question?", then perhaps you should thank God if you've never met a Lacanian. <PERSON>Slavoj Zizek</PERSON>, the most evangelical of Lacanians, would surely exchange the word "Jesus" in that statement for "Lacan/Hegel".<br /><br /><PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s star burns brightly at the moment, no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption. So it seems impressive when someone - anyone - comes along and says, "Hang on, films may say something about ourselves."<br /><br />The ideas <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> expounds in this film are "true" purely because he says so. For example, <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> explains that three <PERSON>Marx Bros</PERSON> are the ego, superego and id (God knows what happened to <PERSON>Zeppo</PERSON>, or Gummo Â… perhaps they're the sinthome...or is that movies themselves?). This is simply what they are. In <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s output, culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology. People may object that he certainly has something to say - but how different is what he says from the Christian attributing everything to God's will?<br /><br />What's wrong with taking examples, from films or anywhere, to illustrate theory? Well, nothing at all. As <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> seems to believe, they may even serve as a proof. However, it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context. Without context, you can say and prove anything you want. For <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lacan</PERSON> is the answer Â– so he goes and makes an example of it. Everything but everything resembles the teachings of the Master and culture is there to bear this out, to serve this ideology. For instance, <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in <LOCATION>Vertigo</LOCATION> when <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> spies on <PERSON>Kim Novak</PERSON> in a flower shop. But, in the context of the film, this is not a voyeur's fantasy position at all. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> has been deliberately led there by <PERSON>Novak</PERSON>. This presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s two hour and a half cinematic sermon.<br /><br />His analysis of the "baby wants to f---" scene in Blue Velvet is laughable. Touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific (to the masculine) truth of "feminine jouissance", <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Isabella Rossilini</PERSON>'s character not only demands her degradation but is, unconsciously, in charge of the situation. This is an example of her "jouissance". Well ... possibly. But - sorry to be prosaic - where is the evidence for this? In the film, she partially undergoes her humiliations because <PERSON>Hopper</PERSON> has kidnapped her son. <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with <PERSON>Kyle MacLachalan</PERSON>. But this may be due to any number of things. Isn't that the point of so-called feminine "jouissance"? According to <PERSON>Lacan</PERSON>, feminine jouissance, unlike phallic jouissance, cannot be articulated, it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language. If this is right, then no example can be made of it. It also means that the entire concept is non-sensical and entirely mystical. It can only be designated by dogmatists such as <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>: "There's feminine jouissance for you! Why is this feminine jouissance? Because I say so." <br /><br />What example can really be garnered from these films? Only <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s psychology. Why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films, even to the point that, when in a boat on <LOCATION>Botega Bay</LOCATION>, he says he wants to f--- <PERSON>Rod Steiger</PERSON> too? Is this not the wish-fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films? As the saying goes, <PERSON>Freud</PERSON> would have a field day with The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema - but with <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> himself, nobody else.<br /><br /><PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it, but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws. This film illustrates how <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> desires and only extremely vaguely - as to be almost useless - how the rest of us desire. For, as any psychoanalyst knows, how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated - and cannot be easily universalised, if at all. <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s love of making everything an example of <PERSON>Lacan</PERSON>'s Answer bears this out: how do we desire? like this, this is how I do it. Problem is, in <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s desire, everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire. But <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> is a Leninist and they certainly don't like letting the "subject" speak for itself.<br /><br />The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is a summation <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political (what dogma isn't?). <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis, what he is trying to discover, because the terms of his exploration, and therefore his ethics in doing so, are never put into question.<br /><br /><PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing. He's a kind of <PERSON>Henry Ford</PERSON> of cultural theory: mass-production and any colour as long as it's black. He is perfect for today's highly consumerist society: supposedly critical while giving people the same c-ap over and over and pretending that it is something different. This is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems - which capitalism always claims to provide - rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all. Which is kind of like being brain dead. For me, <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule.<br /><br />PS: I loved <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON>'s solemn remark - presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity - that music in films can greatly affect people's sympathies. Did this only occur to <PERSON>Zizek</PERSON> after he watched Jaws?
873 1 I absolutely loved this movie. I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time. This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it. I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available.
874 0 (Spoilers)<br /><br />I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt.<br /><br />The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things.<br /><br />First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull.<br /><br />Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable.<br /><br />Too bad.
875 1 Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently, I am not alone.<br /><br />If parent company <ORGANIZATION>Amazon</ORGANIZATION>'s listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
876 0 This is an "anthology" horror film. It's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of <PERSON>Robert Bloch</PERSON> (who wrote for Weird Tales and was personal friends with <ORGANIZATION>H.P. Lovecraft</ORGANIZATION>, but is most famous for the original story "Psycho"). The quality of the stories is very uneven and I didn't think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all. It would have been better to do it as a comedy like "Comedy of Terrors." Only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way, and it's probably the best of them (the one with <PERSON>Ingrid Pitt</PERSON>). I've seen a few of these Amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was <PERSON>Freddie Francis</PERSON>' "Tales from the Crypt." The anthology style works well for the producers, because it means that they can hire a bunch of "big name" actors, employ them for only one week of shooting or so, and then bring in the next big name. So you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee. But that's very unfortunate for the audience, because the audience would like to see some scenes with <PERSON>Peter Cushing</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christopher Lee</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Ingrid Pitt</PERSON> actually acting together. Instead they're stuck in these vignettes by themselves. So let's take them one at a time, briefly.<br /><br />The first story has <PERSON>Denholm Elliot</PERSON>, who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character. Unfortunately the actor who plays <PERSON>Dominic</PERSON>, the source of the horror, <PERSON>Tom Adams</PERSON>, just looks silly which ruins any possible horror. There's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though, like the scene where <PERSON>Dominic</PERSON> kills <PERSON>Elliot</PERSON>'s psychiatrist. It's the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching, so the whole audience is supposed to shout out "LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU!" The second story is the one with <PERSON>Peter Cushing</PERSON>. God I love that man so much. Too bad so many of his films, like this one, pretty much stink. In the story he's supposed to be pining away for a long-lost love, and he sees her likeness in a wax museum. It's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere.<br /><br />Then you have the bit with <PERSON>Christopher Lee</PERSON>, where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch. Again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs. But instead we're supposed to be horrified when <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil. The actress, <PERSON>Chloe Franks</PERSON>, was pretty good in that type of "Bad Seed" role though.<br /><br />The last story is kind of amusing... <PERSON>Ingrid Pitt</PERSON> plays an actress and <PERSON>Jon Pertwee</PERSON> plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire. That's about all the story has to offer. I was surprised at how bad <PERSON>Ingrid Pitt</PERSON>'s English is, I guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films I've seen her in.<br /><br />Not a very memorable film or one that I would recommend to anyone but horror completists.

878 0 Just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered its star from the old <PERSON>Dick Van Dyke</PERSON> Show. <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON>, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, never was much of an actor at all (by his own admission) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. His talentless real life son <PERSON>Barry</PERSON>, a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father, plays his son in the series.
879 1 The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) at the end.<br /><br />By that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success. As a film in general, it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations. In short the film is, well, enchanting. Although all the performances are first-rate, three must be <PERSON>mentioned-Josie Lawrence</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Broadbent</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON>. It says something when <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON> does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast. Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart. Further Deponent Saith Not.
880 0 ** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /><br />Recap: <PERSON>Mia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Helin</PERSON>) is returning home from capital <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> to rural RÃ¤ttvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters <PERSON>Eivor</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Ernst</ORGANIZATION>) and <PERSON>Gunilla</PERSON> (PetrÃ©n). <PERSON>Eivor</PERSON> has a family and still lives in RÃ¤ttvik and <PERSON>Gunilla</PERSON> has divorced and moved a town away. <PERSON>Mia</PERSON> is still single and is focused on her career. There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle. As the party goes on (and alcohol consumed), more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise...<br /><br />Comments: To be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This movie draws upon three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves. 2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety. This move has the focus on the last one, almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. No loss though, since the humor that is there is not funny. The performances from the cast are good I guess, though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this.<br /><br />3/10
881 1 My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between <PERSON>Lady Caroline</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Briggs</PERSON> in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer <PERSON>Peter Barnes</PERSON>, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director <PERSON>Mike Newell</PERSON> and cinematographer <PERSON>Rex Maidment</PERSON>. It is <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>'s best work by far, and transformed my opinion of <PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON>. Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it. The music, by famed composer <PERSON>Richard Rodney Bennet</PERSON> is a marvel.
882 0 We don't have this on television in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> but I walked it over the Internet on <ORGANIZATION>YouTube</ORGANIZATION>. It's dumb, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>" <PERSON>Douglas TenNapel</PERSON>, I never got into that cartoon but I must admit it better than this. The cartoonist hasn't done anything for years since now. For <PERSON>Doug TenNapel</PERSON>, this is a comeback travesty and an all time low! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master. They are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The animation is dreadful. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they don't look nothing like cats! Just weird animal monster-looking creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and bulgy eyes! The human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show got 7.5/10 votes of other IMDb viewers. Television really isn't what is used to be! But now most of them is dumb, cheaply made and boring. Some of you on the website might not agree with me well I'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> don't have too tolerate this crap (oh yeah, if you have digital you have to) but I don't, so it not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get that because I've given other shows worst!).
883 1 This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life. The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see. It isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted. The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format. It deserved <ORGANIZATION>Todd-AO</ORGANIZATION>, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available.(An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter.) The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. I can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite. The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often.<br /><br />The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is above reproach. It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness. Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you. If you don't get it, perhaps you haven't lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.
884 0 This game was made by <ORGANIZATION>Sega</ORGANIZATION>. Being made by <ORGANIZATION>Sega</ORGANIZATION> I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this junk either. For starters the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the worst part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move. You never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter. The main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy impossible. This game wouldn't even be worth renting.
885 1 This is what I call a growth movie. Every character is different and better at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men. The book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery breath-taking and the message of love genuine.
886 0 Overall an extremely disappointing picture. Very, very slow build up to the basic storyline. The role of <PERSON>Maria Schrader</PERSON> searching for her families secret past. (Every take seems to last foreverÂ…. There is really no rhythm in the film.) ***SPOILERS*** Her Mother <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is rescued from the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>, by a German woman, played by <PERSON>Katja Riemann</PERSON>. The entire character of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is so one dimensional, so stereotypical. ***SPOILERS END*** The film cuts back and forth between present day <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> 40s something. Please when you do that, give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place. There is never a clear indication of time Â– very annoying. Worst part is, the end. ***SPOILERS*** The entire show and jabber about the Jews being so terribly tormented, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. That's how the Jews got out of the Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is NEVER answered. Was is Goebels who freed them? Did Lean <PERSON>Fischer</PERSON> sleep with Goebels? In <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> the film won an acting award for <PERSON>K. Riemann</PERSON>, why? Â– I have no idea. Must be the Jewish themeÂ…
887 1 I first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released. Room With a View was also newly out. Enchanted April had so much more to offer! I found it much more real and earthy, the characters more believable for being 'normal'. By the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> production of Pride and Prejudice, I was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation, peace, liberty or love. You get a sense throughout that <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting. But in the heat of the spring in April, everyone's lives loosen and unravel (in line with the Victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. What a little gem of a film! How come it isn't more well known?
888 0 (SPOILERS IN THIS)<br /><br />"RosenstraÃŸe" is a movie about heroic women in German Nazi time. But it is way too long, it is not touching and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichÃ©s and not enough good acting.<br /><br />The storytelling (storyline) is bad. Like in James CameronÂ´s Titanic an old woman remembers events of her live. Good, now weÂ´ve got a point of view. Than there is another woman introduced who does the same. Confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling...How can <PERSON>Riemann</PERSON> know about the fate of the little girlÂ´s mother and her interrogation for example?<br /><br />The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place. For example the scene when <PERSON>Riemann</PERSON> is proposing to <PERSON>Fabian</PERSON>. When did that happen? The scene looks like it is set in the Twenties...<br /><br />RiemannÂ´s character is of course a talented pianist, well, she is even a Baroness! Wow. Her brother comes back from the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Front</ORGANIZATION>, he has received a "Ritterkreuz" which he is showing in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even made some photographs! And so it goes, clichÃ© after clichÃ© is piling up and this is why the movie does not work.<br /><br />Basically von <PERSON>Trotta</PERSON> made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie. And in the end itÂ´s all very simple. <PERSON>Riemann</PERSON> finds a way to get <PERSON>Goebbels</PERSON> into bed and - ta da! - everyone is free. Which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the "true story" claim at the beginning. Like "Sass" it is vaguely BASED on a true event.<br /><br />It is sad but true, this IS the typical German movie these days. It is bad! <PERSON>Macaulay J. Connor</PERSON><br /><br />
889 1 This is the kind of movie <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of <PERSON>E. M. Forster</PERSON> novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON>, having appeared as the wife of <PERSON>Jeremy Irons</PERSON> who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in <PERSON>Rose Arbuthnot</PERSON>, one who with <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON> who plays <PERSON>Lottie Wilkins</PERSON>, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one <PERSON>Caroline Dester</PERSON>, played by the enigmatic <PERSON>Polly Walker</PERSON> who resembles a very vamp <PERSON>Louise Brooks</PERSON> (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> (<PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON>). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. <PERSON>Alfred Molina</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Broadbent</PERSON> (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, <PERSON>Mike Newell</PERSON> makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.
890 0 One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good way) was that <PERSON>Nathan Stoltzfus</PERSON>, who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded. <br /><br />Another reviewer said that von <PERSON>Trotta</PERSON> said she never meant for <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> to bed <PERSON>Goebbels</PERSON>, but in that case, why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release, such as the disaster that was <LOCATION>Stalingrad</LOCATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>' fear that the international press, based in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, would find out about the protest.<br /><br />Also, why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again? Surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history! In places, it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common.<br /><br />Overall, this film failed in its aim, which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance, which is a shame, because done better, it could have had a major impact.
891 1 I first saw Enchanted April about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for the month of April, leaving their humdrum lives behind them. They are very sad women at the outset of the film, and you can't help but root them on as they plan this get-away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses. This is perhaps the most feel good movie I have ever seen. It' pure and simple, with no car chases, no animosities and no deaths. It was made with care and in very good taste. You cannot help but smile all through it -- except when you're crying happy tears!
892 0 This was disappointing. It started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar, it fell flat. <PERSON>Maria Schrader</PERSON>'s acting is dreadful, never seeming to mean what she says, or even knowing what she says until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion at all, not for her beloved goy, or her mother's story. When with <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>'s story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which isn't much. The supposed parallel between <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON>'s "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clichÃ© as they come, and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what <PERSON>Lena</PERSON> had or had not done to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to care about any of them, even little <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>. Everything with <PERSON>Luis</PERSON> was a distraction. (Why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatever for that.) If every reference to him was removed it wouldn't be noticed. <br /><br />A simple story made confusing by poor character development (who was whose mother, again??) weak acting, and directing that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear "quiet on the set!...." I started thinking this was worthy of a 7, but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4, then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile a movie as I have seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
893 1 One of my all time favourite films, ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotion, wit, humour, intelligence. The story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways.<br /><br />The cast are also fantasic..... a great selection of the finest British talent around. I loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film.<br /><br /><LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this, - everything about this film works.<br /><br /> I love it :)
894 0 Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There often quite lame, morale dedicative, and just plain. So is this show! It got a boring cast, although A.Bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical crap....as always. We have all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled. Cause, lets face it, its a mediocre and self righteous show. As the most sitcoms are....<br /><br />Well, in short. If you wanna see some good entertainment, you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror. Do some faces and move on.... Its more entertaining than this show!
895 1 This is one of the best movies. It is one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work also.<br /><br />The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list. However, they give equal or better performances than the top of the list.<br /><br />It is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world.<br /><br />If you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings. Then go watch a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. See the movie. It is a must. TH
896 0 What I hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys. <PERSON>Amanda Bynes</PERSON>' talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant on "All That" and her own show. Why they would write her and <PERSON>Jenny Garth</PERSON> as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, "old-maid" wannabes is beyond me.<br /><br />Their plots and dialog remind me of "The Simpons", <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> says whenever his cartoon character <PERSON>Poochie</PERSON> is not on screen, "Everyone should ask, where's Poochie?". All the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy. Sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead. Then they get back together or break up at the end. The 2 women are either shallow, stupid, or sex addicts. The only word I can think of is "sucks".
897 1 I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not referring only to the breathtaking scenery. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives. In the end four women total rent the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons for being there. In this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions, more so than without. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding. The acting is a joy to watch in itself. I especially love the characters of <PERSON>Lottie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Lady Caroline</PERSON> (<PERSON>Polly Walker</PERSON>).
898 0 I'll admit I've only watched a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different from the next. It seems after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, drop characters, introduce new ones, and rewrite the entire show dynamic.<br /><br />As you have probably surmised already, the show is about quirky, unpredictable teenager <PERSON>Holly</PERSON> (<PERSON>Amanda Bynes</PERSON>) who moves in with her high strung sister <PERSON>Valerie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jennie Garth</PERSON>) in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. Decent enough premise: odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx.<br /><br />While I miss the sitcoms of yore, this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly, and it's sad because they have some decent talent.<br /><br />On top of everything, they insisted on changing the show (<PERSON>Val</PERSON> was living with a cast regular bf one season, then he was suddenly gone, so she opens a bakery? what?) When things change that drastically, you get the feeling that even the *show* knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, characters written off and new show regulars!<br /><br />On a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know this is a television show and not real at all, but <PERSON>Val</PERSON> and <PERSON>Holly</PERSON> end up living in a HUGE loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace... in <LOCATION>MANHATTAN</LOCATION>! Are you serious!?
899 1 For anyone who's judged others at first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character. The grumpy old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The flighty, unsure, 'ditsy' dame who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all. The cold, prim, proper, neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute - given the right setting. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, partying, pursued by throngs - wants peace, quiet, and love without possessiveness. <br /><br />By taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.
900 0 This show is painful to watch ...<br /><br />It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing "jobs", boyfriends, and cast. It appears that they wanted to cast <PERSON>Amanda Bynes</PERSON> in something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. They cast her as a teen, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. Soon, they realize that she needs a "clique" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.<br /><br />How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> has now decided that it is a "family" show, and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on <ORGANIZATION>ABC Family</ORGANIZATION>.
901 1 I'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately the movie was rather short, unusually so for a period piece, and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect. However, the excellent story makes up for it. The four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds. Over the course of the movie, they realize their problems and begin fixing them. They believe <LOCATION>San Salvatore</LOCATION>, the castle they stay in, has an enchanting effect on people. "It's a tub of love," says <PERSON>Lottie Wilkins</PERSON>. You can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the Italian seaside works its magic on them.<br /><br />All their problems and their solutions are plausible. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic Italian locale. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
902 0 I don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that, this movie stunk. I didn't know whether to turn off the set, or file a lawsuit with O.J.'s attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health. I have seldom been this bored; to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie-goer across the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was uninspired, the 'drama' was emotionless. I am thankful I didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience.
903 1 If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with <PERSON>Alfred Molina</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Polly Walker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Broadbent</PERSON>, <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Michael Kitchens</PERSON> in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of <PERSON>Mike Newell</PERSON>, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.
904 0 I watched this movie for a project on love. please tell <PERSON>Nicolas Cage</PERSON> to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying. My life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick flick. It is not a strict romantic. And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow. All in all, just not a good flick.
905 1 "My child, my sister, dream <br /><br />How sweet all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that kind land to live together, <br /><br />And there love slow and long, <br /><br />There love and die among <br /><br />Those scenes that image you, that sumptuous weather."<br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by <PERSON>Elizabeth Von Arnim</PERSON>, "Enachanted April" can be described in one sentence Â– it takes place in the early 1920s when four <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - an ultimate "feel good" movie is perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and later that year I did and I was not alone.<br /><br />Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality.
906 0 Ok, first the good: <PERSON>Cher</PERSON>'s performance and the cinematography. Although I'm no <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written. The cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance.<br /><br />The Rest: a thin plotline, <PERSON>Nicholas Cage</PERSON>'s performance, and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Firstly, everytime time <PERSON>Cage</PERSON> opened his mouth I cringed. I don't know what kind of accent he was trying use. I honestly don't, it sure wasnt any <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it wasn't because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears. And I like <PERSON>Nicholas Cage</PERSON> in other performances. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, and frankly I've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided. And that would be on a boring night at the house. What a let down.
907 1 I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie with no cussing, no sex, and no violence. One might think of it as "the ultimate chick flick", but I bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too. Don't invite the kids, though. This movie is very low-key.<br /><br />Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The sound track and gorgeous scenery, along with the ladies' gentle manners, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-Raphaelite painting.<br /><br />Lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie, I will paraphrase a line I heard once on "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies are "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
908 0 Generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course <PERSON>Dean Martin</PERSON> songs. Problem is <PERSON>Nicholas Cage</PERSON>, there is no chemistry between he and <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> and they are the central love story. <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.
909 1 Had a bad day? Dog bit the mailman? Car wouldn't start? People got on your nerves? Then refresh yourself with a delightful experience.<br /><br />Two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a month's rental of a villa in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. Due to financial circumstances, two other women join them. Two have humdrum marital lives; one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by life.<br /><br />As the spell of the villa permeates their spirits, each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook. This also changes the people in their lives who have visited them. As they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them...and you will find your outlook altered, for the better. A delightfully uplifting movie!
910 0 Even thought I'm not the biggest of <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. Granted, there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage, memory loss (and) intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. A 1989 survey of <PERSON>Moonstruck</PERSON> fans by the <ORGANIZATION>UK Advocacy Network</ORGANIZATION> revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed <PERSON>Moonstruck</PERSON> had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.<br /><br /><PERSON>Cher</PERSON> plays someone very un-Cher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> living in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with her extended family. They're anti-American, pro-Italian and always at each other in someway. She has been going out with <PERSON>Johnny Camarary</PERSON> for a while, a nice mamma's boy man, and he asks her to marry him. She says yes. I loved her mom's questions: "Do you love him <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON>?", "No.", "Good. If you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can. But you like him then?", "Oh yeah, he's a sweet man Ma". When <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON> goes off to <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> to care for his dying mother, he asks that <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years.<br /><br />This victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> was the birthplace of electroshock treatment. In 1938, Italian psychiatrist <PERSON>Ugo Cerletti</PERSON>, saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs, easing the job of slitting their throats. <PERSON>Cerletti</PERSON> was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first Electroshock machine. Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.<br /><br />This was,in so many ways, an anti-American movie. It's about love, to be sure, but it's also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by American policies. The characters, from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters. It's somewhat of a chick flick, as it's how <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp. It's a Cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan...<br /><br />Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses. But we might ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, though in no way sworn to any Hippocratic Oath, should be offering it.
911 1 "Magic" isn't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves. You find yourself relaxing, and seeing others in a more benevolent light... Any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention. Seldom are we soaked in beauty like this. As if that weren't enough, it's funny. Performances are, without exception, extraordinary, but special mention must be made of the miraculous <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON>, and the superb <PERSON>Josie Walker</PERSON> - both open like roses.<br /><br />Why ISN'T this film on DVD? It deserves to live forever.
912 0 Add to the list of caricatures: a Southern preacher and "congregation," a torch singer (<PERSON>Sophie Tucker</PERSON>?), a dancing chorus, and The <ORGANIZATION>Mills Brothers</ORGANIZATION> -- it only makes it worse.<br /><br />Contemptible burlesques of "Negro" performers, who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race. Though the "Negro comedy" may have been accepted in its day, it's extremely offensive today, and I doubt that it was ever funny. Though I wouldn't have been offended, I don't think that I'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, however, I might not have understood some of it.
913 1 This is a lovely, spirit-restoring movie. From the use of the actual villa that inspired <PERSON>Elizabeth Arngrim</PERSON> to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. <PERSON>Josie Lawrence</PERSON>, <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Polly Walker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joan Plowright</PERSON> seem to have been born to play these parts! I would dearly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
914 0 Sure, I like short cartoons, but I didn't like this one. Naturally, kids would love it. But then again, I'm not a kid anymore (although I still consider myself young).<br /><br />I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no story. How is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an Oscar?! Well... I guess it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now. In the present where we live, everything must happen fast. Look at the movies nowadays, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow. That's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30's, because it seems so peaceful. But every time has got its ups and downs, I guess...<br /><br />To conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you'll have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't spill your time on it.
915 1 This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy I can't get it out of my head. I find as I get older I am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done, and these four are excellent in their endeavors. Some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our PC world we'd never be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy, and a little forensic work you'll love this show. It reminds me of <PERSON>Quincy</PERSON>, ME in one way and <PERSON>Barney Miller</PERSON> in another the way they work and inter-react with each other. They screw up a lot but they get the job done, and that's what counts.
916 0 What is this crap? My little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie DVD art and title... I decided to watch it with her so she didn't get bored, and I sure was appalled at the horrible quality.<br /><br />First, the acting was terrible. They seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards. The delivery is sub-par and very formulaic. Scene cuts were terrible.. it looks like they took it straight from the story board, if there was one.<br /><br />Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes weren't original or well played at all- again, very formulaic. I can't count the times I was able to predict the next joke. I got a few chuckles out of the blatantly "subtle" sexual innuendos. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, <PERSON>Hung Wong</PERSON>?.. c'mon! Just.. stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It's like a PG kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity, and violence to bump the <ORGANIZATION>MPAA</ORGANIZATION> rating. STAY AWAY.<br /><br />"Would you like to ride my yacht?"<br /><br />"Is that what they're calling it now?"<br /><br />"You could ride my ding."<br /><br />"Oh! I think I got blood on my stool!"<br /><br />Badly played, sir.
917 1 My wife, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I am "old and grey" and still interested in life:-). If anyone has the full lyrics please send them.<br /><br />Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show.<br /><br />This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated, on a par with some of our other favourites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
918 0 I was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake.<br /><br />I can't write a single good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs. In my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic.<br /><br />Low budget 'effects' (if I can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money.<br /><br />Acting... I feel sorry for the actors. Are <PERSON>Pamela Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this? (looking at their recent filmography, it would appear so.) Despite the outfits, <PERSON>Pamela</PERSON> is showing her age and as a whole, they don't even come across as sexy, let alone funny.<br /><br />This movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category. It's just bad, as if everybody involved was sick of it.<br /><br />Avoid.
919 1 This is the best series of its type I've seen all year. I can't help thinking it's just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending episodes.<br /><br />I think the reasons New Tricks succeeds are many. The scripts are good, and the mix of characters superb, The acting is top flight, and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat. The stories aren't all that memorable, but that's not the reason I watch shows like this one. <br /><br />The theme song is a favourite, and we were disappointed to find it isn't available in any published edition. Great stuff, <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal (aside from the young constable nobody's there as eye-lolly, and even if he IS, he can still act!).
920 0 I was required to watch the movie for my work, so I didn't pay for it (on the contrary, i got paid), but I still found the movie to suck far more than average. The jokes were lame, the two lead actresses... well, to use the "First wives club" division of women's ages in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, they are no longer in their "hot chick" age but more in their "district attorney" age. What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to "do his wife", not realizing they're expected to assassinate her). All in all, a bland piece of crap.
921 1 This is a wonderful new crime series, bringing together three old stalwarts of British television (<PERSON>Denis Waterman</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Bolam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alun Armstrong</PERSON>) as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases, under the leadership of younger, career-focused <PERSON>Amanda Redman</PERSON>. The three quirky, irritable old cops make a brilliant team, applying twenty-year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then - sometimes with effect, at other times to the horror of their senior officers. The three are portrayed sympathetically, warts and all. There are splendid comic scenes, and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts.<br /><br />At the end of the first six-part series (we are promised a further series next year) each of the characters had developed. Widower <PERSON>James Bolam</PERSON> cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death. <PERSON>Lothario Denis Waterman</PERSON> is learning to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessive <PERSON>Alun Armstrong</PERSON> is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication! While <PERSON>Amanda Redman</PERSON> has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The story lines have been interesting, if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of DNA-testing. But it is the interplay of four of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s finest actors which has made the series unmissable.
922 0 Warning: Avoid this super duper awful movie...if you watched it you will be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed.<br /><br />Pam and <PERSON>Denise</PERSON> are grandma age now what are they doing? Trying SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, just not working AT ALL. <PERSON>Pam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denise</PERSON> act so horribly in this movie.<br /><br />Plus The script is absolutely atrocious, I can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas. With the development of movie industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century. I bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too.<br /><br />Stay away from it. I think watch "<ORGANIZATION>White Chicks</ORGANIZATION>" from 2004 it's so much better that this...make no mistake at that time I thought that's the worst movie I have ever seen.
923 1 Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities I think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb.<br /><br />It's your basic 'who done it?' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end. I like these kinds of movies and I certainly think this one meets the standard.<br /><br />To me it was worth watching more than once so I'll give it an 8 on imdb.
924 0 This has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Awful acting, awful script... and they were the good points! One to Definitely miss! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic. <PERSON>Pamela Anderson</PERSON> is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat willing to give it a chance, hoping that it was going to improve which, alas, it didn't! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle down for a good read! I like <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>, which is why I gave this movie a go, but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me!
925 1 "The Luzhin Defence" is, in the foreground, a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (<PERSON>Turturro</PERSON>) who becomes consumed by the game and, in the background via flashbacks, his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become. Factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest (<PERSON>Watson</PERSON>) and former "mentor" (<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Lake Como</LOCATION> and the intensity of high chess play. An excellent film for those into period dramas, the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film.
926 0 Blonde and Blonder was unfunny.Basically, it was a rip-off girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too much background noises and music.WAY TOO MUCH BACKGROUND NOISES AND MUSIC IF YOU ASK ME!!!!It starts out immensely boring, and TOTALLY inane.It doesn't pick up pace anywhere soon, and I was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on.Maybe, the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes.I found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end, but that was the only part.Also, I couldn't help but like <PERSON>Pamela Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denise Richard</PERSON>'s characters a little.Even though this movie didn't get any laughs from me, it kept my attention.I wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than Blonde and Blonder.
927 1 Of course the plot, script, and, especially casting are strong in the film. So many fine things to see. One aspect I liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--<PERSON>Luzhini</PERSON>'s (<PERSON>Turturro</PERSON>'s)--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent--an Italian dandy in three piece and cane--turns out to be a real gent, and a truly fine chess player. To his credit the "opponent" nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously (<ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> has taken a flyer out a window--sad, but so releasing to him)by way of the unstable genius' widow (<PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>.) In death, then, because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master, <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s defence (which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity) is allowed to be played. The Italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "end game!"
928 0 This movie is not in anyway funny, it tries to be funny with it's lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing, "when is this gonna end". One thing you have to hand to them, is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments, which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars. It is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book, even the ones that wasn't funny the first time. It basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this movie is blonde humor gone bad, it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch, it is just that bad.
929 1 I fell in love with <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> in Breaking the Waves, then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in <PERSON>Hilary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>. Now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering. Her eyes are the mirror to his soul --and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are.<br /><br />Those who take things literally will find <PERSON>Marleen Gorris</PERSON>' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating. Romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.
930 0 When I was at the movie store the other day, I passed up Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people bashed <PERSON>Romy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer <PERSON>Pamela Anderson</PERSON>, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: <PERSON>Pam Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON>, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's, not their 40's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious.<br /><br /><PERSON>Dee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dawn</PERSON> are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's, they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their "ignorance is bliss" attitudes. They are set up to make a "hit" on a guy, and they think they're just going to "show him a good time", but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls.<br /><br /><PERSON>Denise</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pam</PERSON> just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell.<br /><br />1/10
931 1 <PERSON>Marlene Gorris</PERSON> has established herself as one of the world's great directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by <PERSON>Vladimir Nabokov</PERSON> and captures well that writer's dark irony. <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> gives what I consider to be his finest performance (I am usually not a fan of his); and <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> is brilliant as well. Well worth seeing.
932 0 How could I best express my feelings about this movie: hideous? a headache? lack of coherent writing? plain stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty. And that just for the direction.<br /><br />Story? Well I guess there is a story. Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course. They are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' (sarcasm) and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters'. One thinks "taking him out" means a date, and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of. And of course, the turtle reserve for the farting turtle, that they build with the casino winnings.<br /><br />Sounds likes all this could be funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but its not. Filming sequences aren't well done. I've seen better filming in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> movies. Visuals are average for a late 80s film. But the problem is that its a 2007 movie.<br /><br />Not worth my time to ever watch this again. It still doesn't beat <PERSON>Danny Glover</PERSON>'s "Out" movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time, but then again that film is in a class of its own. "F"
933 1 This was an exteremely good historical drama. <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> is excellent as the tortured genius <PERSON>Luzhin</PERSON> and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affectations such as his strange dancing. <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON>.<br /><br />The relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by <PERSON>Gorris</PERSON> and familiar <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON> preoccupations such as 'eternal innocence' (i.e. 'Lolita') are evident in this film. I think I will now go on to read the novel. It was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
934 0 There are bad movies, terrible movies even boring movies...I can watch most and put up until the end, not this time. Avoid this like the plague, annoying music throughout, terrible editing, no comedy, its tackier than a novelty mug...My missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be Legally Blonde material or something kind of watchable, but never better than average, chick flick. Its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button.<br /><br />The Girls, well, they were not great to start with (<PERSON>Denise</PERSON> done OK in Starship Troopers and Wild things) but you have sank to the gravel. I feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this...<PERSON>Pamela Anderson</PERSON> is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face.<br /><br />Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen.
935 1 This film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by <PERSON>Vladimir Nabokov</PERSON> and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /><br />The photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Watson</PERSON>. <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought. <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> also performs brilliantly.<br /><br />The story is about a phenomenal chess player (<PERSON>Turturro</PERSON>) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non linear time, with multiple flashbacks of <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s childhood. Through those, the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /><br />I have nothing more to say, but to suggest this film to anyone.
936 0 Before I comment on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked this out was to rewatch something I first saw on the TV ads in 1980: <PERSON>Barbara Bach</PERSON>'s cleavage. And since the movie received an R rating, I expected to see her nude. Alas, no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here: <PERSON>Stacey Nelkin</PERSON> who's supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this. Seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as Ms. <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>. They provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides. In fact, I don't blame <PERSON>Ron Leibman</PERSON> for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight-fisted <PERSON>Liceman</PERSON> is pretty embarrassing though I did like the "seduction" scene he did with Ms. <PERSON>Nelkin</PERSON>. This also happens to be the debut of <PERSON>Ralph Macchio</PERSON> who's the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school. The others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and Ms. <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>, an Arab who worships motor oil, and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend Candy (<PERSON>Nelkin</PERSON>'s character) so much, he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy. Among the supporting cast, <PERSON>Tom Poston</PERSON> plays a swishy character named <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> who I found partly amusing. With a screenplay by <PERSON>Tom Patchett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jay Tarses</PERSON> and direction by <PERSON>Robert Downey Sr.</PERSON> (whose son <PERSON>Robert Downey Jr.</PERSON> has a cameo early on in a soccer scene), Up the <ORGANIZATION>Academy</ORGANIZATION> is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you're really offended at the scatological and sexual content, this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and its trademark cover boy-Alfred E. Newman-shouldn't be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture...P.S. Another one of the "misfits" was <PERSON>Harry Teinowitz</PERSON> who was born in my birth town of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. He played <PERSON>Rodney Ververgaert</PERSON>. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
937 1 The literary genius of <PERSON>Vladimir Navokov</PERSON> is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. The director puts us in check mate with the story of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. <LOCATION>Nastasya</LOCATION> is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. She meets <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. A magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. He arrives and questioning <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> we get these fades to the past, ala' Godfather II, where we see young <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>, a child prodigy. He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. Thinking <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend. The old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>. In a serious chess game where <ORGANIZATION>World Chess Champion</ORGANIZATION> victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is <PERSON>Nastasya</PERSON>'s wedding, the old teacher interferes and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> is sent on a nervous breakdown. <PERSON>Nastasya</PERSON>, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> plays his role sublimely.The director underestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defense</ORGANIZATION> is after trading queens, isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King, sacrificing the castle for mate. Nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. The <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defense</ORGANIZATION> elegantly gives Navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.
938 0 <ORGANIZATION>Mad Magazine</ORGANIZATION> may have a lot of crazy people working for it...but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers-that-be disowned this waste of celluloid...the editing is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid...and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that <PERSON>Stacy Nelkin</PERSON> takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot...I never thought I would feel sorry for <PERSON>Ralph Macchio</PERSON> making the decision to be in this thing, but I do...and I REALLY feel bad for <PERSON>Ron Leibman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tom Poston</PERSON>, gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of...film...at least Mr. <PERSON>Leibman</PERSON> had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie...and he comes out ahead...there are actually copies of this thing with Mad's beginning sequence still on it...if you can locate one, grab it cuz it is probably worth something...it's the only thing about this movie that's worth anything...and a note to the folks at IMDb.com...there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone...the makers spoiled it by themselves...
939 1 The story-line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. <PERSON>John Turtorro</PERSON> doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak of the Italian player. Motives weren't very much outlined either.<br /><br />
940 0 I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like <PERSON>Caddyshack</PERSON> and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. No T&A. No great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. The only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them. Yep, I watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(
941 1 As a psychiatrist specialized in trauma, I find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma, even a trauma. It not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither, but that even love is sometimes not enough. But she tries!
942 0 A stale "misfits-in-the-army" saga, which half-heartedly attempts to be both surreal (the foreign subtitles) AND vulgar (the flatulence gags), but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor, none of them followed very successfully. <PERSON>Barbara Bach</PERSON>, the Bond Girl from "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three brief scenes. What a waste! (*1/2)
943 1 This movie stars <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>, of Breaking the Waves fame. This movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held. A chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>. She falls for this oddball of a man, who is obsessed with chess. This is all at the dismay of her mother, who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a proper gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman, as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such. What ensues is mostly a journey through the man's psyche. It tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present. <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character. It is definitely slow, but is well worth the watching. The ending was even satisfying. :)
944 0 The only thing I remember about this movie are two things: first, as a twelve year old, even I thought it stunk. Second, it was so bad that when Mad magazine did a parody of it, they quit after the first page, and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it.<br /><br />If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period, try <ORGANIZATION>Animal House</ORGANIZATION>. It's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art. Another good selection would be Caddyshack, the classic with the late <PERSON>Rodney Dangerfield</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Murray</PERSON> before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines like greens keeper <PERSON>Carl Spackler</PERSON>'s "Correct me if I'm wrong <PERSON>Sandy</PERSON>, but if I kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key."
945 1 This movie was well done in all respects. The acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which I purchased because it was so moving. It is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods "white hunter,black heart". This movie is simply the best.<br /><br />cheers Zuf
946 0 That's what my friend <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> said about this movie after about an hour of it. He wasn't able to keep from dozing off. I had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally I relented and played it, having run out of adjectives for "boring". <br /><br />Imagine if you will, the pinnacle of hack-work. Something so uninspired, so impossibly dreadful, that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody. Some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable. It is not, not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would ONLY recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is. Don't believe me? Gather 'round. <br /><br />Granted, as a nation, we in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> don't always portray Middle Eastern peoples in a tasteful manner. But how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam-fashion to a stack of <ORGANIZATION>Castrol</ORGANIZATION> motor oil bottles? You'll find that here. GET IT? THE ARAB WORSHIPS OIL. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would've been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke? It's not even close to "cleverly offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face. <br /><br />In the middle of the film, a five-man singing group called the "Landmines" takes the stage at an officers' ball. Okay- are you ready? The joke is THEY SING TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY. Why did I write that in caps also? Because the joke is POUND, POUND, POUNDED INTO YOUR HEAD with a marathon of HORRENDOUS sight gags. They start off mediocre enough; glasses cracking, punch tumblers shattering... then there is, I am 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence of A WOMAN'S SHOES COMING OFF. You read that correctly- the music was so bad, in one frame, the woman's feet have shoes on. In the very next- the shoes are off!!! Get it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came off! What the F???? <br /><br />Then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the SINGING IS BAD. If any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be astonished. This movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors. <PERSON>Robert Downey Sr.</PERSON> directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug-free. Badly. Other things to watch out for:<br /><br />1. The popular music shoehorned in wherever possible. Every time <PERSON>Liceman</PERSON> appears, a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song plays. Plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason.<br /><br />2. <PERSON>Barbara Bach</PERSON>'s criminally awful accent. She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage, like they're in a community school acting class and they've been directed to act like aroused retarded people. <br /><br />3. <PERSON>Liceman</PERSON> feeds his revolting dog a condom. Remember; when this movie came out throwing in "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "edgy". <br /><br />4. <PERSON>Tom Poston</PERSON> plays a mincing, boy-hungry pedophile, back when <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one in the same. Flat-out embarrassing. <br /><br />5. Watch the ending. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. That is actually the ending. Tell me that doesn't make you want to explode everyone who's ever made any movie, ever. <br /><br />Watch this at your own risk. Up The Academy has been known to actually make other movies, like The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less funny simply by placing the videotape near them.
947 1 Don't know how this missed award nominations. Great film. Certainly of the calibre of "Beautiful Mind" Great acting, photography, script and drama. I can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film.
948 0 I realize that living in the Western Plains of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly "made-for-TV" movie? Also, women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era Â… would it make for good viewing? Honestly, I don't know. I have thought about this film for the past two days, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet I can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest I have ever seen. From several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland. Was it good? Was it bad? That may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments I enjoyed and desperately hated! <br /><br />This film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes. Scenes where I wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole. I thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale. I do not know much about living in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind. The thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this Polaroid-esquire view untouched by corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. It was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience (though the television). There were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattle-branding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story. Director <PERSON>Richard Pearce</PERSON> did a great job of bringing the view of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> to the viewers, but I am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.<br /><br />While I will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, I had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side. Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as <PERSON>Clyde Stewart</PERSON>, a loner that somehow finds a connection with <PERSON>Conchata Ferrell</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Elinore Randall</PERSON>. The two as actors have no chemistry at all. Their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion. The pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two "veteran" actors portrayed it. The brave <PERSON>Elinore</PERSON> does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while <PERSON>Clyde</PERSON> gives an approving nod when she is done. This is love? Was it supposed to be love? I don't know, I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with Torn and <ORGANIZATION>Ferrell</ORGANIZATION>, it felt like two actors just playing their parts. Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse "knocks" on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that <PERSON>Clyde</PERSON> had for <PERSON>Elinore</PERSON>'s daughter (I just didn't believe it), the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene. The land scene especially because I needed more explanation on what <PERSON>Elinore</PERSON> was doing, why she was doing it, and why <PERSON>Clyde</PERSON> would build her a house if they were married! It was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.<br /><br />Overall, I will go middle of the road with this feature. There were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of <PERSON>Elinore</PERSON>, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation. These panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers. While there were some brilliant scenes of realism (starring cattle and pigs), I just felt as if we needed more. Depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story. <PERSON>Pearce</PERSON> could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clichÃ©d Western characters. <PERSON>Ferrell</PERSON> carried her own, but Torn was completely miscast. Decent for a viewing, but will not be picked up again by me.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****
949 1 Not having read <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON>, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view "The Luzhin Defence" as a movie. <br /><br />It works really well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances." The chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in, say "Searching for <PERSON>Bobby Fischer</PERSON>," in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.<br /><br />Through the feminist director <PERSON>Maureen Gorris</PERSON> (of "Antonia"), <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON>'s fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />The settings in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> are beautiful.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)
950 0 One of the most disgusting films I have ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> during the late 1800's. What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered, human birth, branding. Oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't too bad, but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was OK. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy. They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> during the late 1800's. But if you have a choice, do not see this movie.
951 1 Once again proving his amazing versatility, <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> plays the introspective Russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament, and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident (<PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>) at a 1920's Italian hotel. They fall in love,to the horror of her social-mountaineering mother (<PERSON>Geraldine James</PERSON>).A wonderful love story, whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral.But in spite of its origins in a <PERSON>Nabakov</PERSON> story, it certainly is not .The romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands <PERSON>down.John Turturro</PERSON>, having appeared in "<PERSON>Barton</PERSON> Fink" ,"O Brother,Where Art thou?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he is not dependant on <PERSON>Coen Bros</PERSON> films to assert his stature.
952 0 When converting a book to film, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of <PERSON>Elinore Stewart</PERSON>'s children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good, enriching, strengthening experiences of homesteading her land. The book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> frontier; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard stance for the time it was made, portraying this woman's experience as harsh, unforgiving, and nearly pointless. Perhaps the director was bringing some of his Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie (as some film aficionados have said), but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak, odious landscape devoid of friends or hope. Don't waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
953 1 A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So, there is more. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.<br /><br />This film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely. It's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting.<br /><br />I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. All in all, most of the film goes down very easily. It is also forgotten again very easily though. So it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.<br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
954 0 I read somewhere that when <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> refused to take a cut in pay, <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract.<br /><br />She decided to take the money. But her career suffered accordingly.<br /><br />That might explain what she was doing in "Comet Over Broadway." (Though it doesn't explain why <PERSON>Donald Crisp</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ian Hunter</PERSON> are in it, too.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film, and that's right on target. The murder trial. Her seedy vaudeville career. Her success in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Her final scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part.<br /><br />Also, the sets and costumes looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION> is showing lots and lots of her movies this month. Watch any OTHER one and you'll be doing yourself a favor.
955 1 Hi all I am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6. I supposed I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film.<br /><br />In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called <PERSON>Curt von Bardeleben</PERSON> who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against <PERSON>Steinitz</PERSON>, where a beautiful combination was played by <PERSON>Steinitz</PERSON>. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return.<br /><br />The social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess I suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. A major example of this is the chess legend <PERSON>Bobby Fischer</PERSON>. Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways.<br /><br />In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>. The format is a knockout, which actually the world Governing body of Fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other.<br /><br />The position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself. In fact, I have done a youtube video about it, for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes <PERSON>Tryfon</PERSON>
956 0 The competition for the worst <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> movie is stiff. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> is the worst so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. <PERSON>James Wong Howe</PERSON>'s cinematography is not. <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. <PERSON>Minna Gombell</PERSON> whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> and her child (when did the child learn that <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros</ORGANIZATION> tossing garbage to dolts who don't know, in <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros</ORGANIZATION>' cynical estimation of them, that what they're getting is garbage.
957 1 I'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in <LOCATION>Luzhin</LOCATION>'s game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of <PERSON>Jonathan Speelman</PERSON> as consultant chess expert, <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> is shown winning the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.
958 0 Wow, the plot for this film is all over the place! There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! And, as a result, none of it seemed particularly believable.<br /><br />The movie starts with <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> as a housewife living in a small town. She's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>. When a big-time actor arrives in town, she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost. But, her husband is worried about shenanigans--as this actor is a cad. So, the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor--and the actor dies! As a result, he's convicted of First Degree Murder!!! Not Manslaughter, but Murder 1! Now, pregnant and in need of funds, <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> goes to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. But Broadway jobs aren't to be found, so she's forced to take any job--even Burlesque. Unable to adequately care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise. However, eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy. But, the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play. Despondent, she makes her way to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and becomes a real star. Years later, she returns to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to get her kid--but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother. At the same time, her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $10,000 he can get the man out of prison. As another reviewer wrote, is this to bribe people?! How can $10,000 get him out otherwise--maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! Wow--this is enough for 2 or 3 films! And, all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! Believe it or not, there's quite a bit more to it. If you really care, see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.<br /><br />This is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping, somehow, it will all work. Unfortunately, the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms. <PERSON>Francis</PERSON>' best efforts. It's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd-rate plot. It's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements, threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! Overall, unless you are a die-hard <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> fan or love anything <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> made in the 1930s, this one is one you can easily skip. Not terrible but certainly not good.<br /><br />By the way, the child who plays <PERSON>Francis</PERSON>' daughter upon her return to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (<PERSON>Sybil Jason</PERSON>) really was terrible. I think she was supposed to be...I think.
959 1 <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, is she transmuted to the king? The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. Just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. The period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s lake district is captured magnificently. Not a single square of space is wasted.<br /><br />So many brilliant scenes abound, I cannot recount them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart, because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting. <br /><br />I did not read <PERSON>Nabakov</PERSON>'s book, but to try an analogy of my own, what I am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie, <PERSON>Barry Levinson</PERSON>'s The Natural. It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of <PERSON>Bernard Malamud</PERSON>'s fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing Russian and Italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment. The true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw. But, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit. <br /><br />Pure love, as personified by <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON>, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously. Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it.<br /><br />This is a magnificent movie (10/10).
960 0 2 stars for <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> -- she's wonderful! And she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> threw her way! <br /><br />The two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to town and invites <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> to his hotel to talk about possibilities, <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> tells her husband she's going to the movies. The hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that <PERSON>Kay</PERSON>'s not being truthful, and he sets out looking for her. He finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy, who falls over a railing, lands face-first in a pond (lake?), and dies. Now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based: <br /><br />1) the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water, that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever.) <br /><br />2) the hubby's lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> that it's all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room, then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she's the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place.<br /><br />I can't even go on with this review. The movie was just all too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you'd never have caught <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> playing such a wimp! In true <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> fashion, though, she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was a far cry from pre-code <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> roles and real-life spitfire <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON>.<br /><br />Steer way clear of this one! There are much better <PERSON>Kay Francis</PERSON> vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend <PERSON>Mary Stevens</PERSON>, MD and Jewel Robbery; also good are Dr. <PERSON>Monica</PERSON> and One Way Passage. I'm sure there's other great <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> flicks as well, but I'm only mentioning the ones I've seen and can recommend.)
961 1 The primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that <PERSON>Luhzin</PERSON> lives his life as a chess game. So many people have seen this film and just don't get it, and I don't understand why. While watching this film I was taken on a private journey which floored me. I will try to explain this without any spoilers, but be forewarned, I do talk about things that happen in the movie.<br /><br />**** Possible Spoilers **** Be Forewarned!****<br /><br />His is a life of "large moves" versus "small moves". He chooses <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> to be his <PERSON>Queen</PERSON>, and he and she behave as his Aunt first described the King and Queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen closely to that description.<br /><br />When someone asks him a question, he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves. (The flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) The flashbacks are quite interesting as well, for they give not only his point of view as a child, but the point of view of the other character as well. It's stunning.<br /><br />Various characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on. Even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on. Beautifully done.<br /><br />I will not comment more on what happens to the character of <PERSON>Luhzin</PERSON>, but I hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end.<br /><br />This film is constantly working on many levels, which is why I endorse it. It was a treat and a joy to watch.<br /><br />If you like this film I would recommend a film called Fresh. The only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces.<br /><br />
962 0 Any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story, it's annoying. Those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on. For this reason we often talk of the story "jumping through hoops" as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion.<br /><br />The story in "Comet Over Broadway" doesn't just jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus. It's so ludicrous, so ill-conceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through.<br /><br />The central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion. So, in the end there's no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor screenplays, the acting doesn't save a thing.
963 1 This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great. Maybe this is because <PERSON>Gorris</PERSON>' takes <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON>'s initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a point of view over <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> which dignifies him more than the <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON>'s one.<br /><br />The only thing in the movie which I don't like is the influence of <PERSON>Valentinov</PERSON>'s on <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s destiny. I can't imagine <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON> creating a person like <PERSON>Valentinov</PERSON> and giving him so great influence on novel's argument.
964 0 It figures this is a French film, LOL, with the emphasis on young girls with much older men...why is it the French are so fixated on this kind of thing? When the age difference is this great, it really comes off as pervy! <PERSON>Valentina Cervi</PERSON> is beautiful (she bears a strong resemblance to <PERSON>Olivia Hussey</PERSON>, of <PERSON>Zeffirelli</PERSON>'s '68 Romeo and <PERSON>Juliet</PERSON>, set in a similar period), but she looks about 15 and the actor playing <PERSON>Tassi</PERSON>, her painting instructor, looks...well, 50 is KIND.<br /><br />Other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record (unusually detailed in this case) of the real Artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period (17th century). Her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men" -- she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits -- and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant. Not only was she clearly assaulted, and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame), but <PERSON>Tassi</PERSON> was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child.<br /><br />The movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story -- very dramatic and not in need of any "spicing up" -- because in some weird Frencified way, it's "hotter" to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. That's "sexy" -- the truth is boring and seems too feminist/politically correct.<br /><br />It also disturbs me that this is ONLY part of Artemisia life considered interesting enough to film. The fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting of <PERSON>Judith</PERSON> beheading <PERSON>Holfernes</PERSON> was painted AFTER, not before the rape), that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Florentine Academy</ORGANIZATION>, that she went on to have children...oh that's boring stuff. After all, that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't "hot" like teenagers.<br /><br />I understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film (or a book) about a real historical character. You need to create dialog, have subplots, create dramatic structure. Certainly some details can be sacrificed -- it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years, or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette...and a big boned one, not a skinny minny), or something like that. But to turn her story around on her, and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing. It's even worse because the director is female. She should be horribly ashamed of herself!<br /><br />If you LIKE this (and I know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex), you will probably like "Dangerous Beauty" with <PERSON>Rufus Sewell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Catherine McCormack</PERSON>. Similarly based on heavily re-written history, with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets: Bon Appetit!
965 1 This is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. It captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s lake district in the twenties.) It's a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and believable. The settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images. And rather than the mandatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet one. If film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece.<br /><br />
966 0 I didn't think the French could make a bad movie, but I was, clearly, very wrong. As has been said before, this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /><br />The script is awful -- pretentious, stilted, and vapid -- and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting, rather than retelling, history. Along with some fairly decent set design, <PERSON>Valentina Cervi</PERSON>'s physical charms are the primary asset of this movie, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no time in contriving various "erotic" sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot, and does not, sustain this movie. The acting is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two. The cinematography is OK, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted-lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama. In any event, the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on Artemisia's body, and all too seldom on her paintings.<br /><br />All told, a near-complete failure. It's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography. So the French can fail, after all!
967 1 very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years ,but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it,<PERSON>John Toturro</PERSON> plays a psychologically challenged man ,nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces ,the game validates him as a person ,when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and <PERSON>John Torturro</PERSON> expresses this in a beautiful fashion,even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence.It makes you wonder if there other <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>'s out there who obsess about the game,i am sure they are,if you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch it.Its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well,it achieves its objectives,unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel.
968 0 I was disgusted by this movie. No it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It shows one piece of art work that she did (<PERSON>Judith Beheading Holofernese</PERSON>) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first <PERSON>Judith</PERSON> for a year after the trial.<br /><br />I don't know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, <PERSON>Tassi</PERSON> was not a noble character. He RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured. According to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew Artemisia (aka had sex with) while she states over and over again "It's true".<br /><br />I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about. Don't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work.<br /><br />Don't see the movie, but find out the true story of Artemisia.
969 1 <PERSON>Alexandr</PERSON> "Sascha" Luzhin (<PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON>) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an Italy-hosted tournament. His brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother, <PERSON>Vera</PERSON> (<PERSON>Geraldine James</PERSON>) to scope out possible marriage partners. Vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> is more fascinated by <PERSON>Sascha</PERSON>, whom she met on a walk. <PERSON>Sascha</PERSON>, too, is taken with <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> and proposes marriage at their second meeting. But, with the concentration that <PERSON>Sascha</PERSON> must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON>? Oh, and can he become the chess champion, also? This is a lovely film, based on a novel by <PERSON>Nabokov</PERSON>. The acting is amazing, with <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> utter perfection as the shy, awkward chess enthusiast. <PERSON>James</PERSON> gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. As for the look of the film, it could not be better. The scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety, the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause. Yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, at times, making it a film not everyone will appreciate. Then, too, the ending is bittersweet. However, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don't miss this one. You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms.
970 0 When I saw the preview, I thought: this is going to be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress playing the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. However the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610, and it took away most of the magic of the film. However, I must congratulate the translator, because the English sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original French cues, and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd!
971 1 'The <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defence</ORGANIZATION>' is a good film with fine central performances, but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's craft shines through. It felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along. <PERSON>Marlene Gorris</PERSON> could perhaps have examined the psyche of <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>, rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others.<br /><br />Adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between <LOCATION>Luzhin</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON>. <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON>'s rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film. I felt that I was put through <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s torment and eventual tragic end, without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled. However, this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one.
972 0 This flick was a blow to me. I guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models, home makers or mistresses, since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway. It is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated. Inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected), <PERSON>Artemisia</PERSON>'s entire character and all that she stands for, had been reduced to a standard <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, female character; a pitiful, physically flawless, helpless little creature, displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here. Sadder yet, was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film, and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture, just plain pisses me off. If the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.
973 1 'The <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defence</ORGANIZATION>' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.
974 0 What did the director think? Everybody who has read the biography of <LOCATION>Artemisia</LOCATION> is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that <PERSON>Tassi</PERSON> was guilty. That fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her MAN. Why do movies depicting Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> happy-happy-mood won? While I would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie I cannot make sense of turning Artimisia's life story on its head. Very disappointing choice by the makers of this film.
975 1 A movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defence</ORGANIZATION> charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.<br /><br />	It gives <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't give it to <PERSON>Ralph Fiennes</PERSON>, who would have murdered it.) Similarly, <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). To reach the tortured chess master (<PERSON>Turturro</PERSON>) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.<br /><br />	In a chance meeting between <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Watson</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Luzhin</PERSON>, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (<ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with "bold, brilliant moves" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).<br /><br />	This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (Or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).<br /><br />	The Italian sets are stunning. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer, yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and most deservedly so. Chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed. Although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.
976 0 An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Globe</ORGANIZATION>. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.
977 1 Part of the enjoyment that I took from this film stemmed from the fact that I knew nothing more about it than that it starred <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> (2 reasons enough to watch), was a period piece and involved chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. I shan't, therefore, give away much more. Suffice to say that <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him. It's about love and obsession, rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour, became totally compelling. And I defy anyone to second-guess the ending.
978 0 The acting is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are handsome, so if you're looking for well-acted soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the eponymous lead, is often a mystery. She could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit. Was she protecting her father, who went off half-cocked, as it were, when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit? Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter? During the trial, this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, who starts off as a narcissistic jerk, becomes a selfless hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Naturally, since no good deed must go unpunished, we are told that she never sees him again.
979 1 Walking home after the film, I was humming the familiar waltz music that <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> were dancing to. I've heard that before - where? Ah, from <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON>'s "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), 'got it just as I arrived at the door. It's "Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2" composed by <PERSON>Dimitri Shostakovich</PERSON>, performed here by The <ORGANIZATION>City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower's. What a treat! The film score by <PERSON>Alexandre Desplat</PERSON> was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz. It's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score. Reminds me of favorite scores by <PERSON>Maurice Jarre</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ennio Morricone</PERSON> (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), <PERSON>Georges Delerue</PERSON>, and <PERSON>John Barry</PERSON>. There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp. <br /><br /><PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> delivered a credibly consuming paired performance. The love story, their intimate connection, is very much between <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> and <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> - his childlike yet tormenting inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both. Director <PERSON>Marleen Gorris</PERSON> of "Antonia's Line" (1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect. The front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess. Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's. Cinematography captures the serene beauty of <LOCATION>Lake Como</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> near the Swiss border.<br /><br />I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies. <PERSON>Alexandre Desplat</PERSON>'s lyrical film score of "The Luzhin Defence" is complete.
980 0 Artemesia takes the usual story about the art world, eg, "You can't paint that! But I want to!" and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film, well, interesting, but not remarkable.<br /><br />The story is about one of the first female painters around, Artemesia who course, is fiercely independent, but just can't stop thinking of men, and their bodiesÂ… for artistic purposes of course. She soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist, but soon tutoring becomes much more then art, and soon after that, scandal erupts! Funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft-porn fantasy. I mean, was Artemesia THAT much of a man-hungry person? Also, it's quite funny when she's insisting that she "paints for herself!" yet falls for the first person she sees.<br /><br />Actually, the story itself is quite fascinating, and it ends with a trial, which I always love. But I wasn't too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher, who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn't fall for. I woulda gone for the young fisherman :P
981 1 Obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival. Lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in `The <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defence</ORGANIZATION>,' directed by <PERSON>Marleen Gorris</PERSON>, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter.<br /><br />	At an Italian resort in the 1920's, <PERSON>Alexander Luzhin</PERSON> (<PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON>) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion. <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> is a Master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. So <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> is a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. That man is <PERSON>Valentinov</PERSON> (<PERSON>Stuart Wilson</PERSON>), <PERSON>Luzhin</PERSON>'s former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to <LOCATION>Luzhin</LOCATION>.<br /><br />	<PERSON>Valentinov</PERSON> is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, <PERSON>Turati</PERSON> (<PERSON>Fabio Sartor</PERSON>), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON>). And, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life.<br /><br />	To tell <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s story, <PERSON>Gorris</PERSON> effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who <PERSON>Luzhin</PERSON> is and how he got to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, <PERSON>Gorris</PERSON> textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace <PERSON>Gorris</PERSON> sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of <PERSON>Valentinov</PERSON>, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s tragedy all the more believable and unsettling.<br /><br />	The single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON>. For this film to work, <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. It doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the <PERSON>Luzhin Turturro</PERSON> creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. He captures <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. It's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, <PERSON>Geoffrey Rush</PERSON>'s portrayal of <PERSON>David Helfgott</PERSON> in `Shine.' And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from <PERSON>Sid Lidz</PERSON> in `Unstrung Heroes' to <PERSON>Pete</PERSON> in `O Brother Where Art Thou?' to <PERSON>Al Fountain</PERSON> in `Box of Moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is.<br /><br />	As <PERSON>Natalia</PERSON>, <PERSON>Emily Watson</PERSON> is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. Most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION> believable and lends total credibility to the story. You have but to look into <PERSON>Watson</PERSON>'s eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor.<br /><br />	The supporting cast includes <PERSON>Geraldine James</PERSON> (Vera), <PERSON>Christopher Thompson</PERSON> (Stassard), <PERSON>Peter Blythe</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ilya</PERSON>), <PERSON>Orla Brady</PERSON> (<PERSON>Anna</PERSON>), <PERSON>Mark Tandy</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s Father), <PERSON>Kelly Hunter</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Luzhin</ORGANIZATION>'s Mother), <PERSON>Alexander Hunting</PERSON> (<PERSON>Young Luzhin</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Luigi Petrucci</PERSON> (<PERSON>Santucci</PERSON>). Well crafted and delivered, `The <ORGANIZATION>Luzhin Defence</ORGANIZATION>' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. We don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us. I rate this one 9/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />
982 0 As others have noted, this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life and I for one was very annoyed and offended... by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair, by the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent,' by its complete disregard for her work, by the way it turned her into a sex object, on and on, you get the idea. Also, I find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with Gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her.
983 1 Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet outrageous & funny. Leave it to <PERSON>Fox</PERSON> to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.<br /><br />People either loved the show or hated it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
984 0 If you're after the real story of early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you've found you're movie.<br /><br />This film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep. (Type in Artemisia inaccuracies in <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> and check out some of the fact vs. fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES let it down a bit.<br /><br />I wonder how the director/co-writer AgnÃ¨s <PERSON>Merlet</PERSON> defended her film at the time? Perhaps she refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would've been unfortunate, because lets face it, she was.
985 1 Let me first state that while I have viewed every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie. Those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors. The acting was better than average, but the plot held no surprises. They tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation. Now as to the historical errors, if you call them that, the first Capitan to pilot the Enterprise was Commander April, then Capt. <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Kirk</PERSON>, etc.. According to a statement made by both <PERSON>Riker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> we dicovered the Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's the reason a prime directive was created) but like I said these are no reason to discredit this fine series. I hope the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a backseat.
986 0 Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result. Violent sexy <PERSON>Milligan</PERSON> at his most home made. Little better than a home movie (as much of Milligans films are) this is a trip into depravity 1960's style. Notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint.(though decidedly r rated). The film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production.(No one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke). Its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a <ORGANIZATION>Milligan</ORGANIZATION> completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around.
987 1 I have been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series I was very excited.<br /><br />The premiere of Enterprise was well worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.<br /><br /><PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON> was just superior as Captain <PERSON>Jonathan Archer</PERSON>. <PERSON>Jolene Blalock</PERSON> gave a commanding performance as <PERSON>Subcommander T'Pol</PERSON>. That it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of <ORGANIZATION>Starfleet</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br />Enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching, and I recommend that. Watch it.
988 0 Sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" are worse than almost any <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> movie). After two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for some peace and quiet. (*1/2)
989 1 This is the start of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a "down to earth"-kind of feel with darker and less "plaggy" scenography.<br /><br />The characters need some more time to develop but they have potential. One thing that is fairly disappointing (with all Star Trek series really) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (Earth has stopped war, famine etc)<br /><br /> The female characters here are two, subcommander T'Pol who is vulcan and communications officer <PERSON>Hoshi</PERSON> who is human. <PERSON>Hoshi</PERSON> is quite wimpy and T'Pol is made to be a "vulcan babe".<br /><br /> Some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too American (as opposed to the more international feel of the TNG-crew) but creates interesting dynamics.<br /><br /> A very good pilot though for a very good series.
990 0 This was an incredibly stupid movie. It was possibly the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6.............
991 1 <br /><br />There is STAR TREK canon -- lots of it. From canon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc.<br /><br />ENTERPRISE pretty much disregards much of ST canon. An unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro back from there -- but no.<br /><br />The phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS. An old style <ORGANIZATION>Starfleet</ORGANIZATION> laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what I expected to see. Also, I did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to TNG but far apart from TOS sound effects. <br /><br />In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in ENTERPRISE.<br /><br />It is fine that Captain <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> is unsure about the needs of the Universe (quite unlike <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but inside ENTERPRISE everyone seems like an equal. Unprofessional, unsure, more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any ST series -- and that says a lot!<br /><br />The casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel.<br /><br />ENTERPRISE looks to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic, bold, gritty, high-rick exploration of space.<br /><br />I would have selected <PERSON>Adrian Paul</PERSON> to play the Captain and an older human to be the doctor. Still, I liked the actors for the most part. <PERSON>Linda Park</PERSON>, an outstanding ballroom dancer from <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION>, is sure to develop nicely. The characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created.<br /><br />ENTERPRISE begins its run stronger than did the past three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
992 0 Imagine you're a high-school boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend. How bad would a movie have to be, in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended? This movie is that bad. Really. Movies often become so bad that they're good; this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness. It is painfully bad. Horribly, terribly, crime-against-humanity bad.
993 1 Enterprise is the entertainment, but it is also the forefront of Science Fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow. With gratitude and respect Mr. <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON>Braga</PERSON>. I wish you well, thank you both for your service to Trek.<br /><br />Enterprise is what Trek is about...
994 0 This is a really dumb movie. It could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't.<br /><br />Some aliens hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. These aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. Other than the aliens, the acting is terrible. The writing is obviously meant for children, because every character is written like a kid.<br /><br />This is a dumb movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe.<br /><br />My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild language.
995 1 Call me adolescent but I really do think that this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, <PERSON>Archer</PERSON>'s adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...The music is catchy too. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile.
996 0 I saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny. I saw it again last week, and you can guess the result. Some funny parts in it, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me.<br /><br />If you want a total b-movie this is a good pick, but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size
997 1 This is what I was expecting when star trek DS9 premiered. Not to slight DS9. That was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is that show. While having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways. It makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again. And that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members. Viewers really cared deeply for the crew. Enterprise has much promise in this area as well. The chemistry between <PERSON>Bakula</PERSON> and <PERSON>Blalock</PERSON> seems very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical. I think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television. Also, we should note the performances, <PERSON>Blalock</PERSON> is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance. The rest of the cast delivered good performances also. My only gripes are as follows. The theme. It's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking. We need something a little more grand. Doesn't have to be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. And my one other complaint. They sell too many adds. They could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters. Otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of Voyager.
998 0 The Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn Gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. In fact I am sure I will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.<br /><br />The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves special mention because it is I feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, I will at least give it a go.<br /><br />Firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact the film might as well have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.<br /><br />There are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here.<br /><br />A more suitable title would have been, 'Horny Italian Count Leads Five People to a Scary Castle and Bores us Silly for Ninety Minutes.' Yes that fits better.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling, and that guy who plays <PERSON>Seymour</PERSON> was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character....abysmal.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off. Bonus.<br /><br />Otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on Gods earth I will ever, ever, ever watch this one again.<br /><br />No word of a lie, this film could put you off motion pictures for life.
999 1 The pilot of Enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original Star Trek: A dose of realistic, flawed personalities. The Utopian characters of the Next Generation got tiring, they were so noble as to be unbelievable. I also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the Vulcans. Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs. It makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two, though I don't think it would work in the time frame of the show. The only negatives that jumped out at me were the "quick cut off the ending at 2 hours" feel of the end, which is common among many of the Trek shows. The second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin. But its not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well.<br /><br />Lets see how the next episode does.
1000 0 The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. It's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.<br /><br />The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.<br /><br />Very little happens in this film. And when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. These guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. It really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. But the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. It's a travesty. Unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. The story in general is, to say the least, uneven. The women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious.<br /><br />The whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. It doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. All we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.<br /><br />A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I cannot agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. It's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either.<br /><br />I can't recommend this to anyone.
1001 1 I, like many die-hard Trekkers (or Trekkies, i don't care!) suffered through seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", dreaming of a better show when it was over, lamenting the end of "Deep Space Nine" in 1999. prayers, answered. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, a pop-song for the intro. (I was shocked!) I can't think of anything I didn't like. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager," nobody misses you! Keep on Trekkin'!<br /><br />>
1002 0 <ORGANIZATION>La Sanguisuga Conduce</ORGANIZATION> la <PERSON>Danza</PERSON>, or The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance as I believe is it's common English title, is set on '<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>' in '1902' where the mysterious Count <PERSON>Richard Marnack</PERSON> (<PERSON>Giacomo Rossi-Stuart</PERSON>) invites soon-to-be out of work theatre actress <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> (<PERSON>Patrizia Webley</PERSON> as <PERSON>Patrizia De Rossi</PERSON>) & three more of her fellow soon-to-be out of work actress friends <PERSON>Cora</PERSON> (<PERSON>Krista Nell</PERSON>), <PERSON>Penny</PERSON> (<PERSON>Lidia Olizzi</PERSON>) & <PERSON>Rosalind</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marzia Damon</PERSON> as <PERSON>Caterina Chiani</PERSON>) to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast. At first <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON> (<PERSON>Leo Valeriano</PERSON>) goes along as well. Once there <PERSON>Count Marnack</PERSON> tells his guests that his Father & Grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife & there's a feeling of unease when it turns out that <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> looks EXACTLY the same as the current Count's wife who ran away not too long ago... Along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off...<br /><br />This Italian production was written & directed by <PERSON>Alfredo Rizzo</PERSON> & is total, complete & utter crap from start to finish. First things first lets start the criticism with the title The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance, lets examine that title because when I do I feel somewhat cheated that there aren't any Vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever, no-one 'leads' anything at anytime & there most certainly isn't any dance or dancing so don't expect any of these things. What you should expect though is a tedious, dull, boring pointless little 'giallo' that takes over an hour before anyone is killed & any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape, the first hour of La Sanguisuga Conduce la <PERSON>Danza</PERSON> is as plot less & uninteresting as anything out there. The best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft-core porn film you've ever seen, then cut most of the soft-core porn out & that just leaves bad actors, bad dubbing, bad dialogue, a tiny bit of soft-core sex & lesbianism & absolutely nothing else. Yep, it really is that bad. The mystery elements are crap, people do illogical things for no apparent reason & the overly complicated 'twist' ending is as bad as the rest of it, The Sixth Sense (1999) this ain't!<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Rozzi</PERSON> does an OK job & <ORGANIZATION>La Sanguisga Conduce</ORGANIZATION> la <PERSON>Danza</PERSON> actually has a nice look & feel to it despite it's obvious low budget, I mean there are scenes where he shows a 'storm' raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black & white! So the film jumps from bright colour to black & white whenever it cuts to the storm & back to colour again! There is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid & her friend discuss her breasts & she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments, this scene is so funny & just so unnatural that it's priceless & easily the films best moment even if a bad 70's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue! There is minimal nudity & the sex/lesbian scenes are very tame. Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a decapitated head.<br /><br />Technically the films pretty good, the period setting & production design are actually quite impressive although it's not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough. The film has a nice sense of colour & the cinematography is fine. The film is dubbed so it's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible & the dialogue is even worse than usual.<br /><br />La Sanguisuga Conduce la <PERSON>Danza</PERSON> is a terrible film, it makes no sense, it has virtually no story for over an hour, it has possibly the most misleading title ever & is really dull & boring with a confused stupid 'twist' ending. As far as Euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't waste your time, as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid. Trivia Note: the notorious (& banned in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION>) Nazi exploitation/horror film Horrifying Experiments of the S.S Last Days (1977) AKA SS Hell Camp & The Beast in Heat was directed by <PERSON>Luigi Batzella</PERSON> & he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in <LOCATION>La Sanguisuga Conduce</LOCATION> la <PERSON>Danza</PERSON>.
1003 1 I think this has the potential of being the best Star Trek series yet, I say POTENTIAL.. we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas... BUT I HOPE NOT! For those that have not seen it..SEE IT! Without that annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool.. and <PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON> was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is hot too, (Check out the decontamination scene)I gave this a FULL 10... it blows away ALL the other series openers.. I hope this goes longer than 7 years...
1004 0 This movie is not only a very bad movie, with awful actors --or presumed actors--, a bored direction and a story unattractive, it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso", directed by <PERSON>Sergio Martino</PERSON> in 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. Naturally, the scene in <PERSON>Rizzo</PERSON>'s movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in <PERSON>Martino</PERSON>'s film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that <PERSON>Rizzo</PERSON>'s movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. I think that such things are an offense to spectator.
1005 1 Ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here. Mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures. Starting with the technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. In the 35 years seince TOS premiered, the crew of Star Trek have become experts at economy.<br /><br />Ultimately, they have decided, quite rightly in my mind, to abandon the look of TOS and reverse engineered TNG et all. So what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from Star Trek II? As for the nits being picked about first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was presumed based upon comments made by <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> and <PERSON>Riker</PERSON> that <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> only met the <ORGANIZATION>Klingon</ORGANIZATION>'s in 2200. Nothing was firmly established.<br /><br />Enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while. This is what Voyager COULD have been. No series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that <ORGANIZATION>Star Trek</ORGANIZATION> has so few. So, quit gripping and enjoy.
1006 0 After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie.<br /><br />The story is simple. A mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on Friday.<br /><br />The pace is excruciating. The story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either.<br /><br />Give this one a miss.
1007 1 After 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called Star Trek Voyager I was feeling pretty numb. Next Gen and DS9 were bloody good stuff and Voyager ruined TV Trek. This opened with probably the best pilot to a Trek show. The crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts. <PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON> played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before. The rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and I think they got off to a good first season. When the show was prematurely canceled I was really disappointed. In A Mirror Darkly showed us what the cast were capable of. Pity a film or TV movie was never considered. So much back story and founding of the federation left to tell, including the onset of hostilities with the Klingons..........
1008 0 A particularly maligned example of Italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot (if anything, the alternate THE MARK OF Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), this hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of Erotica) only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout Â– actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful! Here, we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a Count Â– since he had become enamored of the leading lady, a dead-ringer for his missing spouse)! The characters are pretty much stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing hero (played by <PERSON>Giacomo Rossi-Stuart</PERSON> and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, sluttish companion (recalling Mae West and emerging the most annoying of the lot!), a meek but devoted stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous <PERSON>Luciano Pigozzi</PERSON> who, for once, gets in on the action, if you know what I mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star <PERSON>Femi Benussi</PERSON> though, for what it is worth, this is really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. While the film is not by any means unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, snail's pace, shoddy production (with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not help matters. Besides, <PERSON>Marcello Giombini</PERSON>'s score, though pleasant in itself, comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said, the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one (considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here).
1009 1 Okay, the recent history of <ORGANIZATION>Star Trek</ORGANIZATION> has not been good. The Next Generation faded in its last few seasons, DS9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before, and Voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise. So, when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And, the first episode, Broken Bow, did have some problems. But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp.<br /><br />I'll get the nits out of the way first. The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for. What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. They need to cut that nonsense out.<br /><br />But, the plot was strong and moved along well. The characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme. I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the <PERSON>Borg</PERSON> show up?<br /><br />All in all, the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. We have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How did the <ORGANIZATION>Federation</ORGANIZATION> form and just who put Earth in charge. Why is the prime directive so important? If they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes, this will be an interesting series.<br /><br />My favorite line: <PERSON>Zephram Cochran</PERSON> saying "where no man has gone before" (not "no one")
1010 0 Wow-this one sucks. I'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible.Â <br /><br />A count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. Some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-The End.<br /><br />The only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few brief nudie shots. And believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. In fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. As everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no bloodsucking, nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. It may as well have been called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. An accurate title would have been '90 Minutes of Torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. Honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely...) so I highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious. Â I can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10Â 
1011 1 A very good start. I was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: It should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes across as a little too human. She needs to school on <PERSON>Spock</PERSON> who, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they couldn't have picked <PERSON>Jeri Ryan</PERSON>. I like Ms. <PERSON>Park</PERSON>, the Korean(?)lady. The doctor has possibilities. Haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. He's a really likeable. <PERSON>Bakula</PERSON> needs to find his niche--In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics. The heavies were OK, although I didn't like their make-up.
1012 0 (aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance)<br /><br />Lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in. The film is supposed to take place in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> but it looks more like <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Adriatic</LOCATION> to me.<br /><br />Gothic lesbians get invited to a Count's island castle for the weekend. One by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.<br /><br />It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit. Go figure...(sic)<br /><br />Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity. Directed by euro horror actor <PERSON>Alfredo Rizzo</PERSON>, this is one snoozer.<br /><br />Pretty boring 2 out of 10
1013 1 A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for "Enterprise," the "prequel" to the original "Star Trek" series. It stumbles a few times into "Trek" convention and clichÃ©--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and I can already foresee snickering references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan"--but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well-drawn, and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. <PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON> hits the right note as a captain with <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON>'s brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. The writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift, it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which I hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.
1014 0 In contrast to my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something redeeming in any film I see.Yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping.Something must be lost in the translation of the word "Bloodsucker" from the Italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a Gothic Vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so tacked it onto the film anyway.<br /><br />This film made in 1975 has recently been issued on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film!Now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - Italian softporn from the mid 1970s.I bought it because I am attracted to <PERSON>Christa Nelli</PERSON> (credited most often as "<PERSON>Krista Nell</PERSON>").The absence of a cast of characters I find most frustrating in a lot of these Eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s.I had hoped <ORGANIZATION>Imdb</ORGANIZATION> would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned.I think <PERSON>Krista Nell</PERSON> played "<PERSON>Cora</PERSON>" but underneath that massive hair style, costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure.<br /><br />There is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out.Maybe something is lost in the dubbing process.What were the positive points?Well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there.The external locations used were good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island.It purports to be set in "<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>" (North or the Republic?)in 1902, so everyone sports period piece costumes.Some of the scenes I found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!Anyway an enjoyable romp.I rated it 4/10.
1015 1 Enterprise, the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'Broken Bow'. First we are swept into a massive action sequence with a Klingon being chased by some Suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show). From there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time.<br /><br />The opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of Enterprise fans, whom some believe that the song is out of place. What they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. If one listens to the actual song, instead of the theme, then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together. And eventually as the series progresses further and further, and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew, will the song actually become meaningful. Overall <PERSON>Diane Warren</PERSON>'s theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer <PERSON>Russell Watson</PERSON>.<br /><br />What makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered. Enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since The Next Generation. Choosing <PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON>, as Captain <PERSON>Jonathan Archer</PERSON> was the best decision since <PERSON>Gene</PERSON> himself cast <PERSON>Patrick Stewart</PERSON> as <PERSON>Jean-Luc Picard</PERSON>. As the captain always leads the show, <PERSON>Bakula</PERSON> adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins. He simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch. As for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is <PERSON>John Billingsley</PERSON> who plays Dr. <PERSON>Phlox</PERSON>. It's also nice to see a non-human playing a role, and the decision to give the captain a dog, named 'Porthos' was a well-received idea. Throughout the show character development was brilliant, it was fast, well timed and almost perfect. I say almost because sadly <PERSON>Travis Mayweather</PERSON>'s character played by the Briton <PERSON>Anthony Montgomery</PERSON> is a little weak at the end of the first season. He does have some things to say here and there, but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important. <PERSON>Jolene Blalock</PERSON> is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable <PERSON>Subcommander T'Pol</PERSON>. <PERSON>Dominic Keating</PERSON> as Lieutenant <PERSON>Malcolm Reed</PERSON> plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer. <PERSON>Connor Trinneer</PERSON> plays Commander <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> "Trip" Tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally <PERSON>Linda Park</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ensign Hoshi Sato</PERSON>, who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting. All of these characters make up Enterprise, and all bring a quality that <ORGANIZATION>Star Trek</ORGANIZATION> hasn't seen in a long time. Each person makes this show worth watching. Smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship Enterprise NX-01.<br /><br />The ship itself, the NX-01 is somewhat questionable in design. The series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before Captain <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON>. So why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the <PERSON>Akira</PERSON> class starship? Continuity has been an issue in Enterprise, but thankfully <PERSON>Rick [Berman</PERSON>] and <PERSON>Brannon [Braga</PERSON>] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them. Continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details. If you see the show with and open mind, then you'll have no problems, but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time. So what did <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Braga</PERSON> offer to the <ORGANIZATION>Star Trek</ORGANIZATION> fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? According to them the NX-01 is how it is because of the incident in First Contact. When <PERSON>Zefram Cochrane</PERSON> saw the Enterprise-E through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by Commander <PERSON>Riker</PERSON>, it changed the ideas in his head. That's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on. Of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer, some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer. Come on guys grow up.When <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> destroyed the Star Wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway. And then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all. If you can't accept a quality show for what it is, not what it should be in your mind, then go elsewhere. Or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do.<br /><br />The sets on Enterprise remind me very much of the Defiant from <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Nine</ORGANIZATION>. They often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military. Perhaps that why the crew of the USS Enterprise (aka flagship of the American fleet) like it so much. They are striking sets, and represent the show perfectly.<br /><br /><PERSON>Rick Berman</PERSON> 'the overlord of the empire' as <PERSON>John Logan</PERSON> so accurately put it and his counterpart <PERSON>Brannon Braga</PERSON> has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have, and in all the right places. Whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score. Enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses. The late <PERSON>Gene Roddenberry</PERSON> would be proud of this series and as a Star Trek fan, so should you.
1016 0 Early film directed by <PERSON>D.W. Griffith</PERSON>; it features a gloriously happy King (<PERSON>Arthur V. Johnson</PERSON>) and his Queen (<PERSON>Marion Leonard</PERSON>) - but, wait! When the King leaves the scene, his Queen makes music with the palace's Minstrel (<PERSON>Henry B. Walthall</PERSON>). When the King discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific <PERSON>Edgar Allen Poe-type</PERSON> revenge. It's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" look very staged. The performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /><br />*** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) <PERSON>D.W.

1017 1 In 2151, in <LOCATION>Broken Bow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, a farmer shoots the <PERSON>Klingon Klaang</PERSON> with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the Klingon is sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Starfleet Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. The Vulcan ambassador <PERSON>Soval</PERSON> proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of <LOCATION>Klaang</LOCATION> to his warrior empire in planet Kronos with honor. However, Captain <PERSON>Jonathan Archer</PERSON> proposes to go with the Enterprise in her first voyage and bring back <PERSON>Klaang</PERSON> alive to his home planet. <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> invites <PERSON>Ensign Hoshi Sato</PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON>Phlox</PERSON>, who is treating <PERSON>Klaang</PERSON>, to complete his crew, and the Vulcan <PERSON>Sub-Commander T'Pol</PERSON> is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of Enterprise. When the equipment of the starship is shut-down, <LOCATION>Klaang</LOCATION> is kidnapped by Sulibans after a shooting in the hospital. After the autopsy of the Suliban killed in the shooting, Captain <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> is informed by Dr. <PERSON>Phlox</PERSON> that the alien was actually a mutant, altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track the Suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet <PERSON>Riger</PERSON> X. They investigate and disclose that <PERSON>Klaang</PERSON> was a courier, bringing an important message about the Temporal Cold War from the Suliban Sarin to the leaders of the Klingons in <LOCATION>Kronos</LOCATION>.<br /><br />In spite of being a huge fan of Star Trek, I have not followed the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable television. I have decided to buy the DVD box of the First Season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first Enterprise, Captain <PERSON>Jonathan Archer</PERSON>, the gorgeous T'Pol, <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mayweather</PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON>Phlox</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hoshi</PERSON> and Trip is excellent, at least in this pilot. I have noted in IMDb that this episode is actually divides in two parts, but on DVD they are just one, therefore my review is valid for both. I did not like the music score theme, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "Broken Bow"
1018 0 This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.<br /><br />I find "The Wooden Horse" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very plain way. It's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. The first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. The latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! I am disappointed by "The Wooden Horse", it wasted the potential to be a great film.
1019 1 "Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON>, <PERSON>Spock</PERSON> and <PERSON>McCoy</PERSON>. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise, is in my opinion the first series since "TOS" to recapture the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "Going Where No Man Has Gone Before". <PERSON>Scott Bakula</PERSON> is perfectly cast as <PERSON>Jonathan Archer</PERSON>, the first Captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. <PERSON>John Billingsley</PERSON> is Brilliant as the alien Dr. <PERSON>Phlox</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jolene Blalock</PERSON> is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks, and I believe <PERSON>Gene Roddenberry</PERSON> would surely be proud.
1020 0 This is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialog is written in clichÃ©s; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of <PERSON>Rod Cameron</PERSON>. The "choreography" is silly and wholly unerotic. One can only pity the reviewer who saw 23-year-old <PERSON>Yvonne</PERSON>'s dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography. The ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous. If you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>'s turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colorized version on VHS, making the movie even worse. <PERSON>Yvonne</PERSON>'s heavy makeup, when colored, has her looking like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this film. What a way to launch a career.
1021 1 I just watched this for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten both how imaginative the images were, and how witty the movie is. I had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are (with the scene at the <ORGANIZATION>Candlelight Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Waterloo Bridge</LOCATION>) among the most romantic ever filmed.<br /><br />Anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's offhand references - anyone interested in romance will be moved by <PERSON>Hunter-Niven</PERSON>, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworld.<br /><br />My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" made near the same time - but this one is superb. <br /><br />
1022 0 I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then.Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good.Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to shave cost and time.But every one was having such a good time who cared!
1023 1 I first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before the days of cable and satellite) MatinÃ©e. i was off School with the Mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film. i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a DVD copy of it. <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the Oscars came around. i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> or <PERSON>Anthony Hopkins</PERSON>. the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as <PERSON>Roger Livesy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marius Goring</PERSON> and an early appearance from <PERSON>Richard Attenborough</PERSON>.
1024 0 It occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films. I'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging, controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your sanity. If they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace". This film is awful with a capital 'A'. It is the worst film <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON> ever starred in.... quite a feat for for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" on his CV!<br /><br />The wafer-thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer Stroker Ace (<ORGANIZATION>Reynolds</ORGANIZATION>), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter <PERSON>Clyde Torkle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ned Beatty</PERSON>). The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing up as a giant chicken. Thrown into the mix are Lugs (<PERSON>Jim Nabors</PERSON>), Ace's dim-witted pal, and <PERSON>Pembrook Feeney</PERSON> (<PERSON>Loni Anderson</PERSON>), a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by Ace.<br /><br /><PERSON>Hal Needham</PERSON>, the director of this low-grade garbage, was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases/races. Some of these films were OK, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he reaches a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them. <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair. The humour is weak and infantile throughout, and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable. Even the out-takes during the closing credits (which can be found in all the <LOCATION>Reynolds-Needham</LOCATION> collaborations) are generally unfunny, which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make. "Stroker Ace" is a stinker of considerable magnitude.
1025 1 "Stairway to Heaven" is a outstanding invention of movie making, probably never duplicated. I rank it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen," although it is a totally different type of movie than "African Queen." "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. <br /><br />For example, there is the combination of B&W and color footage - as in "Oz," but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in "Oz." In "Stairway" the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful.<br /><br />Another brilliant aspect of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still Â– literally? And then there is the <LOCATION>Stairway</LOCATION> itself!<br /><br />If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a true gem.
1026 0 <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON> came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions. He'd show up, party with his friends on film, and take home a big paycheck. It didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap.<br /><br />No film epitomized this more than "Stroker Ace" which makes "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball Run II" look watchable. Save for a few race scenes there is absolutely NOTHING worth seeing here. Even the beautiful <PERSON>Loni Anderson</PERSON> hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing.<br /><br />If the thought of <PERSON>Burt</PERSON> hamming it up with <ORGANIZATION>Jim Nabors</ORGANIZATION> and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie. Otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse.
1027 1 <br /><br />Filmed just after the war, this story was made in order to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. It ended up receiving the honour of being the first Royal Premiere after WWII.<br /><br />Remarkably the film tangles together the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sigmund Freud</PERSON> Psychology, the Founding fathers of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and various others up the long stairs (special effects in its infancy) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity. <br /><br />Although sounding absurd, this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since. <br /><br />Be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story. <PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON> acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!! <br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>British Cinema</ORGANIZATION> should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years.<br /><br />
1028 0 This is one of the most insipid, lackluster, unoriginal, and pointless movies ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best film of them all. As for this waste of film stock, <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON> sleepwalks his way through the entire movie, <PERSON>Jim Nabors</PERSON> is wasted, the other actors aren't given very much to do, the car races are obviously stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it.
1029 1 Surely one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made anywhere. Script, cinematography, direction and acting in a class on their own. This film works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never shown on TV? Why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the <ORGANIZATION>National Film Theatre</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to packed houses?
1030 0 Oh man is this movie bad. It flows horribly. The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself, and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this, doesn't love himself. He tries getting out of the contract and horrible, painfully unfunny gags ensue. <PERSON>Jim Nabors</PERSON> seems as if he's sleepwalking, not acting. You'll miss such <PERSON>Burt</PERSON> sidekicks as <PERSON>Dom Deluise</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Reed</PERSON> while watching this stinker. <PERSON>Loni Anderson</PERSON>'s hair is downright scary, proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of, <PERSON>Burt</PERSON>'s wig wasn't bad in this film. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". Anyhow, this movie is the worst <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds</ORGANIZATION> car movie, ever, ever, right up there with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, thankfully, had no sequel) are great, funny films. This one isn't. Even <PERSON>Ned Beatty</PERSON>, who is a great actor, stinks. You'll long for a <PERSON>Jackie Gleason</PERSON> type villain who is fun to hate. And mind you, this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on. It's lousy, pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. And least I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal <PERSON>Burt</PERSON>'s coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in "Boogie Nights", another film that, like "Deliverance" years earlier, shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.
1031 1 I remember the first time I saw this movie -- I was in the office working over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise. But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I'd never seen or heard of, until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title -- Stairway to Heaven in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one superbly-written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package. It's a classic that really does rank right up there with <LOCATION>Casablanca</LOCATION>, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire. WHY has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence? Fortunately, SOME knowledgeable critics HAVE put it on their "Top 100 of all time" lists. There IS hope -- 1940's Fantasia wasn't a hit 'til the '60s, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV. Buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it! You WON'T be disappointed!
1032 0 Ever notice how in his later movies <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON>' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?<br /><br />Must have been hanging out with <PERSON>Hal Needham</PERSON> too much.<br /><br />And from the looks of "Stroker Ace", WAY too much.<br /><br />Can you believe this was based on a book? Neither could I, but it was. And probably not a best-seller, I'll wager. <br /><br /><PERSON>Burt</PERSON>'s another good-old-boy in the <ORGANIZATION>NASCAR</ORGANIZATION> circuit who hitches up with <PERSON>Beatty</PERSON> as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team. <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> provides what love interest there is and <ORGANIZATION>Nabors</ORGANIZATION> does his umpteenth <PERSON>Gomer Pyle</PERSON> impression as faithful mechanic/best friend Lugs. <br /><br />A lot of people here are friends of <PERSON>Burt</PERSON>'s or <PERSON>Hal</PERSON>'s. Others must have needed the work. And even real <ORGANIZATION>NASCAR</ORGANIZATION> drivers get in on the act, and look to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /><br />As far as laughs go, <PERSON>Bubba Smith</PERSON> (pre-"Police Academy") gets them as <PERSON>Beatty</PERSON>'s chauffeur. And <PERSON>Petersen</PERSON>, in full <PERSON>Elvira</PERSON> mode, gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs real well. REAL WELL.<br /><br />It's a shame that <PERSON>Burt</PERSON> threw away as much time and effort in a film like "Stroker Ace" where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not. They didn't bother to write a character for him, why bother to act?<br /><br />Two stars. Mostly for <PERSON>Petersen</PERSON>, and for the out-takes at the end. Now THEY'RE funny.
1033 1 One of the few best films of all time. The change from Black and white to colour for the Heaven and Earth Sequences was Directorial excellence.<br /><br />The Plot is extremely clever, the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions, and although a war film it doesn't discriminate. I must have seen this film more times than any other, and I never tire of it. It is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise.
1034 0 "The Return of Chandu" is notable, if one can say that, for the casting of <PERSON>Bela Lugosi</PERSON> as the hero rather than the villain. Why he even gets the girl.<br /><br /> The story as such, involves the <ORGANIZATION>Black Magic Cult of Ubasti</ORGANIZATION> trying to capture the last Egyptian princess <PERSON>Nadji</PERSON> (the delectable <PERSON>Maria Alba</PERSON>) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like <PERSON>Nadji</PERSON>. <PERSON>Lugosi</PERSON> as <PERSON>Chandu</PERSON>, who possesses magical powers, tries to thwart the villains.<br /><br /> Director <PERSON>Ray Taylor</PERSON> does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage. Fans of <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION> (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep <PERSON>Kong</PERSON> at bay in several scenes. The acting is for the most part, awful. The actor who plays the high priest (I believe <PERSON>Lucien Prival</PERSON>) for example, uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies. The less said about the others the better.<br /><br /> It is a mystery why <PERSON>Lugosi</PERSON> accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career, because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time. Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl, who knows. As his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s, this kind of fare would become the norm for <PERSON>Lugosi</PERSON> rather than the exception.<br /><br />
1035 1 <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s greatest movie. <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> plays the <ORGANIZATION>RAF</ORGANIZATION> bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is AWOL and dispatches an angel to investigate. The scene when the young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant. Watch out too for <PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON>, a deeply under appreciated actor, and <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON> as the love interest (later, of course, <PERSON>Zira</PERSON> in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> cast the actress who played the chief angel (<PERSON>Kathleen Byron</PERSON>) as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in Saving Private <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> half a century later, an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy.
1036 0 <PERSON>Bela Lugosi</PERSON> is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the lead as <PERSON>Frank Chandler/Chandu</PERSON> the Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of <LOCATION>White Magic</LOCATION> pushed against those of Black, while displaying vigourous fighting skill, successfully wooing a young Egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear, complete with nautical cap. The somewhat lumpy plot engages Chandler/Chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee, Princess <PERSON>Nadji</PERSON>(<PERSON>Maria Alba</PERSON>) and others from the clutches of the idol-worshipping sect of <LOCATION>Ubasti</LOCATION>, which covets <PERSON>Nadji</PERSON>'s blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of <LOCATION>Lemuria</LOCATION>. Director <PERSON>Ray Taylor</PERSON>, an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly, but repeated scenes and footage, a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's <LOCATION>Skull Island</LOCATION> setting from <LOCATION>KING KONG</LOCATION>, and the port locale from <LOCATION>SON OF KONG</LOCATION>, reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one-half hours and, if viewed at one sitting, becomes lacking in effect to most viewers, unless insomniac.
1037 1 Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. During WWII British <PERSON>Peter Carter</PERSON>'s (<PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>) plane is shot down in combat but he survives. He meets and falls in love with lovely June (<PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON>). But it seems a mistake was made in Heaven--he should have died! A French spirit comes to get him but he refuses. He is soon to plead his case in front of a Heavenly Tribunal that he should be allowed to live.<br /><br />Sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film. The script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight-faced and it's beautifully directed--the scenes on Earth are in breath-taking Technicolor (I've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in Heaven are in black and white! <PERSON>Niven</PERSON> is a little stiff at times but <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> is just great (and very beautiful) and <PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON> is superb as a doctor trying to help <PERSON>Niven</PERSON>. The imagery throughout is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence) and the special effects are truly great (considering the age of the film). There's also a very strange sequence when <PERSON>Niven</PERSON> runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought provoking film--highly recommended. This remains unknown in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> which is a shame.
1038 0 At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin. But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs. They've done the gross out movies. They've done the let's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /><br />This film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it.
1039 1 I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. It's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time. It's difficult to believe this was made in 1946, as the tale is still fresh today, and really makes one think. I'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made. In addition, the acting is superb, and the use of English and American actors quite astounding. I recently purchased the DVD so now I'm able to watch whenever I wish. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this.
1040 0 After we counted the use of the f word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film, listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse, and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together, well, we turned it off. Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers. <br /><br />We did give it a second chance, thinking surely it would get better. No dice. Later, my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved, still no dice.<br /><br />The main character did have a cool bike.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents, or frat boys.
1041 1 My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful <PERSON>RAYMOND MASSEY</PERSON> is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.<br /><br /><PERSON>David NIVEN</PERSON> and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it's <PERSON>ROGER LIVESEY</PERSON> who gives the liveliest and most credible performance. French accented <PERSON>MARIUS GORING</PERSON> is a delight (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim <PERSON>Niven</PERSON> when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. <PERSON>Goring</PERSON> has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.<br /><br />Seeing this tonight on <ORGANIZATION>TCM</ORGANIZATION> for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and <PERSON>Niven</PERSON>'s tense talk with radio operator <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another triumph for <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Emeric Pressburger</PERSON>.
1042 0 Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (<PERSON>Carrell</PERSON>) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed.
1043 1 This is probably one of the most original love stories I have seen for ages, especially for a war based (briefly) film. Basically it is a story based in two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place. Anyway, <PERSON>Peter Carter</PERSON> (the great <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>) was going to crash in a plane, he talked to June (Planet of the Apes' <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON>) before he bailed out and said he loved her. He was meant to die from jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he is seeing and loving June in the flesh. This other place, like a heaven, is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world, so they send French Conductor 71 (<PERSON>Marius Goring</PERSON>) to persuade him to go, but he is obviously in love. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court, he is granted this. Obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other, June even offers to take his place! Also starring <PERSON>Robert Coote</PERSON> as <PERSON>Bob Trubshawe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kathleen Byron</PERSON> as An Angel, a brief (then unknown) Lord Sir <PERSON>Richard Attenborough</PERSON> as An English Pilot and <PERSON>Abraham Sofaer</PERSON> as The Judge/The Surgeon. <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> was number 36 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 47 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 46 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!
1044 0 About 15 minutes in, my wife was already wanting to leave. Not so much because of the material, but the lack thereof. They decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. When this would let up (very rare), we'd sit back and watch (not laughing, mind you) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark(s). After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we'd read said how great this was. The trailer looked good and <PERSON>Roger Ebert</PERSON> actually called it "intelligent" and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever walked out on...and I have no regrets. I'm sick of trying to go see comedies in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
1045 1 A wonderful film by <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON>, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another. Beautifully shot and acted, although <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Fun to see a very young <PERSON>Richard Attenborough</PERSON>. This film made me think, while I was watching it, and afterwards.
1046 0 It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today. maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties, and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation, and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie, since so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found the gay jokes, not only not funny but downright offensive ( I'm not gay). The main character in the movie is not even a likable person, just pathetic. When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see.
1047 1 Why is this movie not in the 250 best? This movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of W.W.II because of the perception of the nearness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment. And what after life? I liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (<PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> Sofaer-a typical British judge-), Doctor <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> (<PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON>) defending <PERSON>Peter Carter</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>) and also June (<PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON>) against the American prosecutor <PERSON>Abraham Farlan</PERSON> (<PERSON>Raymond Massey</PERSON> I -there is a reason why it is an American-). It is all so imaginative! <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON> wrote, directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real "tour-de-force". The message of the movie is clear: in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans. The way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood-movie could ever make.
1048 0 "The 40 Year Old Virgin" exists in a world I don't understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "f*** off" and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded. A world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples' cars. A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings. A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without any funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with, and stretched out beyond all rational thought. The chest-waxing scene went on FOREVER.<br /><br />The characters, aside from <PERSON>Carell</PERSON>, were totally one-note. And the romantic elements were completely contrived, particularly the scene where <PERSON>Keener</PERSON> finds porn in <PERSON>Carell</PERSON>'s apartment. That was just lame.<br /><br />And I also found the "Aquarius" sequence totally annoying and excessive. I hated hated hated this movie!
1049 1 I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, <LOCATION>Casablanca</LOCATION>, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely high by <ORGANIZATION>IMDB</ORGANIZATION> voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie gets released on DVD for Region 1 (<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>), so that 1), I can purchase it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
1050 0 I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little. "Groundbreaking" is a little over the top. This is a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film. It's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. A silly action film without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it. Not something you will ever see unless you are a student at <PERSON>Emerson</PERSON> college.
1051 1 Just after the end of <ORGANIZATION>WWII Powell & Pressburger</ORGANIZATION> were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> & the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION>. At the time there was a lot of "Overpaid, over sexed and over here" type of comments. Somehow they came up with this masterpiece.<br /><br />My favourite movie of ALL time. It's got everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout.<br /><br />Was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script ? Who knows. But *DO* watch it and you'll see what I mean.
1052 0 Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read, Evening is a gorgeously produced failure...until <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff. <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON> is shockingly off in her role as the dying <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> is a cipher. Perhaps if <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> that gave her entrÃ©e to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> actually was dying. <br /><br />I was hoping the addition of <PERSON>Michael Cunningham</PERSON> to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas. It gave me a headache.
1053 1 If ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form, you can do worse than pointing them at this movie.<br /><br />Quite simply it is the perfect combination of story, script, actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid.<br /><br />The story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the English fog during the second world war, and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities (or is it in his head) is played with panache by <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON> and is incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot (<PERSON>Niven</PERSON>) describes his plight to the ground radio operator (Hunter).<br /><br />The sense of otherworldliness is heightened by <PERSON>Jack Cardiff</PERSON>'s photography and the incredible production designs.<br /><br />The supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in <LOCATION>Technicolour</LOCATION> - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic <PERSON>Marius Goring</PERSON>).<br /><br />Not only a highpoint in British cinema, but a highpoint in cinema, period.
1054 0 Cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less. <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON> is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love...<br /><br />This is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is. Not bad as such but with <PERSON>Redgrave</PERSON>, <PERSON>Toni Collette</PERSON>, <PERSON>Glenn Close</PERSON>, <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clare Danes</PERSON>,<PERSON>Natasha Richardson</PERSON>,<PERSON>Eileen Atkins</PERSON>, <PERSON>Patrick Wilson</PERSON>,<PERSON>Hugh Darcy</PERSON> and others (all giving fine performances) you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance.<br /><br />Wait for Cable.
1055 1 It is no surprise that writer/director <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON> considered "A Matter of Life and Death," his and <PERSON>Emeric Pressburger</PERSON>'s spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together. Released during the aftermath of World War 2, this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised, recovering nation in need of a good uplift.<br /><br />Following a string of other patriotic war films, 'The Archers' made this one their quirkiest, skittish and most patriotic of the lot. Quintessentially British for upholding British heritage (<PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also visibly Americanised in its baroque compositions, technical inventiveness and a fine multi-ethnic cast.<br /><br />Oddly echoing another 1946 classic, "It's a Wonderful Life," AMOLAD opens on a grand firmament, with one of those jolly voice-overs preaching about the earth and the heavens, and what a big, wonderful world we live in. <br /><br />It then cuts to the inside of a British cockpit, badly hit, up in flames and with the co-pilot already dead. It sounds misconceived, but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow.<br /><br />Clocking in at nearly 5 minutes, the rapid-fire exchange between British pilot <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>) and American radio contact June (<PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON>) is breathtaking in its intimacy. Resigned to dying, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour, charm and outpouring confessions, and his warm affiliation with June closes with a mutual exchange of 'I love you.' <br /><br />Keeping with the magic of the moment, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, by oversight of his Conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'Other World,' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach. He later encounters June riding a bicycle, and instantly matches the body with the voice. <br /><br />But realising their error, the high court want <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> sent back, and order the French Conductor (<PERSON>Maurice Goring</PERSON>) down to earth to retrieve him. But <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is adamant to live because of June and the Conductor's mistake, and wilfully guards his corner.<br /><br /><PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and American prosecutor (<PERSON>Raymond Massey</PERSON>), whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh British delegates. The surreal trial, which dissolves from b/w back into rich Technicolor, once the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome.<br /><br />The abstract, frame filling "stairway to heaven" (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in b/w, when it elevates <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and his enigmatic French guardian upwards, crossing giant statues of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s potential attorneys for the trial, including <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> and <PERSON>Plato</PERSON>. The second time, the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema - <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and June frozen side-by-side, their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame, their fate sealed.<br /><br />The unlikely affection shared between <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and June never turns mushy or verbose; it's treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love, so it can keep them together. <br /><br />The French Conductor, who can freeze time and people's bodies, obtrudes many of their key moments together, lecturing <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> about history and among his mischievous tricks, pinching <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s 'Top 100 Game Tricks' book and his coffee cup.<br /><br />As visually inspired as other Powell/Pressburger collaborations, this was the first time they combined colour with b/w Â– the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes, and both are equally captivating. <br /><br />The outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design, with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn't feel like it was written or performed for the screen. Amusing and witty, Powell/Pressburger's writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition.<br /><br />Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that defies it age, looking fresh and inventive, even in this age where CGI would vamp up its artificial effects, probably stripping them of their emotional wonder. <br /><br />Other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s predicament.
1056 0 I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel (especially a beloved one, like Evening) but when I saw that the book's author, <PERSON>Susan Minot</PERSON>, was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film, I thought that Evening would be a good adaptation.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with this movie. It is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.<br /><br />Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>. <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> is the son of the housekeeper. Buddy is a drunk, in love with <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> and/or <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>. I don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.<br /><br />And, really, didn't we learn from Bridges of <LOCATION>Madison County</LOCATION> that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in, to scenes of our heroes' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights, simply does not work on film? This film is a disaster. Skip it.
1057 1 If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as <PERSON>Adolph Hitler</PERSON> on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and I guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . In fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect , beauty and soul of <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON>'s masterpiece . The scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? Again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . <ORGANIZATION>RAF</ORGANIZATION> bomber command lost 58,000 men during the war , the same number that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> lost in 'Nam but during a shorter period and a far , far smaller pool of active combatants , there's no atheists in a fox hole and I doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . When <PERSON>Richar Attenborough</PERSON>'s young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war . Also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> passing through the pearly gates . it's obvious Nazis don't go to heaven <br /><br />The plot itself where dashing young pilot <PERSON>Peter Carter</PERSON> arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext , you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it's replaced by American ambitions . There's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of American history and culture . One is the ethnic mix of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , even today many Britons think that the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> is overwhelmingly composed of <ORGANIZATION>White Anglo Saxon Protestants</ORGANIZATION> when in fact only 51% of Americans are " White European " . The film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess " I am an American " as <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is judged by <PERSON>Abraham Farlan</PERSON> , an Anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by British forces in The American War Of Independence . As for the " special relationship " between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> - What special relationship ? <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> know their history when it comes to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . They obviously know their future too <br /><br />So remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . It's strange , beautiful , poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . Can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a British soldier killed in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> ?
1058 0 This is, without a doubt, the most offensive "chick flick" I have seen in years, if not ever. The writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody. Before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster, we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all of your problems, "performer types" are miserable messes, & musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast & some great-looking sets & costumes. When <PERSON>Natasha Richardson</PERSON> told <PERSON>Toni Collette</PERSON> that unless she lives a more mainstream life, she'll end up - shudder - "alone!", I felt queasy. I can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release. It's the sort of fare one expects from those "women's" cable channels that I always pass right by when channel-surfing. I am female and over 35, so I should be part of this film's target audience, but boy, does "Evening" miss its target.
1059 1 This is one of the most overlooked gems <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> has ever produced. -- A young WWII British fighter ace whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that within minutes he will be dead. For some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven. When a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and demands to have his "day in court" to argue his case. The man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life, that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person, one who deserved a chance to live on. <br /><br />The "heavenly court" is a cinematic delight! The "announcement of the jury of peers" is a definite highlight. The story, as fantastic as it seems, is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This film is in my personal all-time favorite top 10, it has my highest recommendation!
1060 0 I saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening, and I must say I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> in the lead role. Depending on what you think about <PERSON>Danes</PERSON>, she was either horribly miscast, or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead, she is completely unlikeable. The other "great" actresses do an OK job, but certainly don't light up the screen. Out of all the "great" actresses in this movie, I'd say the one who did the best job was <PERSON>Natasha Richardson</PERSON>. Streep is barely in the picture, and only appears near the very end.<br /><br />Horrible screenplay as well. It comes off more as them reading lines than truly being "in character."
1061 1 The great talents of <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Emeric Pressberger</PERSON> are noticeable in their wonderful "A Matter of Life and Death". It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> that played at the <PERSON>Walter Reade</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films from that, or any other era.<br /><br />"A Matter of Life and Death" has a brilliant cinematography by <PERSON>Jack Cardiff</PERSON>, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven, and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth. This was quite a coup, and well ahead of its times. The black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and the Conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film.<br /><br />Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment will be about the great acting <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressberger</PERSON> got out of the large, distinguished cast, who responded magnificently to the directors' guidance.<br /><br /><PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>, is <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it. This film marked one of the highlights in Mr. <PERSON>Niven</PERSON>'s career. He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie. <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON> is surprisingly good as June, the woman who talked to <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> as his plane was falling from the skies. As fate would have it, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and June fall in love at first sight.<br /><br />Some of the best British film actors grace this film with their presence. <PERSON>Robert Coote</PERSON>, is <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, the man who is admitted to heaven, but he is surprised his friend <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> never made the trip with him. An excellent star turn by <PERSON>Marius Goring</PERSON>, who as the Conductor 71 steals the film. Mr. <PERSON>Goring</PERSON>, who had worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie. Also, <PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON>, as Dr. <PERSON>Frank Reeves</PERSON>, does one of the best appearances of his career, as well as <PERSON>Raymond Massey</PERSON>, who is seen as <PERSON>Abraham Farlan</PERSON>.<br /><br />"A Matter of Life and Death" is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators.
1062 0 With a cast list like this one, I expected far better. <PERSON>Venessa Redgrave</PERSON> spent the majority of the movie lying in bed. The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie. The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death. The thing is, she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy. All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary. It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase suspense, or from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters. Either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything. It was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none. I left wondering why good movies can't be written for women. It really was a disappointment.
1063 1 This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I've seen this movie for the first time a week ago, since then every day I see the opening and every time I feel as thrilled as I felt the first time I heard <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> uttering the immortal words from Sir <PERSON>Walter Raleigh</PERSON>'s The Pilgrimage:<br /><br />Give me my scallop-shell of quiet, My staff of faith to walk upon, My scrip of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My gown of glory, hope's true gage; And thus I'll take my pilgrimage (Â…)<br /><br />Do you know why it would be a truism to say <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Emeric Pressuburger</PERSON>'s lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening? Because they had been already admitted in the Paradise of Poets long before they made this movie.<br /><br />I imagine both of them facing trial during Doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate God: I beg your pardon, Sir. So, do You want to know what have we done during our lifetime? Well, well you'll see: We've written directed and produced: I know Where I'm Going, Colonel Blimp, Red ShoesÂ… do you think that enough Sir? It is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature the Muse or Whatever you may call It when they shot A Matter of Life and Death. The fact that other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody, notwithstanding I feel my life would have a meaning had I never done anything else that to see this movie.<br /><br />Of course old-timers will be tempted to say: They don't do movies like this one any more. They'll be partially mistaken; they didn't make movies like this in the past times either.<br /><br />I've have already quoted <PERSON>Keats</PERSON> here, but I'll repeat his words: A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
1064 0 Just PPV'd this. I don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could, but I did want to say a few things.<br /><br />I didn't know which was funnier: <PERSON>Redgrave</PERSON> chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse; Close wailing that her "precious" boy (whom she and the Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been turned into roadkill; that the tone-deaf <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> schmoozed with <PERSON>Peggy Lee</PERSON>; or the horrid CGI of Crypt Keeper <PERSON>Annie</PERSON> gazing at her younger self!<br /><br />I never bought <PERSON>Danes</PERSON> as the younger <PERSON>Redgrave</PERSON>. I didn't buy <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Collette</PERSON> as sisters, either. If <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON>'s daughter wants to be an actress, she better get Mama to give her a few lessons! I had zero idea why any girl (or Buddy) would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>! <PERSON>Ann</PERSON>'s daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she, <PERSON>Luc</PERSON> is a retarded slacker on crack, and I didn't give a rot about any of them! Evening gives <ORGANIZATION>Chick Flicks</ORGANIZATION> a bad name!
1065 1 Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known "death romances" such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all the cosmic scale, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderfully, determinedly romantic aspect of "Stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.
1066 0 I knew that 'Evening' was a girlie film, so I was expecting to be bored. A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive.<br /><br />Survive? Yes. I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that, for <ORGANIZATION>Yanks</ORGANIZATION>, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film.<br /><br />There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling (why do <ORGANIZATION>Yanks</ORGANIZATION> add an third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON> (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess.<br /><br />Obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy/Heathcliff character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher.<br /><br />As you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it.<br /><br />I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage.<br /><br />Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence...<br /><br />Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan. I didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties.
1067 1 I LOVE this movie. Director <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON> once stated that this was his favorite movie, and it is mine as well. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> created a seemingly simple, superbly crafted story - the power of love against "the powers that be". However, its deception lies in the complexity of its "is it real or is it imaginary" premise. Basically, one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young, poetically inclined airman during WWII. Or is it? The question is never answered one way or the other. Actually, it is never even asked. This continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal.<br /><br />The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers. For instance, <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> always wanted to do a cinematic version of <PERSON>Richard Strauss</PERSON>' opera, <PERSON>Der Rosenkavalier</PERSON>, about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat. This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71, dressed in all his finery, holds the rose (which appears silver in heaven). The music even has a dreamy quality.<br /><br />All of the acting is first rate - <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> is at his most charming, and he has excellent support from veteran <PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON> and relative newcomer <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON>. But, in my opinion, the film's charm comes from <PERSON>Marius Goring</PERSON> as Conductor 71. He by far has the most interesting role, filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness, brightening the film. It's a pity that some of Conductor 71's scenes were left on the cutting room floor. It is also a pity that <PERSON>Goring</PERSON>'s comedic talents are rarely seen again on film, except in the wonderful videos of The <ORGANIZATION>Scarlet Pimpernel</ORGANIZATION> television series from the 1950s. This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career. He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of <PERSON>Niven</PERSON>, and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters. Ironically, also in the mid -1940s, <PERSON>Niven</PERSON> also starred against another heavenly "messenger", played by <PERSON>Cary Grant</PERSON>, in The Bishop's Wife. Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring, unenergetic, and disappointing. As a note, according to <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Goring</PERSON> desperately wanted the role of <PERSON>Peter Carter</PERSON>, initially refusing Conductor 71. It's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal.<br /><br />The movie, "commissioned" to smooth over the strained relations between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, overdrives its point towards the end. But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties, both military and civilian, the need to "go on" when faced with death. There is a conspicuous lack of WWII "enemies" in heaven, but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't necessary. The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for, but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
1068 0 This crap is like watching paint dry. I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it.<br /><br />There simply is no meaning to this film. If it were never made, no one would notice or care. It's hyped up because of all the big names in it, but if "nobody's" were in, nobody would give this film any love.<br /><br />Seriously, I was at the point where half-way through the film I would look at <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON> and think, "Hurry up and die already!" This is like the "Joy Luck Club" without any of the friggin' joy. It's the "<ORGANIZATION>Ocean</ORGANIZATION>'s 13" (nothing but a big-named cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic...oh until it's finally over.<br /><br />I'm sure they'll all be nominated for Oscars...<br /><br />- 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk.
1069 1 The opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the Archers' logo, the introductory disclaimer, the way the camera pans over the cosmos. It's strange to think that `It's a Wonderful Life' came out in the same year. No great coincidence: the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered, something best passed over in silence, when placed next to <PERSON>Alfred Junge</PERSON>'s vision.<br /><br />It continues to look great all the way through, as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us. I'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general. One of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other. Not so here. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world, a mere change of palettes. Both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own.<br /><br />As for the story ... this may be <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON>'s best script, or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events. Other than that it's tight, yet with more going on than I can possibly allude to here. Was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary? (Or both? Perhaps <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> dreamt up a fantasy that was, as it so happened, true.) Everyone says we're meant to neither ask nor answer this question, but I don't see why. I'm sure we ARE meant to ask the question. The film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed, the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions. The fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn't mean that this shouldn't occupy us as well. There is, as I've said before, a lot going on.<br /><br />Consider the scene in which <PERSON>Abraham Farlan</PERSON> (Heaven's prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match, and contemptuously says, `The voice of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, 1945.' Dr. <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment, and then produces one of his own: a blues song from <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Farlan</ORGANIZATION> listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth. <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> looks smug.<br /><br />Snobbery? Well, I don't see why it's snobbish to condemn blues music - and that's not what <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON> are doing, anyway. As the song is being played, we get a shot of the American soldiers listening to it: several of them nod their heads to the rhythm, perfectly at home. THEY don't find it incomprehensible. There's something valuable about the song and neither <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION>Farlan</ORGANIZATION> knows what it is. <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> probably realises as much. All English audiences (and all Australian, Indian, etc. audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast, too; and that while <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> understands THAT, he is unable to explain it to <ORGANIZATION>Farlan</ORGANIZATION> - hence the blues broadcast, which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else. It's a clever scene.<br /><br />One last thing. I found <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> a bit cold, without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so, I don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began, as this one did.
1070 0 Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous. Not painful to watch with your significant other? I was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie. <br /><br />It was so slow and awfully strange. <br /><br />Both Redgraves,<PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> and <PERSON>Natasha</PERSON> were unfit for this, especially with <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> doing that ridiculous brash American accent. <br /><br /><PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl that she was in My So-Called Life. She has yet to push herself in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /><br /><PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> was one of the only redeeming part of this movie, she was on screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake. <br /><br />Oh! And <PERSON>Hugh Dancy</PERSON>, who gets better every time I see him. <br /><br /><PERSON>Glenn Close</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eileen Atkins</PERSON> were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /><br />I mean, this was a well-shot movie, it was very pretty, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling. <br /><br />I don't know, It's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of "The greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much. It sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (<PERSON>Ann</PERSON>) was a huge jerk. I was glad she died. But that's because I felt bad for <PERSON>Lila</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ann</PERSON>'s friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /><br />Ugh. BAD job, Evening the film. You weren't entertaining and you weren't even thought-provoking. I sure hope the book was better, so it didn't waste even more of people's time. 3/10
1071 1 A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressburger</PERSON>'s visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. The switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious, showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>)'s operation. <br /><br />All of the performances are spot on (<PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON> being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has I haven't seen it). A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of love and just how important life is. And <PERSON>Jack Cardiff</PERSON>'s cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON>'s face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why I give this film a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
1072 0 The story of a woman (<PERSON>Ann</PERSON>) on her death bed, her two daughters (<PERSON>Nina</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constance</PERSON>) and her thoughts about her past. The flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> is in the wedding of her friend <PERSON>Lila</PERSON>. At the wedding she meets <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> who will impact her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> is older, more "responsible," a mother of two and has things together. <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.<br /><br />First of all the good. The period detail in the movie is great. The dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and place. And there is some very quality acting in the movie. <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON> is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). <PERSON>Hugh Dancy</PERSON> brought a lot of life to the character of <PERSON>Lila</PERSON>'s brother <PERSON>Buddy</PERSON>.<br /><br />Now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us. The chemistry between young <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then... you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her. And I thought the whole, "he might be gay" thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose.<br /><br />Then we have <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>. The character acts wooden and creepy. Had this been another genre, you would have known that <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> was the serial killer from the get go. It is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so (but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out).<br /><br />And the grandest problem of all. Why don't <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> get together? They fall for each other. They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then...<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />They meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and I couldn't help but wondering why. WHY? The movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them.<br /><br />The part of the story in the present is fairly boring. The clichÃ© good daughter and the clichÃ© bad daughter. <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> changes over the course of the movie but I am not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> dreaming she's chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing.<br /><br />"There are no mistakes", <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> advises at us. The statement doesn't ring true with the story. And it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.
1073 1 Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is superb. <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kim Hunter</PERSON> and especially <PERSON>Roger Livesey</PERSON> do an outstanding job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, "A Matter of Life and Death".
1074 0 I went to see "Evening" because of the cast. I'd gone to see "Norman's Room" for that reason -- that movie offering <PERSON>Diane Keaton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leonardo De Caprio</PERSON> and, also, <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> -- and had loved every minute of it. Same for "The Notebook" even though it was chick-flit lite. And my feeling was, anything offering performances by <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON>, <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON>, <PERSON>Patrick Wilson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Glenn Close</PERSON> would be at least as good. Instead, I found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite, simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material.<br /><br />Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured. I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story...so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse. But while <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON>'s character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt "was a mistake" was riveting, at times, the part actually showing what that "past mistake" was does nothing to clarify the matter. In fact, it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest "girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loses boy" fashion, and in the most unbelievable, clichÃ©d, wrong-headed way possible.<br /><br />And from here be spoilers, so bear that in mind should you continue reading.<br /><br />First of all, <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> was brutally miscast. Not only does she not even begin to resemble <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON> as a young woman, she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting. Don't get me wrong, she can be good in the right role -- just not this one. And <PERSON>Patrick Wilson</PERSON> was miscast, though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off. He'd have been better suited to the part <PERSON>Hugh Dancy</PERSON> played -- the rich confused WASP -- and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all; he's a bit too WASP-y for that. <PERSON>Hugh Dancy</PERSON>? One note -- "I'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why." And the "why" (I'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died (as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties) so ludicrous, wrong-headed and mishandled, I nearly threw my candy at the screen.<br /><br />As for the modern part between <PERSON>Toni Collette</PERSON> and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister's "perfect life," her sister wondering if she's made the right choices, her pregnancy and her too-perfect boyfriend (which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by <PERSON>Patrick Wilson</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Ebon Moss-Bachrach</ORGANIZATION> might have been a more interesting <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, given his dreamy eyes) -- anyway, all this was hashed over in the 70's and 80's. And in much greater depth. Do we REALLY have to present it, again, and all as if it was fresh and momentous?<br /><br />And to top it off, <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON> doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She's still good, but only because she's Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup.<br /><br />So to put it simply, this movie has every clichÃ© in the "really meaningful message" movie book, and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out, again. At two hours long and laced with "Lifetime Movie-of-the-week" music that is guaranteed to rub you raw, it's a complete failure in both the "meaningful" and "moviemaking" aspects. I give it "3" only because of Meryl and <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON>.<br /><br />Now, if all you require from your films is twadd le, then please set my comments about "Evening" aside and have the time of your life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings, rent "Norman's Room" and find out what truly great acting is.
1075 1 To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made.<br /><br />From beginning to end it oozes class. It is stimulating, thought provoking, a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples.<br /><br />The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and <LOCATION>Technicolour</LOCATION> to accent the different worlds works seamlessly. The characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy.<br /><br />No matter how many times I watch the film - and I have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It is as fresh today as it was in 1946.<br /><br />If I were allowed just one film to keep and watch again A <ORGANIZATION>Matter of Life</ORGANIZATION> and Death would be that film.
1076 0 Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, both thinking, this has to get better, these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, hackneyed script, and listless pacing make for a long two hours. I actually couldn't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping (cat litter being more appealing than this film). The husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't get better--by the time Buddy is killed, you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep this one alive.
1077 1 Return to Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION> is Perhaps one of The Few Sequels that Can Live up to The Original. It Had Black Humor, Good Suspense, Nice Looking Girls, and Of Course, a Psycho Killer. What are We Missing? I Think Nothing. Except we Are Left with a Small Amount of <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> and Nudity because It Was Made for Television. Besides Being one Of The Best Sequels, it is one of The Best Thrillers to Watch as a Family. Recommended for Everyone.
1078 0 Around the late 1970's, animator <PERSON>Don Bluth</PERSON>, frustrated with the output his company, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> was churning, defected from the <ORGANIZATION>Mouse House</ORGANIZATION> to form his own studio. His first production, THE SECRET OF <ORGANIZATION>NIMH</ORGANIZATION>, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day. This was followed by AN American TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both of which were made under the involvement of <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> and were commercially successful. Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of <ORGANIZATION>NIMH</ORGANIZATION>, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups. But before long, <PERSON>Don Bluth</PERSON> had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s THE LITTLE MERMAID.<br /><br />Considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare. Instead <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder. That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children. On the other hand, it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN. In short, it's a movie with a major identity crisis.<br /><br />Set in a dreary junkyard of <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, the movie starts out when <PERSON>Charlie B. Barkin</PERSON>, a rough-and-tumble German shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigar-puffing pitbull, <ORGANIZATION>Carface</ORGANIZATION>. Before you know it, <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> finds himself in heaven, albeit by default. Here a whippet angel, <PERSON>Annabelle</PERSON>, tells him that "all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind." This line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.<br /><br />Upon realizing that he's been murdered, <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> steals his way back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and plots to get even with <ORGANIZATION>Carface</ORGANIZATION>. With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy, <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> "rescues" <ORGANIZATION>Carface</ORGANIZATION>'s prize, <PERSON>AnneMarie</PERSON>, a human girl who can talk to animals (in order to predict who will win the rat races). <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring <ORGANIZATION>Carface</ORGANIZATION> down. Although he refuses to admit it, <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> does grow to love AnneMarie...<br /><br />The concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution. Aside from the human girl <PERSON>AnneMarie</PERSON> and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes of <PERSON>Ken Page</PERSON>), none of the other characters emerge as likable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about. Unfortunately, that also applies to <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>; in trying to make him an anti-hero, the script (composed by more than ten writers) only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable. As such, the audience feels no empathy for <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing. (Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON>.) Besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story. The slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time. The aforementioned musical alligator (who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza. The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.<br /><br />Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by <PERSON>Charlie Strouse</PERSON> and <PERSON>T.J. Kuenster</PERSON> (<PERSON>AnneMarie</PERSON>'s song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from <PERSON>Ken Page</PERSON>'s mellifluous vocal) or the uneven voice cast. As mentioned, <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON>' stiff and lifeless <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end). <PERSON>Dom DeLuise</PERSON> as Itchy is pretty good, but he's had better roles, notably Tiger in AN American TAIL and <PERSON>Jeremy</PERSON> in THE SECRET OF <ORGANIZATION>NIMH</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Ken Page</PERSON>, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best. Similarly wasted are <PERSON>Loni Anderson</PERSON> (as a collie who once sired a litter with <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>), <PERSON>Melba Moore</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Charles Nelson Reilly</PERSON>. <PERSON>Judith Barsi</PERSON> as <PERSON>AnneMarie</PERSON> is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show.<br /><br /><PERSON>Barsi</PERSON> aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation. Technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON>'s team (by 1980's standards, that is), particularly a frightening scene where <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon. If anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.<br /><br />On the whole, however, I cannot recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment. Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON>'s better efforts. Animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry, but by the time it's over, ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth.
1079 1 The first was good and original. I was a not bad horror/comedy movie. So I heard a second one was made and I had to watch it.<br /><br />What really makes this movie work is <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON>'s character and the sometimes clever script. A pretty good script for a person who wrote the Final Destination films and the direction was okay. Sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look.<br /><br />Great made-for-TV movie. It was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON>'s Stanley doing what he does best.<br /><br />I suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel, just so you'll have an idea what <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> is like and get a little history background.
1080 0 ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder .<br /><br />I will be honest and confess that I wasn`t too taken by the movie since I`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but I will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features <PERSON>Miranda Richardson</PERSON> , <PERSON>Anna Friel</PERSON> , <PERSON>Richard E Grant</PERSON> , <PERSON>Michael Gough</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jason Isaacs</PERSON> . The costume design as you can expect is also excellent <br /><br />I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint <PERSON>Ives</PERSON> lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . You really do have to worry if <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing
1081 1 actually... that "video camera" effect, is just that, it's an effect, a rather good one.. (u don't know much about directing a film do you?) this film is in fact BETTER than the original, it's great fun to watch, made for TV, doesn't need to follow any rules. I find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, its disturbing. and all the time we are routing for <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON> to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side. i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it. Watching this film you can understand how real movies are made, as this is sort of like a film within a film. <PERSON>Judd</PERSON> is one of the scariest villains ever, and he's more realistic, he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors.
1082 0 I found this film to be quite an oddity. From the very get go I found it extremely hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. <PERSON>Jean-Marc Barr</PERSON>, although I love him to bits (I think <PERSON>Zentropa</PERSON> is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here, and although I can't figure for the life of me who would be better, I am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work. Everything else is fine, except for the stabs at weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) and I really like <PERSON>Richard E. Grant</PERSON> as the British Major. It just suffers from one thing.. <PERSON>Jean-Marc</PERSON>.
1083 1 as a sequel,this is not a bad movie.i actually liked it better than the 1st one.i found it more entertaining.it seemed like it was shot documentary style.at first this bothered me,as i thought it just looked too low budget.but it grew on me,and it made the movie seem more authentic.this movie has more dry one liners than the original,which is a good thing,in my opinion.i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters.it almost becomes a parody of itself,which may be the point.this movie at least has some suspense,which the 1st one did not have,in my view.it has some of the same great music from the original,which is great.the acting again was pretty decent for the most part,though like i said,some of it seemed over the top.i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow,like the rest of the movie.overall,though,i thought this was a pretty sequel.my rating for "Return to Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION>" is 7/10*
1084 0 First of all there is Gujarati Theatre then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Director <PERSON>Vipul Shah</PERSON> should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theatre when making a Bollywood production. First he made <PERSON>Aankhen</PERSON> (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot, but could not hold as a Hindi film. Now he's adapted another Gujarati play and named it Waqt - a race against time. In sum, the emotions are alien. The plot development is not for Hindi films. For example, the role play between father and son is best left to Gujarati Theatre - don't bring it in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - nothing to shout about - barring <PERSON>Shefali Chhaya Shah</PERSON> who is fantastic.
1085 1 When I first found out that <PERSON>Brian Krause</PERSON> was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to realize that I've seen the original of this and loved it. So I had even more reason to watch. Well, I watched. It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies. I hate what happens to <PERSON>Brian</PERSON>'s character (you can find out for yourself) and I didn't like most of the characters, <PERSON>Brian</PERSON>'s one included. But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make <PERSON>Stanley Caldwell</PERSON> (<PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON>) shine once more. At the end, I was cheering for <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> and his own happy ending. If you liked the original Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION> or if you like horror movies without the blood, I'd suggest you watch this.
1086 0 well well One cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast ..i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who? race against time? u mean waste against time? OK so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it Hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway!
1087 1 This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.I love how <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> just dumps the women into the lake.I have been a fan of <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON>'s work for many years, and he blew me away. Its a blend of horror, and drama ,and romance, not so much comedy. His evil, yet charming look captured me right then and there. That look in his eyes, I will never forget. There's something about him, I cant describe.
1088 0 PROS: <PERSON>Akshay Kumar</PERSON>'s performance(is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump <ORGANIZATION>AB</ORGANIZATION> in their movies together?). Some touching scenes in the 2nd half.<br /><br />CONS: The whole 1st hour(the jokes were flat to say the least). Every scene involving <PERSON>Rajpal Yadav</PERSON>. Major stupidity in <ORGANIZATION>AB</ORGANIZATION>'s decision making. Let me get this straight, he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way(that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to make <PERSON>Akshay</PERSON> finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth?? WTF? He considers <PERSON>Akshaye</PERSON> is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father is soon gonna die due to cancer, but thinks insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Easily the movie's biggest flaw.<br /><br />- <PERSON>Akshay</PERSON> becoming a stunt man. LMAO!! We're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in MBA. But when the time arrives to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stunt man. LOL!! How abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field? Or Heck, anywhere else where ur life isn't in danger? This is some incredibly dumb writing.<br /><br />- The ending. I hate this sort of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for AB's character, which I couldn't. The entire thing reminded me a little too much of <ORGANIZATION>Srk</ORGANIZATION> in KHNH(which I hate). This "please feel sorry for the guy with the illness" crap has run its course. I felt more like puking than sympathy for the OLD man. Couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd. the whole thing.<br /><br />Bottomline: Waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie. Its obvious director <PERSON>Vipul Shah</PERSON> targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense. Give 'em some decent song picturizations, fancy outfits, plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap-up crap like this.
1089 1 I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly, when <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allison</PERSON> are in the dance club and he is describing <PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON>'s last moments before she is thrown to the water, And secondly, When <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> is visiting <PERSON>Allison</PERSON> in his basement, right before they head down to the set, when she kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. I gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you wouldn't see the "live" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what went wrong??
1090 0 this is just usual Indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema, as Indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry, however it also the worst.<br /><br />how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage. take a look at <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>china</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like <LOCATION>Kisna</LOCATION>!!<br /><br />get real people, no wonder the international community in general laughs at Indian cinema.
1091 1 Sequels hardly ever live up to the original. This definitely proves true in this case. However, if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch. Although the camera work is lacking, <PERSON>Brian Krause</PERSON>'s character is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more funnier than the first and that is what I find entertaining about it. <br /><br />Don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film. Quite frankly it's a bit different. Rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> is off in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> trying to direct his dream project, Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION>. This movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON> back in action.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 6 out of 10.
1092 0 Those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from <PERSON>Akshay Kumar</PERSON>. I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION> production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good parent does...kick his son out the son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow- 1. <PERSON>Priyanka</PERSON> 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2. <PERSON>Akshay</PERSON> suddenly got the job as a stunt man, gets bitten by rabified dogs, to then just walk off. This film is an INSulT to our intelligence I really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.
1093 1 I thought it was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while. Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die, <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION>'s killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died. My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON> is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as <PERSON>Stanley Caldwell</PERSON>. Brilliant movie.
1094 0 This movie's full title is "Waqt: Race Against Time". That's a race no one can ever win, but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious "waqt" on this bakvaas. This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. It strained my credulity too far. It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline, and deserves to be mocked for it.<br /><br />It's not quite as awful as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. Stupid, pointless, with a ridiculously OTT performance by <PERSON>Amitji</PERSON>. The central "plot" is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many "family" BW films. If my father, who raised me, and who I love dearly, treated me like Big B did <PERSON>Akshay</PERSON>, I'd shoot him myself. To say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness.
1095 1 I don't know if I'm just weird, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. <br /><br />Return to <LOCATION>Cabin by the Lake</LOCATION> is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION>. In fact, I think that I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought that the cast in this movie was great, <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON> is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of <PERSON>Stanley</PERSON>'s screenplay Cabin by the <LOCATION>Lake</LOCATION>- it wasn't a completely redundant film of Stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. - If you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. However, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. I've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. :)
1096 0 I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it," she gushed. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies this deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but in comparison to all the other movies I have seen in my lifetime, this deserves no more than a 3. Any movie where I can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me. The characters are unbelievable, how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived. It is over dramatic and the songs aren't all that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic. Any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song. The stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary (we get it, <PERSON>Laxman</PERSON> isn't the sharpest tool in the shed). If a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn't meaningful, just a bit embarrassing.<br /><br />*****SPOILER*****<br /><br />Generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told. Too many plot holes to count. At first the movie was amusing and cute in the way Bollywood movies are to people who don't watch them that avidly but it just got tedious. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end.<br /><br />*****SPOILER OVER***** Perhaps it had a very little more depth than other Bollywood movies that I have seen, but not much at all. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny. I didn't shed a single tear nor did I feel like it, rather I was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending. I don't recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is kind of sad.
1097 1 This movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than <PERSON>Thunder Bay</PERSON> and Bend Of The River. This film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along. It starts out with <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> arriving in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is charged with murder. He is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> only cares about getting his cattle back. As the movie goes along it's like <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> only cares about himself just like his character in the Naked Spur. It gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. This is one of <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s better westerns.
1098 0 I cannot believe that the Indian film industry still puts out such third-rate dross as Waqt. For starters, the storyline is totally implausible Â– spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (I honestly am not joking here). In the meantime, his dad is dying of lung cancer, but keeps it a secret from the son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands.<br /><br />The acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess Â– no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world.<br /><br />To be honest, the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film. The actors, such as <ORGANIZATION>Amitabh Bachchan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Akshay Kumar</PERSON>, will still be revered as Gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
1099 1 The year is 1896.<PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON> (<PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>) doesn't like people.There's only one friend he's got and he's <PERSON>Ben Tatum</PERSON> (<PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>), an old sympathetic man.They're driving a cattle herd with them.That would be their key to richness.In <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> they run into trouble when Sheriff <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> (<PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON>) takes the cattle.Now <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> only has to get it back and drive it through the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Canadian border to Dawson.Now they have a group of other people with them, like the ladies <PERSON>Ronda Castle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Renee Vallon</PERSON> (<PERSON>Corinne Calvet</PERSON>).There the two men get into the gold business.Anthony <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>'s fourth collaboration, The Far Country (1954) is a fine western, indeed.The acting work is superb.Walter <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> makes a terrific sidekick to Stewart.Ruth Roman is brilliant and <PERSON>Corinne Calvet</PERSON>'s delightful.Jay <PERSON>C. Flippen</PERSON> is very good as <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> Marshal <PERSON>Rube</PERSON> Morris.The great <PERSON>Jack Elam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathleen Freeman</PERSON> are seen in smaller roles.It's fantastic to watch how <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> overcome's all the troubles in his way.There's just the man and his rifle.But also he's vulnerable.

1101 1 This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (<PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON>) going up to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> (<PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON>, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON> threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the <LOCATION>States</LOCATION>. The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful <PERSON>Klondike</PERSON> town of <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> being turned upside down by new residents from <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON>'s town. <PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON>, for instance, who has come with <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> and his two companions (<PERSON>Jay C. Flippen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Brennen</PERSON>, who plays <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s best friend), builds a saloon (a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. She paves the way for <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON> and his goons to come up, too. In 1953, <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> and director <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it could be considered cliche, as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end. Still, <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to those I've mentioned, the adorable French actress <PERSON>Corinne Calvet</PERSON> is very good. And I ought to single out <PERSON>Walter Brennen</PERSON>, as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man. The screenplay is very well written, and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.
1102 0 I've been going through the <ORGANIZATION>AFI</ORGANIZATION>'s list of the top 100 comedies, and I must say that this is truly one of the worst. Not just of the 90 movies on the list I've seen, but of any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, <PERSON>Dudley</PERSON> isn't. <PERSON>Liza</PERSON> almost made it worthwhile, but alas... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, <PERSON>Dudley</PERSON> laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the <ORGANIZATION>AFI</ORGANIZATION>'s top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a funnier "drunk", try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, any <ORGANIZATION>Marx Brothers</ORGANIZATION> movie will kill (especially if you're as drunk as <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>).
1103 1 The fourth of five westerns <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> did with <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON> who takes a cattle drive from <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, via <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. He hooks up in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> with his partners <PERSON>Ben Tatum</PERSON> (<PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Rube Morris</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jay C. Flippen</PERSON>) that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north.<br /><br />But first, he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative <PERSON>Ronda Castle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON>) who believes <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> could be a valuable ally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> (<PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON>) who runs the town of <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> locks <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town. He fines <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> the ownership of his cattle and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> just has to eat crow for the time being. <br /><br />In the meantime, <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> agrees to ride point for <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON> up to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rube</PERSON> can slip back into <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> and steal his cattle back. Of course Judge <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> with a rifle while <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> races the cattle over the Canadian border out of <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s reach.<br /><br />After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> men, they finally reach <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> where <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> sells his cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON> who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold. <br /><br />But then Judge <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> comes up to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> to get in on the gold action up there, and tells <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> that he was getting a little bored with <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> and wants to try his luck up in the <LOCATION>Klondike</LOCATION>, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving <PERSON>Rube</PERSON> to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> and his gang.<br /><br />They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s men because <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> made the mistake of opening his big mouth. <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> is killed and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> is severely wounded but that doesn't save Judge <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> from his just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> street pretty much takes care of that. First <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> kills two of <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s best gunman (<PERSON>Jack Elam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Wilkie</PERSON>). Then as <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON> comes out to warn <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> that <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> is trying to slip around behind him, <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> shoots her in the back and she dies right there in <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>'s arms. Then <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> kills <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken.<br /><br />This is another rip-roaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM <LOCATION>LARAMIE</LOCATION>. Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print <ORGANIZATION>TCM</ORGANIZATION> uses, is beyond me. You'll wind up missing half the glorious <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION> cinematography by <PERSON>William Daniels</PERSON>. So if you like well-written 50s westerns, then this one's an A-list keeper. <br /><br />8 out of 10
1104 0 I sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore. It felt as though I'd watched dozens of episodes already, and then it hit me.....There's nothing new here! I've heard that joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like that on friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline, ect. None of the actors are interesting here either! Some were good on other shows (not here), and others are new to a profession they should have never entered. Avoid this stinker!
1105 1 Now, admittedly, I'm no ardent student of the genre. As a matter of fact, I've tended always to shy away from Westerns because, in spite of all their critical cachet as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s primal stories (or whatever), they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either "shoot up the Injuns," "the big gunfight," or "Hey, let's form a posse!" In other words, it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention, that it left precious little room for surprise or originality. (And yes, I HAVE seen at least some of the so-called "greats", and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment - including <ORGANIZATION>Stagecoach</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Rio Bravo</LOCATION>, My <PERSON>Darling Clementine</PERSON>, and of course the infamous [but profoundly dull] <PERSON>Clint Eastwood-Sergio Leone</PERSON> teamups in the '60s.)<br /><br />But when I saw this movie on TV - as part of a commemorative <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> weekend upon his death - I finally GOT IT: I understood, at least in theory, what the Western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation (aside from just action and thrills). It is the push-pull between lawlessness and order; the American West represented freedom, but also the prospect of the wild, the untamed. Respectable folk could get hurt out there. Which, of course, meant that perhaps - just perhaps - it wasn't meant for respectable folk, and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty, those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers, and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land. In such an environment, of course, the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free-spirited enough to be out there in the first place (and so reject "society," at least as it manifested itself on the Eastern seaboard), and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just IS NOT RIGHT. Catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder IN THE MAIN CHARACTER HIMSELF is, I believe (after seeing this movie), the highest and truest goal of any Western. Sadly, it is so often not the case, as the white hats are completely white, the black ones completely black (and let's not even get started talking about the Indians, ok) and there is precious little shades of gray in between.<br /><br />Not in this one. <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the Alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold. He is joined in this by his lifelong buddy, played by <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> (perhaps the Western clichÃ© character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here, as always) - and no one else. Pointedly, they are out for themselves, and while <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> displays his patented charm (come on, we could never really dislike the guy, now could we?), we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self-centered, self-interested character: none of his "Gosh" or "Oh golly gee" humanism is allowed to come through. Or, rather, it has to be EARNED, by the end of the picture, in the way I described above. He must confront the lawlessness in himself, and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners' starting point on their gold dust trail. This town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff, Mr. <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON> in one of the best "bad guy" performances I've ever seen. He comes on with so much charm and humor, and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he *is* the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in, it does so with double force. Further, by establishing a type of breezy (if necessarily guarded) camaraderie between <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are - and so how far a moral distance <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> must walk by the end of the film.<br /><br />I won't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes - see those for yourself (as well as the rugged and gorgeous Alaskan scenery - filmed on location, mind you, not cheap painted stills that the studio made up). What's key here is how much this story focuses upon character, with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time - although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static (read: "talky"). Definitely one of the greatest performances I've seen from <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, showing he could play the renegade, the "man's man" just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door. If anything, in fact, his "everyman" qualities lend greater strength to his characterization, making him seem less mythic or overblown - -like, say, <PERSON>Eastwood</PERSON> or <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> - and more a three-dimensional personage. His relationship with <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> is well-played: understated, but nevertheless touching (with a faint suggestion of <PERSON>George</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lenny</PERSON> from "Of Mice and Men" - an altogether different type of "western").<br /><br />I certainly have more Westerns to see, but this is for now my favorite, and the yardstick by which I will necessarily judge all the others. It deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is.
1106 0 After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captain <PERSON>Janeway</PERSON> has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, "journey is more important than the destination". Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.<br /><br />Worst ending ever.
1107 1 After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman, a trail boss winds up in the <LOCATION>Yukon</LOCATION> gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states. While there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling. Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.
1108 0 This film is awful. The screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. <PERSON>Greg Morrisey</PERSON>'s brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON>'s performance as <PERSON>Catherine Tramell</PERSON>, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be made would be if <PERSON>Michael Douglas</PERSON> agrees to join the cast.
1109 1 (contains slight spoilers)<br /><br />It's interesting how <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> uses <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> here. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is, of course, remembered by many as <PERSON>George Bailey</PERSON> from <PERSON>Frank Capra</PERSON>'s "It's a Wonderful Life", so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life", <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born. In "The Far Country", <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON>, by not getting involved to help anyone else (except himself), gets to see essentially the same thing: A world in which he (for all practical matters) doesn't exist.<br /><br />By not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing. This reminds the viewer of <PERSON>George Bailey</PERSON> watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born. <br /><br />Both movies end with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it would seem, earned his "wings".
1110 0 The film is pretty confusing and ludicrous. The plot is awful...but on the plus side the acting is pretty good, with a few good shouts and rants. <PERSON>Sharon</PERSON> stone is OK this time...not even half as good as the original mind you. The murders aren't as gory as the first one either, which is a shame. Its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though. The sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with banter and arguments between Dr.Glass and <PERSON>Washburn</PERSON> are highlights. The plot twists a few times, but the ending is awful. The tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'Oh my god!'. The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise, rush-felt film. <PERSON>Sharon</PERSON> stone is a bit old for this too. The bits where we see her breasts were, in the first one, delights. This time around, they are too horrid to describe. The films its self is rather average, but it is worth a go. Mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz...with the opening sequence being a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. Don't ruin the run. You'll be glad you left this stone unturned.
1111 1 My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I couldn't find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in Feb., 1955. I saw it in a "first run" theater in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> in March, 1958. Wonder if it was re-released, or some problem? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. <PERSON>John McIntyre</PERSON> does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief. <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> does basically the same role he did in <LOCATION>Red River</LOCATION> years earlier. And, in my opinion, <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> gives as fine a performance as he ever did. I have seen this movie a half dozen times or more, and never tire of seeing parts of it again. The photography and scenery are splendid, and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
1112 0 In my book "Basic Instinct" was a perfect film. It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get!<br /><br />This sequel is the exact opposite, it cannot possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument. The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the <PERSON>Jerry Goldsmith</PERSON> score of BI1. <PERSON>Michael Caton-Jones</PERSON> and the half-wit responsible for the script even included the "There is no smoking in this room" dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney (who is now a solicitor) away! <br /><br />I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body applies to film-making, too. There should be a law: Don't ever make a sequel to a perfect film!
1113 1 Cowboys <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> take their herd from <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and on into <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to stake a claim. Once there, they have to contend with seductive, shifty businesswoman <PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON> and ice-cold, happy-go-lucky villain <PERSON>James McIntire</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> may get talked about more, but his good pal <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> made some excellent, hard-edged westerns too, some with the great director <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON>. Frankly, I'd take this, with it's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama, over North To <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> any day!<br /><br />The Far Country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen.<br /><br />Also, there's some strong support by the always reliable <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> (who's great), the incredibly cute <PERSON>Corrine Calvet</PERSON>, and <PERSON>James McIntire</PERSON>, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously.<br /><br />This would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended Mann/Stewart northwest-set western, Bend Of The River.
1114 0 It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage. The original was a high impact, dark thriller that achieved "cult" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>. This film adds nothing, delivers nothing, and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.<br /><br />The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast. Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of <PERSON>Catherine Tramell</PERSON>... or is it <ORGANIZATION>Sharon Stone</ORGANIZATION>. Possibly a copulation of both.<br /><br />If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in "B.S.1", forget it. You wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them. It's interesting to note that the wonderful <PERSON>Charlotte Rampling</PERSON> was romping around in her skivvies, via the 1966 <PERSON>GEORGY GIRL</PERSON>, when Ms. <PERSON>Stone</PERSON> was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.<br /><br />If you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you might as well wait for the DVD release in the "rated" version, "unrated" version, "collectors" edition, or "ultimate" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of "Basic Instinct 3" at which point Ms. <PERSON>Stone</PERSON> will be 62 years old and nobody will really care.
1115 1 As I drove from <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Dawson City</LOCATION>,<PERSON>Yukon</PERSON> a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery, I cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location. <PERSON>Jasper</PERSON> in the Canadian <LOCATION>Rockies</LOCATION> is a magnificent place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>, that is when I feel <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON>, who used the outdoor locations so well, could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place. <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. <PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON> is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, <PERSON>Corinne Calvet</PERSON> is the nice girl. <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes. He uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the browns in "The Man From Laramie". Like all of the Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s character which is more complex.
1116 0 It's been about 14 years since <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> awarded viewers a leg-crossing that twisted many people's minds. And now, God knows why, she's in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica "Basic Instinct" featuring a sexy Stone and a vulnerable <PERSON>Michael Douglas</PERSON>. However, fans of the original might not even get close to this one, since "Instinct 2" is painful film-making, as the mediocre director <PERSON>Michael Caton-Jones</PERSON> assassinates the legacy of the first film.<br /><br />The plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning. <PERSON>Catherine Tramell</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON>, trying to look forcefully sexy) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible <PERSON>David Morrisey</PERSON>) is appointed to examine her, but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction.<br /><br />And there it is, without no further explanations, the basic force that moves this "Instinct". Nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy, C-class erotic film. <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn-off. Part of it because of the amateurish writing, the careless direction, and terrifyingly low chemistry. The movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldn't be rated NC-17) than the first entrance in the series. "Instinct" is a compelling torture.<br /><br />To top it off, everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film. The acting here is really bad. <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> has some highlights, but here, she gets extremely obnoxious. <PERSON>David Morrisey</PERSON> stars in the worst role of his life, and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie- confused and aroused. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series, that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well. <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>, how I miss you....<br /><br />"Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and, indeed, it isn't. Some films should never get out of paper, and that is the feeling you get after watching this. Now, it is much easier to understand why <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Cronenberg</PERSON> dropped out, and why <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> was expecting a huge paycheck for this......-----3/10
1117 1 Classic drama/action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it's time(1954). The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love.Unique peek into the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining.This movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "lawmen" during this particular time and place were very crooked/corrupt much like most developing countries today.The action sequences could have been more realistic though but still,this movie really covers most of the essentials.Not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy.......
1118 0 I saw this film at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Premiere, and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining.<br /><br />The original "Basic Instinct" was no great film and is still something of a "smut classic" but it was entertaining. I can recall countless times flipping through channels on TV on a late Friday or Saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it.<br /><br />However, this lame-brain, waaay-belated sequel has nothing. Is <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> still gorgeous? Well, let's put it this way -- for a 47-year-old, she's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing. She doesn't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original -- which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress, and whatnot.<br /><br />The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible -- and <PERSON>Michael Caton-Jones</PERSON> (a typically safe director -- one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies) has officially delivered his first true turkey; a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious.<br /><br />I hear the film went through multiple editing sessions, and it's very clear from the start. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending -- oh my! Talk about stupid AND unbelievable. (Still predictable, though.) I saw "<PERSON>Gigli</PERSON>," I saw "Son of the Mask" -- and although I'm not looking to "smear" this film, I can say with my own authority (which you don't have to agree with at all, mind you) that I prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure.<br /><br />By the way, <PERSON>Stone</PERSON> left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub.<br /><br />"Basic Instinct 2" -- basically, it stinks, too.
1119 1 A good film with--for its time--an intense, sprawling, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON>'s "The Searchers" though not so brutal. The story starts fast and doesn't let up, with several scenes of really good dialog between (<PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s) <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ronda Castle</PERSON> and Sheriff <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>. This film is in some ways reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a Mann-Stewart work, but I found it far less sentimental and more interesting. There are a few caveats: a too-quickly wrapped up (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old <PERSON>Corrine Calvert</PERSON> is not very convincing as a naive French teenager, and of course the film takes place in the <LOCATION>Mythic West</LOCATION>, a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply. But these are trivial concerns. <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beat. A fine Western costume drama.
1120 0 It's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON>'s original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy, well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria, a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let's state the obvious for starters - <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> is too old for the part of sexual magnet <PERSON>Catherine Trammell</PERSON>. What was so photogenic thru <PERSON>Verhoeven</PERSON>'s lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire <PERSON>Michael Caton-Jones</PERSON>, who's flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON> a lot, but if the first film launched her career, BI2 could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt <PERSON>David Morrissey</PERSON> - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange-skin machismo of <PERSON>Michael Douglas</PERSON>. Supporting turns by <PERSON>David Thewlis</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clichÃ©-heavy posturing. And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? Poorly-lit, fleetingly-glimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel, Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2. As a vanity project, it rivals <LOCATION>Battlefield Earth</LOCATION> in its misconception. As a multi-million dollar piece of <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> film-making, it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.
1121 1 Another very good <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> flick thanks to the father/son combination of <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON>. <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ben Tatum</PERSON>) is often the comedic conscience of either <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> or <PERSON>Wayne</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Red River</LOCATION>/ <LOCATION>Rio Bravo</LOCATION>). He's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend. "You're wrong Mr. <PERSON>Dunston</PERSON>". <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON>(<PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON>. <PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON> is excellent as the law of <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it. Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people. The loner can do neither and suffers for it.<br /><br />The caption above plays on <PERSON>Tatum</PERSON>'s assertion that he can't live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction proves fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen.<br /><br />I recommend this film and now own the DVD.
1122 0 Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so, with an exception of <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON>, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want to *beep* you " and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON> and it shows. The new composer is no <PERSON>Jerry Goldsmith</PERSON> and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for <PERSON>Joe Eszterhas</PERSON>. There's no substitute for <PERSON>Michael Douglas</PERSON> in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" All to all the original movie is like Citizen <PERSON>Kane</PERSON> compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking, sexy and controversial. It had the best <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON>'s performance in her career. It had this specific <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>'s style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories. It's a pity that they made this film.
1123 1 <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON>'s westerns with <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> are slowly gaining for that director a position with <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Howard Hawks</ORGANIZATION> as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> - in <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s films there is an edge to <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a "I trust only myself" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON>) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). <br /><br />He meets his match in <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>'s boss is a so-called law man named <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> (<PERSON>John McIntyre</PERSON>) who reminds one of the real boss of <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> in the "Gold Rush" <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> "Soapy" <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and Judge <PERSON>Roy Bean</PERSON>. The problem is that neither <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s profit). <br /><br /><PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is partner with <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> (<PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> - who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge <PERSON>Roy Bean</PERSON>). They are also joined by <PERSON>Rube Morris</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jay C. Flippen</PERSON>) and also meet two women, the sophisticated <PERSON>Rhonda Castle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON>) and the friendly and helpful <PERSON>Renee Vallon</PERSON> (<PERSON>Corinne Calvert</PERSON>). <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON> works closely with <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>, but had helped <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> earlier in fleeing the authorities in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. However, she has a similar "I only trust myself" attitude to <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. He, <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Rube</PERSON> go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. <PERSON>Renee</PERSON> follows and warns them that <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> and his associates are following. <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> holds off <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border, although <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> points out that since <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> has to return by way of <PERSON>Skagway Gannon</PERSON> can wait until he does to hang him.<br /><br />The reunited party of <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> split over the trail to take to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> opting for a longer and safer route. After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. The herd is sold to <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rube</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Renee</PERSON> start prospecting. There is soon two groups in the town of <LOCATION>Dawson</LOCATION>. One led by <PERSON>Connie Gilchrist</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chubby Johnson</PERSON> want to build a decent town. But the <ORGANIZATION>Mounties</ORGANIZATION> won't be setting up a station in <LOCATION>Dawson</LOCATION> for months. The other, centering around the "dancehall" run by <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON>, are in cahoots with <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (<PERSON>Robert J. Wilke</PERSON> - really scary in one sequence with <PERSON>Chubby Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jay C. Flippen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack Elam</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Harry Morgan</PERSON>). <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> for a ranch they want in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. But will they get there? And will <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> remain neutral?<br /><br />The performances are dandy here, including <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. <PERSON>Flippen</PERSON> is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> in the heart using <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s own words against him. <PERSON>McIntyre</PERSON> would achieve stardom on television in WAGON TRAIN replacing <PERSON>Ward Bond</PERSON>, but his work in <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in WINCHESTER '73). He is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. Roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. And <PERSON>Calvert</PERSON> is both a voice of conscience and a frontier "<PERSON>Gigi</PERSON>" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.<br /><br />Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.
1124 0 I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one. **MILD SPOILERS** Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? The poor of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> coming out to sing? <PERSON>Fagin</PERSON> and Dodger walking off into the sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was publicly hanged and <PERSON>Fagin</PERSON> went crazy in prison. **END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br /><PERSON>Oliver Reed</PERSON> is very weak as <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON>, doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. Worst however, is <PERSON>Mark Lester</PERSON> as <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON>, who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character. His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl. Guess they didn't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.<br /><br />Self-respecting <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> fans: stick to <PERSON>David Lean</PERSON>'s amazing 1948 film or the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80's. Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical.
1125 1 This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON>(<PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Ronda Castle</PERSON>(<PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON>). She takes an instant liking to <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. Gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON> clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>. She eventually has to decide between <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON>Rene</PERSON>, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. Yet, she sticks with him in his travels from <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> and his activities around <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. Along with <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON>, she nurses him back to health after <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> is left for dead by <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s gunslingers at his gold claim. <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>, serves as <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>'s long time sidekick. He doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>'s hard edges. His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON>(as Sheriff <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. Evidently, he sees something of himself in <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him. He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous <PERSON>Soapy Smith</PERSON>, who spent his last years in <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>, as one of the premier con men of his times.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>), who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. In this respect, he closely resemble's <PERSON>Burt Lancaster</PERSON>'s character in "Vera Cruz", for example. Thus, <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> not only turns down the job of marshall of <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>, he is convinced to leave <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> after <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. Even <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON> suggests that she and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> make a hurried exit from <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> while they are still alive. Then, <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> and himself. He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s gang from <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>. In this respect, he differs from <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>'s character, who never reforms(But is <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)<br /><br />The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women. Clearly, <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON> is groomed as the right woman to tame <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>. Although she is clearly characterized as a "bad" girl, <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Yukon</LOCATION>, and having stolen his cattle back from <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>. Ironically, soon after <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> changes from anti-hero to hero, <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON> makes a similar change in running into the street to warn <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> of <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s impending ambush. She dies as a result and <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).<br /><br />It's clear that <PERSON>Corine Calvert</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Renee</PERSON>, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON>, in <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>'s mind. Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in <PERSON>Rhonda</PERSON>'s saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. I'm also very unclear about her relationship with <PERSON>Rube Morris</PERSON>, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(He's not her father).<br /><br />Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s gang. If <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> under that boardwalk, before <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> did the same to him. And how did <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>'s badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. And why weren't most of <PERSON>Ronda</PERSON>'s pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?<br /><br />You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s gang. The sequences shot in the Canadian <LOCATION>Rockies</LOCATION> provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. All-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. No doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the <LOCATION>US Skagway</LOCATION>.
1126 0 Must every good story be "improved" with added corny Broadway music? Apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering. I confess that <PERSON>Oliver Twist</PERSON> and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out, and this was a great example of just that... So of course, take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Fetch me a basin.<br /><br />The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of, but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of <PERSON>Oliver Reed</PERSON> (pardon if I'm mistaken, it's been a while).<br /><br />My biggest complaint I've stated. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? Seldom has this been done to good effect. Generally it ruins the story. It did with this one. Jury's still out on whether this story is worth saving, but with all that gadding about, it's impossible to tell.
1127 1 The penultimate collaboration between director <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> and star <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> (excluding the few days <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> worked on Night Passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), The Far Country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way. This time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by <PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON>'s larcenous judge of the <ORGANIZATION>Roy Bean</ORGANIZATION> school of law and order. Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims...<br /><br />While it's no great surprise which way <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem. For most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON>, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him. In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature, there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is.<br /><br />As usual with <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> there's an exceptional use of high country locations, though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground, and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harry Morgan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON> (though <PERSON>Corinne Calvert</PERSON>'s young romantic interest veers to the irritating). Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian <LOCATION>Rockies</LOCATION> is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.
1128 0 The producers made a big mistake casting <PERSON>Mark Lester</PERSON>, who couldn't act or sing, in the title role. Aside from his very bad "acting", all of <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>'s singing had to be dubbed by a girl. I don't know why they cast him at all, since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well. <PERSON>Shani Wallis</PERSON> was far too old to play <PERSON>Nancy</PERSON>, who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. <PERSON>Ross McCormack</PERSON> is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than <PERSON>Jack Wild</PERSON> ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.
1129 1 Colorful western.<br /><br /><LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> cowboy <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> moseys on up to the Yukon Territory to dig for gold, sell his steers, and try to get a date with pretty saloon-owner <PERSON>Ruth Roman</PERSON> if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff <PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON> who wants <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s cattle. Beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by <PERSON>William Fritzsche</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Daniels</PERSON>. Good Technicolor adventure from <ORGANIZATION>Universal-International</ORGANIZATION>, directed by <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON>.<br /><br />Also starring <PERSON>Corinne Calvet</PERSON>, <PERSON>Connie Gilchrist</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON> as <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>'s sidekick.
1130 0 The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver." Instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings, they merely wrote Broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.<br /><br />Too, the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score. It's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.<br /><br />The casting of the boy <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON> doesn't help matters: tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there's something less than solid here. <PERSON>Fagin</PERSON> performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.<br /><br />"As Long As He Needs Me" is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. The two big production numbers, "Who Will Buy" and "Consider Yourself" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess. <br /><br />The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess I have trouble with Mr. <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /><br />Not all the combined talent of this production, either on- or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material. All this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me.<br /><br />
1131 1 This first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON> to the screen. "The Far Country" is the only one out of all five Stewart-Mann westerns that is often overlooked. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, yet again, puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five Stewart-Mann westerns. <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON> (<PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>) is uncaring, always looking out for himself, which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. Ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. This displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick, <PERSON>Ben Tatum</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>, since <PERSON>Tatum</PERSON> is the one that gave it to him. <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>, yet again, puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five Stewart-Mann westerns. He displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. The story is that <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>, through a series of events, wind up in the get rich quick town of <LOCATION>Dawson</LOCATION>, along with gold partners <PERSON>Calvet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Flippen</PERSON>, and no-good but beautiful Roman and her hired men. They are unable to leave, because crooked sheriff Mr. <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> (<PERSON>McIntire</PERSON>) and his "deputies" will hang them, since the only way out is through <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>, which is <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s town. But, eventually, <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON> comes to them, but not to collect <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. What is <PERSON>McIntire</PERSON> there for? He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. People are killed. A sheriff for <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> is considered needed, and <PERSON>Calvet</PERSON> elects <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> because he is good with a gun. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out. He also refuses it because he does not like to help people, since law and order always gets somebody killed. So, <PERSON>Flippen</PERSON> is elected instead. A miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s men, a purely evil, mustachioed fancy gunman named <PERSON>Madden</PERSON>, who carries two guns, played by <PERSON>Wilke</PERSON>. <PERSON>Flippen</PERSON> attempts to arrest <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk. A man named <PERSON>Yukon</PERSON> replaces <PERSON>Flippen</PERSON>. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tatum</PERSON> start to pull out, but are ambushed by <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>'s men. <PERSON>Tatum</PERSON> is killed, and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is wounded. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> finally realizes that he must do something, or <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> will take over <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>, set up his own rules, and it will become his town, just like <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION>. The audience also realizes what <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> must do. Another thing that the audience realizes is that <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON>. If <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> leaves, <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> would take over the town. If <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. This is where a great scene occurs. <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> walks into his cabin. He has a sling on his arm. For a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is in the background, just inside the door. He stares at it for a few seconds. He tosses the sling away. The sling lands on the back of a chair, and falls to the floor. This is symbolic, because he is throwing away his old life, which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. He comes into his new life, of helping people when they need help. What ends the film is a guns-blazing, furious show of good against evil, and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright.
1132 0 This movie was very very mediocre and very very gory. everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act I mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot. not at all scary!
1133 1 Cunningly interesting Western from a director who had few peers in the genre. Much like other <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> pictures, The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery. Both of which play out amongst some of <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death! The story sees fortune hunting partners <PERSON>Jeff Webster</PERSON> {<PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>} and <PERSON>Ben Tatum</PERSON> {<PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>} travel to <ORGANIZATION>Oregon Territory</ORGANIZATION> with a herd of cattle. Aware of the blossoming gold-boom, they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town. Arriving in <LOCATION>Skagway</LOCATION> they find self-appointed judge Mr. <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> {<PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON>} ready to meet out justice to <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> on account of <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> having fractured the law, all be it with honest cause, along the way. In punishment <PERSON>Gannon</PERSON> takes the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and head across the Canadian border to <PERSON>Dawson-with Gannon</PERSON> and his men in hot pursuit. Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.<br /><br />Interesting from start to finish, The Far Country benefits greatly from <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>'s bubbling {anti} hero in waiting portrayal and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>'s slick direction of the tight <LOCATION>Borden Chase</LOCATION> script. The cinematography from <PERSON>William H. Daniels</PERSON> is superlative, tho not done any favours by current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and a "will he wont he?" core reeling the viewers in. Paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans, it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful, yet dark, Western world of <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Stewart</PERSON>. 8/10
1134 0 This movie is one of the most awful movies ever made.How can <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> play in a movie? He is a singer not an actor, What?Is he killing vampires with his guitar? And what about the dreadful plot? O my God this movie really sucks. In the end is the Queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire <PERSON>Arly Jover</PERSON> (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left!! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires? They run out in the sun??? And what about the "Grand Finally" when <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> blows her head with a shotgun??? That's really a "NOT" . In "Buffy the vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN??? This really is a lack of originality!
1135 1 <PERSON>Jimmy Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anthony Mann</PERSON> teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best.<br /><br />The real star of the film however is the spectacular Canadian <LOCATION>Rockies</LOCATION> that serve as a backdrop for the story. Some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film.<br /><br />In all five of the westerns that <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast. No exception here, right down to parts that might only have a few lines, the characters are firmly etched with those lines.<br /><br /><PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> is a cynical hard-bitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>. It's <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON>'s death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process.<br /><br /><PERSON>John McIntire</PERSON> is the head villain of the piece and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range. He could play delightful old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain. <br /><br />One of the best westerns ever.
1136 0 This "Debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am speechless" I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes, Now I am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make fun of this movie" but this movie is giving me nothing to work with. I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but I am going to anyway "This movie sucks" There I said it! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine year old niece could make a better film. The only decent thing about this film is the sound and/or sound track. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old tool box. I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just tape over this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead. I could wash with soap but I fear I will never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike

1138 0 Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, <PERSON>John Carpenter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tommy Lee Wallace</PERSON>. This movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget retread makes me yawn.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> (the poor man's <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON>) drives around <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear <PERSON>ala Antonio Banderas</PERSON>'s guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up some lame "hunters" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire), and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest (to walk in the sunlight by stealing the <ORGANIZATION>Black Cross</ORGANIZATION> and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this, and done much better.<br /><br /><PERSON>John Carpenter</PERSON> has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic. The only decent film he's done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap, right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM <LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> and THE THING?<br /><br /><PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON> crony <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON> proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper-thin script packed with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention I hated every character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film. How does that happen? This film has nothing to recommend it. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful.<br /><br />By comparison, <PERSON>JASON X</PERSON>: "FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. Now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.
1139 1 A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, (<PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON>) whose Reverend father (<PERSON>Tom Skerritt</PERSON>) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and his sons, there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching movie narrated by the director, <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON>, playing the elderly <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead.<br /><br />Certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws.<br /><br />The closing lines sum up the "point" of the movie: "Then in the <LOCATION>Arctic</LOCATION> half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the <LOCATION>Big Blackfoot River</LOCATION> and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters."
1140 0 <PERSON>John Carpenter</PERSON>'s career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication. His excuse is that he only produced it. <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> looks like a girl. In fact, <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> and the two Vampire girls, <PERSON>Natasha Wagner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arly Jover</PERSON> probably all fit in the same clothes. In short, it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way. <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> has the most charisma. At least he looks happy when he is smiling. The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints. At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss, but stop. Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires. At one point, <PERSON>Arly Jover</PERSON> is providing fellatio to a very dumb <PERSON>Vampire Hunter</PERSON> and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act. It would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof, and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched <PERSON>Arly Jover</PERSON> move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening. As far as gore is concerned, a few heads are ripped off, and the blood spurts profusely. These scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny, and there is no "horror" pay-off from the scene. All you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of "Wow, that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls. I wonder who has to clean it up." Throughout the movie, these <ORGANIZATION>Vampire Hunters</ORGANIZATION> who are obviously trying to kill <PERSON>Arly Jover</PERSON> (the top vampire in the world??) keep reaching out to her. At one point, <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow (and has done so on other occasions), he says "I am not trying to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. I want to get to know you." HUH?? Of course, the dumb vampire Arly jumps out to say hello and <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> sticks her again with another impaling device. "Why Can't We Be Friends" the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie. Aside from all of the other silly moments, there is a transfusion sequence when <PERSON>Natasha Wagner</PERSON> has all her Vampire blood removed, and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion. I guess Blood Type is not important? Anyhow, all her Vampire blood is removed. <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> then decides that if that blood is transfused into him, he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also. Of course, as the vampire blood is transfused into him, none of his healthy blood is removed. So apparently <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body. And just like the first VAMPIRES, this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect.
1141 1 Embarrassingly, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that any father or brother can relate to... one brother is a bit 'wild,' the other brother is the typical older child. <PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON> is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> is amazing, and <PERSON>Skerritt</PERSON> is perfectly cast as the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> are absolutely breathtaking... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The movie closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. Unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.
1142 0 I only rented this because i loved the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: <LOCATION>Los Muertos</LOCATION> is just a con trick to get you to rent it. He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)<br /><br />A tragic storyline, terrible special effects and <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time. It's not even comically bad.<br /><br />What we end up with is a dull, uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichÃ©d acting. It just reeks of low budget.<br /><br />Avoid like the Bubonic plague.
1143 1 In watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie. I have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my Bible. After watching the movie I agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice. I strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> to fish or be outdoors to do so. It is amazing. I can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>. Do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era. STRONGLY Recommend And as a guide for fishing trips in both <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes. Thank you for listening Watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie.
1144 0 Ugh, what can I say other than, ugh. I rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original Vampires. This movie could not have been any lamer. Lacking not only in plot, but the acting is atrocious. Combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch. Many times I questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark. Here's a sampling of the lamer aspects...<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Professional "Slayer" insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night. He wakes up to a woman crying, sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere. He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious results...<br /><br />One of the main characters is <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON>, was bitten by a Vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, she's fine, although her body temperature is below room temperature...<br /><br />Guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires, hero leaves the next day. He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left...<br /><br />...avoid this movie.
1145 1 In answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of <PERSON>Jess</PERSON>'s brother here is my response:<br /><br />The role of <PERSON>Jess</PERSON>'s brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. <PERSON>Craig Sheffer/Norman</PERSON> could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how <PERSON>Jess</PERSON>'s brother turned out. There are various instances where <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> and his lives run in parallel, for example, when <PERSON>Jess</PERSON>'s brother takes <PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON> to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there so <PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON>'s character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.
1146 0 The last reviewer was very generous. I quiet like the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this one very much. The beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill pretty quickly. I just don't see <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> as a "bad-ass vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. A lot of the scenes just do not make sense. I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why Una is able to communicate with <PERSON>Jovi</PERSON>? Nothing was ever explain in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but that was too much to ask. This has to be one of worst vampire movie I have seen.
1147 1 I've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this film (and <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>'s novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip.<br /><br /><PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> brings a lot to the film. His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, <PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> work surprising well as brothers. I don't know quite how to describe <PERSON>Tom Skerritt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brenda Blethyn</PERSON>'s performances, except that they truly feel real. "A River Runs Through It" is a wonderful film.<br /><br />8.6 out of 10
1148 0 This movie was messed up. A sequel to "<PERSON>John Carpenter</PERSON>'s Vampires", this didn't add up right. I'm not sure that I enjoyed this much. It was a little strange. Stick to the first "Vampires", it's a good movie. "Vampires: Los Muetos" wasn't a good attempt of a sequel.<br /><br />4/10
1149 1 Academy Award winner <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> (Best Director. Ordinary People 1980) captures the majesty of the <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> wilderness and the strength of the American family in this acclaimed adaptation of Norman Macleans classic memoir.<br /><br /><PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON> stars as the young <PERSON>Norman</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> stars as his brother <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world.<br /><br />Growing up, both boys rebel against their stern Minister father (<PERSON>Tom Skerritt</PERSON>).<br /><br />While <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> channels his rebellion into writing, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> descends a slippery path to self-destruction.<br /><br />Also starring <PERSON>Emily LLoyd</PERSON> as wild-hearted <PERSON>Jessie Burns</PERSON>.<br /><br />The film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematopghaphy in 1993.
1150 0 This movie isn't very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. The plot just trods along with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
1151 1 Great drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON>'s character interviewing the President,or <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> getting murdered instead of just having it described to us.Scenes like those would have kept the audience awake.Cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those.The dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> here makes the film so worth watching.Also,big fans of fising,early 20th century styles and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> will really like this as well........
1152 0 Hi folks<br /><br />Forget about that movie. <PERSON>John C.</PERSON> should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke.<br /><br />The first vampires was good ... and it was the only vampires. This thing here just wears the same name.<br /><br />Just a waste of time thinks ...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
1153 1 this film was just brilliant,casting,location scenery,story,direction,everyone's really suited the part they played,and you could just imagine being there,<PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON>'s is an amazing actor and now the same being director,<PERSON>Norman</PERSON>'s father came from the same Scottish island as myself,so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film,the witty remarks throughout the film were great,it was just brilliant,so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch,and the fly-fishing was amazing,really cried at the end it was so sad,and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good,and this definitely was, also congratulations to the two little boy's that played the part's of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> they were just brilliant,children are often left out of the praising list i think, because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film,but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done, don't you think? the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us all.
1154 0 First of all, <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> doesn't seem to be in place in a vampire movie. Together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable. If you keep that in mind and you're a total vampire movie fan, you can have some fun with a few of the scenes. Don't expect any Tarantino-style chapters here and neither an <PERSON>Anne Rice</PERSON> storyline. (I expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow ;)
1155 1 This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The Footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. It also received an Oscar for best photography, and deservedly so. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I've seen besides them, and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one.<br /><br />It's unique and an overall great movie. The cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters. We follow their destinies with devotion, and get very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think much of this film for what it represent, and how it present it. I warmly recommend it
1156 0 This is not a good film. The acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing.The film doesn't seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route. I never saw the first film but this one doesn't stand up on its own merits, there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire. Not worth the effort of watching
1157 1 There is not much more I can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one, except - as <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> says - "it's the berries". All of page one's commentators wrote eloquently - as almost so as the dialog is in this movie. This just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about, but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines: a beautiful script. Maybe <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie, so that the beauty of the story would not get lost.<br /><br />I, too, attended church when I was very young and into my late teens. The church's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the Rev. <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> did in his church. That, in itself, is a totally different picture that is portrayed of Southern Baptist churches - no holy-rollering in my church. It was a big church, with many different programs to keep its congregation busy - the most inspiring perhaps was the music-department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems. Too, the Sunday evening-congregation was almost entirely younger people. Are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on Sunday night? How I wish it still was ! Watching "A River Runs through It" is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life. As has already been so beautifully written, the sermon for this movie is the open-space beauties of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> - yet, aren't there also missile-silos there, too? Fly-fishing or any other activity which draws family-members closer together for a happy life - and deep understanding of one another - becomes a blessing. Although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then, too, the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart, if you let it. Speakeasies and prostitutes are counter-balanced by the simple gatherings of old-fashioned, community picnics as this movie contains - in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to <ORGANIZATION>Disney Land</ORGANIZATION> for screeching joyrides and calling it "a day together". There is noting wrong with that, but as "River" demonstrates, some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer. This is the third film I've seen in which <PERSON>Tom Skeritt</PERSON> (?) plays a father, all different styles and brilliantly acted.<br /><br /><PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>, mostly an undiscovered talent except for "<PERSON>Thelma</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louise</PERSON>" and "Meet Joe Black", and all of the cast-members deserved many awards. Little stories superbly told will get 10-of-10 from me over any movie with violence, foul language, ugliness and "action". I am thinking particularly of "Crash" and most of "Arnold's" movies. What a savior for peace this movie is.
1158 0 Listening to the director's commentary confirmed what I had suspected whilst watching the film: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that "I could write a book/screenplay/award winning sitcom" phase. There's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because its a sequel to some-one else's movie), but it is totally buried under an underwritten, badly executed and laughably un-thought-out script.<br /><br />The lines are dire, and the performances are un-engaging, though again, I'm inclined to blame the director. He does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required, rather plonked the script in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these actors could have acquitted themselves better (say what you like about musicians in movies, <PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON> was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man).<br /><br />As it stands, the cast have no chemistry whatsoever. A beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when, in order to infect <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON>'s character with vampire blood from his ailing co-hunter, he is given a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leads, is by the directors own admittance accidental. He had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition - so, I suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse. But not a lot.<br /><br />Frankly, as movies go, this is badly plotted, silly and forgettable. Even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and bloody little romp, but the director has left with more of a comedy, for all the wrong reasons.
1159 1 In my humble opinion, this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved. <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> lives near me here in <LOCATION>Provo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and this was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together. The movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart, and I was weepy for several days after seeing the movie. Sometimes love isn't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- I was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>, "But when I am alone in the half light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul, and memories. And the sounds of the <LOCATION>Big Black Foot River</LOCATION>, and a four count rhythm, and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters." These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie (by <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> who is narrating as <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>), are basically scripture, in my opinion. Any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography. It was beautiful!
1160 0 Really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement.<br /><br />This vampire's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far, <PERSON>Derek Bliss</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON>), travels to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> in search for some blood suckers!, he use some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of some <PERSON>Van Helsig</PERSON> vampire's hunters net?, OK, but he work alone. He's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight (is almost a sequel of Vampires (1998) directed by <PERSON>John Carpenter</PERSON> and starred by <PERSON>James Woods</PERSON>), <PERSON>Derek</PERSON> start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: <PERSON>Sancho</PERSON> (<PERSON>Diego Luna</PERSON>, really bad acting also) a teenager without experience, Father <PERSON>Rodrigo</PERSON> (<PERSON>Cristian De la Fuente</PERSON>) a catholic priest, <PERSON>Zoey</PERSON> (<PERSON>Natasha Wagner</PERSON>) a particular vampire and <PERSON>Ray Collins</PERSON> (<PERSON>Darius McCrary</PERSON>) another expert vampire hunter. So obviously in this adventure he isn't alone.<br /><br />You can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor (<PERSON>Jon Bon Jovi</PERSON>); is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to <PERSON>James Woods</PERSON>, and then, if you watch the film (i don't recommend this part), you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories, totally predictable, with terrible acting performances, really bad special effects and incoherent events!.<br /><br />I deeply recommend not to see this film!, rent another movie, see another channel, go out with your friends, etc.<br /><br />3/10
1161 1 When I first saw this movie I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites. <br /><br />A River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON> (<PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON>) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education. <PERSON>Paul Maclean</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path.<br /><br />There is no downside to this movie. You will be entertained the whole way through. The acting, directing, and script is all perfect. The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score. Both of which entrap you in the world <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> creates for you. <br /><br />This is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic. It sure is in my book. If you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever.
1162 0 Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge <PERSON>Bon Jovi</PERSON> fan. In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much.<br /><br />But this isn't half as good. Not even <PERSON>Jon</PERSON> could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary. Apart from <PERSON>Jon</PERSON>'s character <PERSON>Derek Bliss</PERSON> none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy. Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl, no wonder she is so desperate for blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no atmosphere or sense of dread. I know the first Vampires being set in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension like that.<br /><br />The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants <PERSON>Berzier</PERSON>'s cross to be able to walk in daylight. However the story has less cool bits this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really don't care who or what this one is. There is no army of masters. Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> attraction then a creepy temple.<br /><br />So there you have it really. Lack of scares, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. A real let down for me personally.
1163 1 A River Runs Through It is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated. The acting is wonderful and understated, with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning. <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> gives a radiant performance and <PERSON>Tom Skerrit</PERSON> is powerful as the preacher father. The movie moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows, but it is well worth it in the end.
1164 0 Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today.<br /><br />As for the movie... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. Why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me--but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.
1165 1 as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie. especially one that i'd want to comment on. and it's not so much a point-counterpoint sorta deal; i just like to see what people say on the flipside.<br /><br />however, i do want to address one thing. many people that hated it called it, to paraphrase, 'beautiful, but shallow,' some even going so far as to say that norm's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot, at best.<br /><br />i'd like to disagree.<br /><br />as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction, i can relate. daily, you see them abuse themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks; it's really more how they are wired. on one hand, they are veritable geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (it's a lot like people like howard hughes Â— the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart) and all the while you see this, you know this, and what's worse, you realize you can't do a damn thing about it.<br /><br />for norman maclean, a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur, and who was to blame. in the end, no one is, and often, there is no why. but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes at all.
1166 0 I bought this adaptation because I really liked <PERSON>Anne BrontÃ</PERSON>«'s novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had.<br /><br />First of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in "North and South" and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant, it's definitely overdone and simply annoying. Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively.<br /><br />Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, he's very cute and the best feature of the film.<br /><br />SPOILERS <PERSON>Tara Fitzgerald</PERSON>'s characterisation of <PERSON>Helen Graham</PERSON> made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. She doesn't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. I just couldn't believe <PERSON>Markham</PERSON> could have fell for her and I'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago... Besides, he was the only main actor that sounded right to me. <PERSON>Toby Stephens</PERSON> I found just OK, <PERSON>Helen Graham</PERSON>'s brother not very good. <br /><br />Maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. Besides, what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic, (like when <PERSON>Huntingdon</PERSON>'s eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama! I mean, don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
1167 1 In a little town in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> two brothers grow up. One of them is <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> (<PERSON>Craig Sheffer</PERSON>), the other is <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>). Their father is Reverend <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion, and the lessons of fly-fishing. In this movie fly-fishing represents life, a little.<br /><br />The story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action. Probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen, but about the message. Some things do happen though. <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> goes to <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth</ORGANIZATION> to study. After six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emily Lloyd</PERSON>) and he is invited to teach in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> has become a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter". He is famous and it seems he has a nice life, but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much.<br /><br />The movie is very well directed, it has a nice score and all of the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography. The mountains, the woods and the river all look very beautiful. If the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch. Fortunately there is more.
1168 0 This film, like the first one ("The Man From Snowy River") has the same good and bad features, perhaps even more so than the original. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. <br /><br />The GOOD - Magnificent scenery, better than the first film. I love those high country shots in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Tom Burlinson</PERSON> is still a likable guy, as "<PERSON>Jim Craig</PERSON>." <PERSON>Bruce Rowland</PERSON> did a nice job with the music, too.<br /><br />The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine "Jessica" (<PERSON>Sigrid Thornton</PERSON>) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film, we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. Previously it was <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON>, now replaced by the always -profane <PERSON>Brian Dennehy</PERSON>. Speaking of that, it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord's name in vain. That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s. This film, like the first one
1169 1 Excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. Starting around 1910, he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family, friends, romances, etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale...."all things in life come together as one, and a river runs through it. And that river haunts me." Worth seeing.
1170 0 The original movie, Man From <LOCATION>Snowy River</LOCATION>, is one of the best I've seen, nearly perfect. A Lady and the Tramp storyline in two senses--rich girl/poor boy, and ability vs. bloodline. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous, overblown Disneyfied mess best summarized as "Rambo Meets the Black Stallion." Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence, and suddenly he's <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> on horseback; in the original, good film, he was real and believable, but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I've hardly been as disappointed in a movie, and at times this thing made me quite angry--they missed hardly a clichÃ©. Brazen audience manipulation--do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them, to make them happy? A mess of a movie.
1171 1 Upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times I have viewed it. The acting is stunningly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> is simply superb as the errant son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect. <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. All in all, this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s.<br /><br />You must see this movie!<br /><br />
1172 0 After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From <LOCATION>Snowy River</LOCATION>, WHY was <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON> replaced by <PERSON>Brian Dennehy</PERSON> in the sequel? It just wasn't the same without Spur and <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON>, as portrayed by <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>. Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--<PERSON>Jim</PERSON> returns after extended absence, to find <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> being pursued by another man. He could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him, and not find competition. For a <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> movie, this contains foul language, plus the highly unnecessary part when <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> & <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> shacked up without being married--very LAME. Quite an insult to viewer intelligence, according to members of my family. I'll stick with the first one, and try to forget I ever saw the sequel!
1173 1 The combination of reading the Novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and I to new levels. Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist <PERSON>Thomas Kinkade</PERSON> in one of his inspirational books; He states: "You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic. Nor do I think God had banal television programs, media hype, worthless purchases, and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe..." I hadn't seen "A river runs through it" in a couple of years, but after pondering <PERSON>Kinkade</PERSON>'s statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye. I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book (a must read). I have always been frustrated in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society. The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God's creations. A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the <LOCATION>Northwest</LOCATION> has driven me to move to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape, go fly-fishing with me, ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside. A place where you seldom worry about crime. I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls, rude snarling people in their <PERSON>Mercedez Bens</PERSON>, miles of vehicles on congested freeways, gangs, racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption, and everyone skeptical of each others intentions.<br /><br />Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. There is a lot of deep thinking in this film. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. It takes a compassionate, intelligent, and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning. If you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue, tone, light, colour, scenery, camera angles/movement, etc. Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks "The Fast and the Furious" is the greatest film. Granted it was entertaining but shallow.<br /><br />The bottom line: This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses. Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together. QUALITY NOT QAUNTITY
1174 0 This film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill "wonder of the human body" documentaries by bravely, if bizarrely, opting to elicit disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of...teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I'm not making any of this up. See this film if you must, but: bring your vomit bag, and don't have pasta salad beforehand.
1175 1 One of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive <PERSON>Brown Trout</PERSON> to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them.<br /><br />When we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in.<br /><br />This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons, <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pauly</PERSON> carried out the ritual. For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. You can't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to attune yourself to the place you are in, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and, depending on your skill level, you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike. The 'Art of Fly-fishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists.<br /><br />The title for the film could not be more aptly chosen, for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons. This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, by the the <LOCATION>Blackfoot</LOCATION> river, where the film is played out. It has the capacity to draw you in, to enthrall you, to capture you, as the history of the family, community and period is unfolded. The Story told is not just a family history, but a history of Life. What may be classified as a 'River of Life'
1176 0 I am compelled to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to SAVE YOUR MONEY. Almost any episode of <PERSON>Desmond Morris</PERSON>' "The Human Animal" or <PERSON>David Suzuki</PERSON>'s "The Nature of Things" could have bested the material presented. Not only does the director fail to make use of <ORGANIZATION>IMAX</ORGANIZATION>'s incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen, everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously. Viewers are introduced to a pregnant <PERSON>Heather</PERSON>, her husband <PERSON>Buster</PERSON>, and their niece and nephew. We follow them for an interminable forty-odd minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the trans-Atlantic <PERSON>Heather</PERSON>? Do we care? Avoid this film at all cost. If you do wish to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the beautifully photographed "<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically thrilling "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
1177 1 I have seen all the films directed by <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of <PERSON>Thomas Moran</PERSON> or <PERSON>Albert Bierstadt</PERSON>. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>, and stunning camera work by <PERSON>Phillippe Rousselot</PERSON> (Serpent's Kiss, <PERSON>Reigne Margot</PERSON>).<br /><br /><PERSON>Redford</PERSON>'s cast is perfect. <PERSON>Tom Skerritt</PERSON> is the Rev. <PERSON>MacLean</PERSON>, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, <PERSON>Brenda Blythen</PERSON>, the mother, and his sons, <PERSON>Craig Schaffer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both <PERSON>Schaffer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> films produced in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however, is the attention <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in <PERSON>Redford</PERSON>'s directorial hands. Given the material, <PERSON>Redford</PERSON>'s ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.
1178 0 Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, being a movie-freak, I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen. <br /><br />The plot is plain stupid, the directing is awful, acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to stand. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries--horrible). I can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, where normally the criteria are real tough (e.g. kill-bill (brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18). No one can call this a Horror movie, because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public (Showing the "Creep's" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence, that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialog is boring, honestly I can't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent.<br /><br />If I had something to say, I would ban this movie from the theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and I'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic.<br /><br />"Livin' the dream baby, livin' the dream" <PERSON>David Aames</PERSON>
1179 1 Have you seen The Graduate? It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before <PERSON>Dustin Hoffman</PERSON>'s character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia, <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON> and his brother <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WW1 <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> be a showcase for the American family, at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens, <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness, against time's current and back to when he was a boy. He and his younger brother <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad. Given the choice, little <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> would be the boxer, since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks, fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do, all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when <PERSON>Norm</PERSON> returns from his six years at <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth</ORGANIZATION>, things are very different. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> is at the top of his game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops, God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life. Father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. "Listen," their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON>'s family is unraveling? <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed. Mom, Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm. But the junior brother is losing his grip. <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> starts getting his life on track, finding love and career, but <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother, Father, Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help, but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature, yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> will ponder his entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him, yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an Oscar. Director <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well. But do go back and read the book, too. You'll see <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.
1180 0 I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to excite, really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it. I did get to like the character of <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by <PERSON>Jeremy Sheffield</PERSON> was not actually needed for this film and I think the director/writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>'s part, it may have worked - <PERSON>Jeremy</PERSON>'s acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it. Such a shame. Disappointing.
1181 1 I have read the short story by <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>, and the movie did justice to <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>'s writing. My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind. We have videos of many of Redford Â‘s movies and we have watched "A River runs through it" many times. <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> is part of the "famdamily" as he is always around. We never get tired of <PERSON>Redford</PERSON>'s perception of <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON> writings, and the beauty of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON>'s father. According to "A River Runs Through It," "Methodists are Baptists who can read," a line which by the way is not in the short story, but I think that is a funny line! My husband and I are well-read Baptists!<br /><br />I have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree. As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great. I love the scene where <PERSON>Norman and Paul</PERSON> as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> played by <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> (Se7ven) is the "perfect guy" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to <PERSON>Neal Burns</PERSON>, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: "Grace!" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where <PERSON>Jessie Burns</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emily Lloyd</PERSON>) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> proposes to <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> because he wants her to come to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> with him!<br /><br /><PERSON>Redford</PERSON> himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> to the young <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects, to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> because I have had the chance to see his works. <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> needs no special effects to show us the beauty of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities. <PERSON>Redford</PERSON> shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it.
1182 0 I was really, really disappointed with this movie. it started really well, and built up some great atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally got round to revealing the "monster"...it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems......again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another nutjob movie...like we don't already have enough of them.<br /><br />To be fair, the "creep" is genuinely unsettling to look at, and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy, but I'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human, albeit a twisted, demented, freakish one. When I saw all the tell-tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing...it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed.<br /><br />On top of this, some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /><br />Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard? Whats the point, apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says "HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE!"? Its stupid, and only seems to happen to prevent <PERSON>Franka Potente</PERSON>'s character from getting help.<br /><br />what the hells he been eating down there? I got the impression he was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose...so has he been munching rats all that time, and if so why do they hang around him so much? Why is he so damn hard to kill? He's thin, malnourished and not exactly at peak performance...but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non-psycho characters in the film.<br /><br />The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep, but I just find him loathsome. Its an effective enough movie, but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick.
1183 1 A stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place!! Be it, firecrackers going off, witnessing a robbery, a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it's path, or, for that matter, any other spectacular occurrence !! In the case of the <ORGANIZATION>Maclean Family</ORGANIZATION>, however, reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives..<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble...The <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly. His wife was God fearing, and dutiful. The two boys were, well...BOYS!!.. What else can you say?...<PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON> starred in this film before he was really THE!! <PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>, and his acting performance in this film was, to say the least, remarkable!!!.. His brother, <PERSON>Norman</PERSON>, was the cerebral type, he was touched by emotions that were genuine, and motivated by a set of values that <LOCATION>Missoula</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> concurred with!! <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brad Pitt</PERSON>) was a misfit from the offset, and lived on the edge...You would think that <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in the 1920's had no such thing, yet somehow, gambling, drinking, and violent confrontations, were as much a part of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, as was his fly fishing rod!! Fly fishing!! Did I say that? Parenthetically, this was the core of this movie's theme!! The recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> brothers, and to a lesser degree, the father!! I would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable, and the cinematography went beyond sensational.. Put it this way, anyone who sees this film will want to live in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.. Breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> brothers had for life...Seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish..The <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> brothers lived life to the fullest, and for better or worse, the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men!!...<PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> directs this film, and tells the story of the <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON>'s through the perspective of the older brother, <PERSON>Norman...Norman</PERSON> gets offered a position at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION> at age 26, and marries the woman he will always be in love with...What this film also points out, is that the younger brother, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!! The seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence, and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> family!! As most human shortcomings go, the <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> family made light of turbulent waters, (literally) and thus, established unity as a family, by putting necessary blinders on!!!<br /><br />The end of the movie "River Runs Through It" presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother.. For <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON>, stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years!! Such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away! The fond memories of his brother, his wife, his mother, and his father, must now be viewed philosophically!! For <PERSON>Norman</PERSON>, his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook, and precarious resolve! Something as simple as the statement "This was your life, and that is how you lived it" is a somber recollection of the joy, the sorrow, the regrets, and the love, he gave, as well as was the recipient of!! Best put in the last sermon he heard his father give, his father said "We can completely love someone without completely understanding them".. Whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not, it happened nonetheless! <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON> must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings! <PERSON>Norman Maclean</PERSON> has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life!! The murky waters of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth!! Without question, the very prolific statement of "what seems complicated is really very simple" purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie...More simply put...The people and places which were important in <PERSON>Norman</PERSON>'s life, are now only a bittersweet memory....merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s beautiful streams and rivers...To which, for the entire <PERSON>Maclean</PERSON> family, "all things merge into one and a river runs through it"
1184 0 All logic goes straight out of the train window in this British horror film, set in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> underground and starring the usually reliable <PERSON>Franka Potente</PERSON> (Run Lola Run), <PERSON>Franka</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station, only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by "someone" or "something" with killer intentions.<br /><br />Plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.<br /><br />All in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour.<br /><br />The only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor <PERSON>Ken Campbell</PERSON>, who's done better than this Â– that's even including "Erasmus Microman"!.
1185 1 In <LOCATION>Arlington Heights</LOCATION>, IL we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools (1961) so I rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the greatest thing on! I'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning wonderful cars (<LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION> or Oldsmobile) if the contestant got the final hidden picture game. I even had the home version!<br /><br />I wonder why this game lasted so briefly. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream.<br /><br />Really good memories are connected with Camouflage.
1186 0 This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Worse than the most abhorrent American dross; worse than Glitter - <PERSON>Mariah Carey</PERSON> in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it's not. It is abject rubbish from very bowels of Satan himself (who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it). <PERSON>Robert Jones</PERSON> as Exce Producer, spending our tax payers money (lottery money folks) on this piece of nonsense, should be accountable. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline??? I ask you - camp as a Christmas Tree, Deathline ... 'Mind the doors' is classic of really bad British film, we really don't need a reminder. And we certainly don't need a poor, second rate, badly scripted, badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this. All this this from the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men... I rest my case.<br /><br />Do Not Pay ANY money to see this. It is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash... our cash... for making it. They should hang their heads in shame.<br /><br />I am staggered at the low, low standard of this film. It makes me Mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show. <PERSON>Harvey Wienstein</PERSON> where are you? Come back, we forgive you!!!
1187 1 This game show lasted just one season, but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand. One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize, even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was a light-hearted show, but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive past one single season. Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show, as it proved to be quite unpopular, even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950's game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has as yet never been seen again.
1188 0 I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I didn't feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.<br /><br />I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. Haven't we seen this all before? I didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But then again I couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many questions need to be answered.<br /><br />Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.<br /><br />Not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.
1189 1 13 days to Glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the Mexican viewpoint. The major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON> played the part of <PERSON>Jim Bowie</PERSON> persuasively, the rest of the name actors in the cast <PERSON>Brian Keith</PERSON> (<PERSON>Davy Crocket</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Lorne Greene</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sam Houston</PERSON>) were too old.<br /><br /><PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> played General <PERSON>Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna</PERSON> with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle. The scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand. Failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military. <PERSON>Santa Anna</PERSON> was within his prerogatives to be angry. <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.<br /><br /><PERSON>Kathleen York</PERSON> was an impressive <PERSON>Susannah Dickinson</PERSON>, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, <PERSON>Kathleen York</PERSON> might have been reminded that as <PERSON>Dickinsons</PERSON> hailed from <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> they probable dis not sound very Southron.
1190 0 Creep - "Your journey terminates here." Some very graphic scenes and...well, yeah, that's about all for this film.<br /><br />No real plot, no storyline. No likable characters, well, 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is. I mean, they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing? why is he there?), that's quite scary I guess, but do I really care? No, I don't. Why don't I? Because I don't have a clue who these people are and I don't know if I should want them to live or die. It's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.<br /><br />This film lacks any meaning, any purpose. It feels like I fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up. It jumps right into the action. Basically, some women and her friends get locked in the <LOCATION>London Underground</LOCATION>, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.<br /><br />Creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are OK, but that isn't what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.<br /><br />It's nothing new. Another predictable modern 'horror', where <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> (the lead 'character') consistently does the stupid "hey, I know you lot sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! I'm going to do the total opposite because I'm a dumb blond" thing. I wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. In fact, I'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the, erm, grey alien-looking creature.<br /><br />"Your journey terminates here" is the films tag line. Well, Creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film. If you've had a few beers, got a couple of mates back at yours,then sure, watch it by all means. But if you want something original and clever, avoid.
1191 1 When <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> filmed his <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> story he had built a complete <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> set in the town of <LOCATION>Brackettsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> which is still there and quite the tourist attraction. As long as that stands, we will have a set for future <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> interpretations for the screen. One such with <PERSON>Dennis Quaid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Billy Bob Thornton</PERSON> was done in this century.<br /><br />But I would say The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best Alamo story filmed I've seen. <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>'s film is a good one if over-hyped, but it's a <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>. <PERSON>Brian Keith</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Davy Crockett</PERSON> here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.<br /><br />It's a lot closer to Professor <PERSON>Lon Tinkle</PERSON>'s book on The Alamo than the <PERSON>Wayne</PERSON> film was and having read the book years ago I can attest to that. Tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but Tinkle who was alive back then when the <PERSON>Wayne</PERSON> film was done and he was not pleased with the result.<br /><br /><PERSON>Alec Baldwin</PERSON> was around the right age for young <PERSON>William Barrett Travis</PERSON>, the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner. Back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. One thing that was not explored and hasn't been was <PERSON>Travis</PERSON>'s hyperactive sex drive. He was the <PERSON>Casanova</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>, he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests.<br /><br />But the man who always gets the whitewash is <PERSON>Jim Bowie</PERSON>, played here by <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON>. He was a hero at the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> to be sure, but his career before the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> was that of a scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to. But his heroic death certainly redeemed him. No hint of that is in <PERSON>Arness</PERSON>'s portrayal nor any others I've seen of <PERSON>Bowie</PERSON> on the screen. And of course he did design the <PERSON>Bowie</PERSON> knife, done to his specifications. That man needed such a weapon.<br /><br />However the main asset that The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory has is a full blown portrayal of <PERSON>Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna</PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the North Americans who've come to settle in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> at Mexican invitation. Unfortunately those Americans came with some pre-conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south, at least liberty for white people. <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Santa Anna</PERSON> who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also quite the scoundrel, but he was the best <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> produced until a genuine reformer named <PERSON>Benito Juarez</PERSON> came along.<br /><br />This film was the farewell performance of <PERSON>Lorne Greene</PERSON> who appears briefly as General <PERSON>Sam Houston</PERSON>. <PERSON>Greene</PERSON>'s not quite my conception of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, he really was way too old for the part, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> was in his early forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. But within the limits imposed on him, <PERSON>Greene</PERSON> does a fine job.<br /><br />For a romantic telling of The <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> tale by all means see <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>'s version, but for historical content I recommend this film highly.
1192 0 Basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'Death Line' which ironically was like this cobblers, also partly filmed at the disused Aldwych underground station.<br /><br />Making good use of the now disused Jubilee Line platforms at <ORGANIZATION>Charing Cross</ORGANIZATION> as well as the aforementioned Aldwych, this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not this film's strong point.<br /><br />Indeed strong points are sadly lacking. The gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-Gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device.<br /><br /><PERSON>Franke Polente</PERSON> has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often, indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film, out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.<br /><br />If creepy films set on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Underground are your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on DVD when it hits a bargain bin. If you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat).<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality well written and acted film, you will need to change trains.....
1193 1 This made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective, more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events, though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of <PERSON>Sam Houston</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bowie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Travis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Crockett</PERSON>.<br /><br />The focus here is on <PERSON>Jim Bowie</PERSON>, played with sharp, cynical detachment by <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON> who is apparently still alive at age 85. Then 65, he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part.<br /><br />Puerto Rican-born <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> humanizes Gen. <PERSON>Santa Ana</PERSON> as no one since <PERSON>J. Carol Naish</PERSON> back in '54 had done. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous, vainglorious popinjay--gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he has hired but, convinced of his own infallibility, he does not heed it.<br /><br /><PERSON>Alec Baldwin</PERSON> is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays: Col. <PERSON>William Travis</PERSON>. His portrayal is earnest. He is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him.<br /><br />The one jarring note was <PERSON>Brian Keith</PERSON> as <PERSON>Crockett</PERSON>. In a coonskin cap and carrying Ol' <PERSON>Betsy</PERSON>, he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie. With no conviction in the portrayal, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions. <br /><br />The script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions. We learn that <PERSON>Jim Bowie</PERSON> was, in the person of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, fighting his own brother-in-law. The Mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the Napoleonic Wars a generation earlier. "<LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> likes a bargain." <PERSON>Bowie</PERSON> wryly explains. The whole project of defending the former Spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill- advised--a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "The Alamo".
1194 0 This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. There are two routes to take in horror films: either you don't really explain what's going on (or who the killer is, like in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</ORGANIZATION>) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained (Halloween could potentially be an example of this).<br /><br />Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>'s character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.<br /><br />In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film.<br /><br />This film will go down as another example of a film (as most are) that could be so much better even though it would never be great. The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting: the characters, story, direction, and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.<br /><br />Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless, silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it...
1195 1 The best film on the battle of <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in March 1836, was <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>'s 1960 epic THE <LOCATION>ALAMO</LOCATION>. In a one shot job as director producer, that temporarily financially strapped him, <PERSON>Wayne</PERSON> demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the West.<br /><br />I have commented on that film in a review the other night, and I pointed out that <PERSON>Wayne</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Edward Grant</PERSON> (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle. They did bring in the issue of slavery. They also finally discussed the contribution of local Mexican land owner <PERSON>Juan Seguin</PERSON> as an important leader in the War for Independence on par with <PERSON>Crockett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bowie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Travis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. <br /><br />But there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film. <PERSON>Wayne</PERSON> worked hard to cast it properly, thinking of many people for lead roles in it. But, he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces, General <PERSON>Antonio De Santa Anna</PERSON>. The role was played by an obscure actor, <PERSON>Ruben Padilla</PERSON> (on this board, his thread shows only three credits listed). <PERSON>Padilla</PERSON> did not have any spoken dialog (even in Spanish). And while he does have one of the last shots in the film, he just is shown as a silent tyrant, observing the burning of the bodies of the Americans and their allies.<br /><br />Despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie (THE ALAMO: THIRTEEN DAYS TO CLORY), it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to American policy makers. <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON> was a wonderful stage actor. I was fortunate to see him in a production (in the late 1980s) of ARMS AND THE MAN in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, as <PERSON>Sergius</PERSON>. He was never boring, and usually first rate in his acting.<br /><br />Here we see the egotistical monster at his worst. Nothing is acceptable that does not fit <PERSON>Santa Anna</PERSON>'s wishes or activities. It can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough, or it can be the temerity of these "foreign brigands" (as he saw the Americans) in not knuckling down to himself, "the <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> of the West".<br /><br /><LOCATION>Santa Anna</LOCATION> was President of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> five or six times between 1830 and 1855. He claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a President because that President did not live up to the country's constitution, but it was the power that kept him going year after year. It is a sad commentary that he was the leading Mexican historical figure in those two decades. No political figure or military figure would rise to override him until <PERSON>Benito Juarez</PERSON> did in the late 1850s. Initially he claimed great liberal ideals, but he once admitted that the people of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves (and thus he sounds like <PERSON>Gilbert Roland</PERSON> in CRISIS talking about the people he has helped lead against <PERSON>Jose Ferrer</PERSON>). The amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back. His policies were disasters. While we know about his attack on <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> (to put down a revolt there), he also tried to expand into <LOCATION>Guatamala</LOCATION> (and probably saw himself controlling much of <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>). He did win at the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION>, but at great cost of lives. His massacre of Col. <PERSON>Fannin</PERSON>'s men at <LOCATION>Goliad</LOCATION> was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the <LOCATION>Alamo</LOCATION> who were fighting to the last, but <PERSON>Fannin</PERSON> had surrendered). Then came the disaster of <LOCATION>San Jacinto</LOCATION>, where his army was wiped out (he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the American troops). He was captured, and humiliated, and forced to sign a surrender of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Houston</PERSON> was kind to him: the troops wanted to string him up.<br /><br />Except for losing a leg in a battle against the French in 1838, he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars. He repudiated the forced surrender of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, but could not militarily undue it. Instead, he would lead <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the Americans, leading to the Mexican Session. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was "decent" enough to pay <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> $15,000,000 for the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> lost half of it's territory. He would be President for the last time in 1853, in time to give <PERSON>Franklin Pierce</PERSON>'s horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - <ORGANIZATION>Santa Anna</ORGANIZATION> sold the border of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> (the "Gadsden Purchase") to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> No other Mexican President (not even <PERSON>Porfirio Diaz</PERSON>) ever cost his country so much (<PERSON>Diaz</PERSON> did sell out to foreign business interests, but he built up <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s economic muscles doing so). He was exiled in 1855, and settled in <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>. There he managed to do his most creative work: he introduced chicle to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and it became chewing gum. Some achievement! <br /><br /><PERSON>Julia</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Santa Anna</LOCATION> is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s best land purchase agent. He is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment's notice. Most of the time his chief aide, Col. <PERSON>Black</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Ogden Stiers</PERSON>, here a British born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be. But Stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss. At the end, when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead Alamo defenders, <PERSON>Stiers</PERSON> suggests that they tell the world what <PERSON>Santa Anna</PERSON> is really like. And they did!
1196 0 Please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />So, it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later.<br /><br />So anyway <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> goes of to find <PERSON>George Clooney</PERSON> (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. Now <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the <LOCATION>London Underground</LOCATION>. Alone. Well, almost...<br /><br />So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.<br /><br />In short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. Or as the case may have it, Creep.<br /><br />I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw, Hostel or the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</ORGANIZATION> but for the rest of us, Scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.
1197 1 heres a fun fact, I was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) I am 19 years old now. my parents took me to try out for the part, we lived in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> at the time.I think I only made like 80 bucks for it, but i wasn't in it very long. My parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry. I was all mixed up. Strange and funny fact i suppose.. and no I am not a child actress. I am livin' in <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, workin' at a walgreens. I graduated here in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> but I lived in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> most my life. This Movie is a great movie, though, good concept. I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
1198 0 Okay I must say that before the revealing of the 'monster'. saying that he really didn't fit into that category, just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! And personally I think a granny could have ran away from that thing, but anyway. I actually was getting into this film, although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't come as an appeal. But such scenes as when she runs away from the train, and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen.<br /><br />But then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror, with limited thrills or scares. Slowly I became more bored, and wanted to shut the thing off. I like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it, specially the guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. I think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are! Just boring and well not worth the money.<br /><br />if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a mindless gore fest (which is limited, hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go, but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else, much better films out there.
1199 1 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting. The writing was top-notch. <PERSON>James Arness</PERSON> is a great actor and he showed it here. <PERSON>Brian Keith</PERSON> was too old to be <PERSON>Davy Crockett</PERSON>, and can anyone really play <PERSON>Davy</PERSON> but <PERSON>Fess Parker</PERSON>?<br /><br />Another great actor in this move was <PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON>, who gave depth to <LOCATION>Santa Anna</LOCATION>, a vain and complex person who led <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> through turbulent times.<br /><br />While some may think the movie was slow-paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. In this day and age when nobody stands for anything, I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time.
1200 0 ......in a horror movie that is. Alright first off , lets start with <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>. Her main goals include getting laid by <PERSON>George Clooney</PERSON>, looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but ..... instead she ran. I mean she didn't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late. I mean the guy tried to rape her. I cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night. The movie kept going on. And as a result lost all its credibility.
1201 1 <PERSON>Michael Bowen</PERSON> plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy <PERSON>Ray Wise</PERSON>) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy <PERSON>Clare Wren</PERSON>), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. An edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. It is an undiscovered classic.
1202 0 !!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichÃ©s in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check <PERSON>Heorine</PERSON> knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this clichÃ© list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> transport was as regular as the clichÃ©s turning up here . In fact there's so many clichÃ©s and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground . I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's slightly better than 1972's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> underground . it's just that when you think all the clichÃ©s have been used up in this film another clichÃ© comes along to raise its ugly head
1203 1 I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. <PERSON>Michael Pollard</PERSON> looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary "edginess" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.
1204 0 Yet another example of the complete waste of <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> Lottery money. Just how commercial did this film prove. The <ORGANIZATION>Film Council</ORGANIZATION> ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clichÃ©d, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline. Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. It's a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the <ORGANIZATION>UK Film Council</ORGANIZATION>, could have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.
1205 1 I have never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel like this movie was perfect. The colors, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies, and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon. I have seen other <PERSON>Carlos Saura</PERSON> movies and I agree that this film may be his best production. I feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION>. I appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras. While watching this movie I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fit like a glove. I don't know how I will be able to get a copy of this film in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures. It is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list.
1206 0 Absolutely laughable film. I live in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and the plot is so ill-researched it's ridiculous. No one could be terrorised on the <LOCATION>London Underground</LOCATION>. In the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs, etc. That there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely. Or that it's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age...<br /><br />The worst that's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them. Although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.)<br /><br />If it had been set in a city I am not familiar with perhaps I could have enjoyed it through ignorance, but it's not a high quality film so I just couldn't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is.<br /><br />I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating existed! Possibly the most disappointing film I ever thought I would like.
1207 1 The music of <PERSON>Albeniz</PERSON> pervades this film. Once and a while it is played with original instrumentation (e.g. piano, but never full orchestra), but often it is re-worked with various contemporary ensembles (e.g.guitar) and treatments (e.g. jazz piano). Only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film: the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I would guess that there are 12Â–14 scenes, which are not united by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer. In my case about half reached the pinnacle, though all the rest were in their own way very fine. Those that worked for me moved me to goose-flesh aesthetic delight; indeed, the final scene left me weepy with joy. And in some very magical way it brings you deep into Spanish culture. If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The film is virtually wordless, though each scene carries a title of an <PERSON>Albeniz</PERSON> piece. Seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> are available on DVD in the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION>. I am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of "Carmen," a spectacular work of art that is available in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> but not here (European DVD's won't play on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
1208 0 I was so disgusted by this film, I felt obligated to warn off others. This film has no story, plot or hint of purpose. The film starts after the standard "lets be scary" movie intro, which by now every film watcher has become accustomed. So we can ignore the beginning completely. We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static. (Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came. Having said that, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able. Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster. Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself to be an artist, has resulted in a film which will test your patience. It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said, "We have been watching this for 45 mins" did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience. Rather than suggest what the film is missing, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, bad-monster-guy-thing, about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours, days, weeks, months... and credits.<br /><br />Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes, but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film!
1209 1 Saturday June 3, 6:30pm The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION><br /><br />Monday June 5, 4:30pm The Neptune<br /><br />Few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as <PERSON>Carlos Saura</PERSON>'s brilliant interpretation of <PERSON>Isaac Albeniz</PERSON>' masterpiece <ORGANIZATION>Iberia Suite</ORGANIZATION>. At the approach of its centennial, <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. The twelve "impressions" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before <PERSON>Saura</PERSON>'s camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of <PERSON>Albeniz</PERSON> reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.
1210 0 I'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review.<br /><br />Given the setting, this movie could have been something really special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project"<br /><br />The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was really excited, directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although I don't think He managed to capture true eeriness of an empty <LOCATION>London Underground</LOCATION>.<br /><br />Characters were a big let down. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of crap, and you really don't care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy, who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not).<br /><br />The main villain, is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when he is revealed I was really disappointed. I won't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.<br /><br />All in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> formula. This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark.<br /><br />Just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain. INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY.
1211 1 If <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> hadn't done anything like this before, <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> would be a milestone. Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture, but he has done a lot like this before, and though we can applaud the riches he has given us, we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include Blood Wedding (1981), <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> (1983), <PERSON>El Amore Brujo</PERSON> (1986), <PERSON>Sevillanas</PERSON> (1992), SalomÃ© (2002) and Tango (1998). I would choose <PERSON>Saura</PERSON>'s 1995 Flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document, next to which <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> pales.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of <PERSON>Isaac Manuel Francisco</PERSON> AlbÃ©niz (1860-1909) and in particular his "Iberia" suite for piano. <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> AlbÃ©niz was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-Spanish audience. He moved to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers. His "<ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION>" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of <PERSON>Liszt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dukas</PERSON> and d'Indy. He traveled around performing his compositions, which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies, not as homogenized as <PERSON>Ravel</PERSON>'s Bolero but moving in that direction. Naturally, the Spanish have repossessed AlbÃ©niz, and in <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION>, the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles. But the source is a tamed and diluted form of Spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt Spanishness of pure flamenco. Flamenco, coming out of the region of <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION>, is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane, Hispano-Arabic, and Jewish cultures. <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> simply is the peninsula comprising <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Andorra</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION>; the very concept is more diluted. <br /><br /><PERSON>Saura</PERSON>'s Flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music, singing, dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style, the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are. <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer <PERSON>Antonio Gades</PERSON> and other artists. In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer <PERSON>Vittorio Storaro</PERSON>, another of the Spanish filmmaker's important collaborators. The beginnings and endings of sequences in Flamenco are often rough, but atmospheric, marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices. Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over, sigh, or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something. In Flamenco more than any of <PERSON>Saura</PERSON>'s other musical films it's the rapt, intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olÃ©'s that is the "story" and creates the magic. Because <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> has truly made magic, and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> is in a similar style to some of <PERSON>Saura</PERSON>'s purest musical films: no narration, no dialogue, only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region, beginning with a pianist playing <PERSON>Albeniz</PERSON>'s music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing. In flamenco music, the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice, and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music. It relates to other songs in other ethnicities, but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly-beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention. Then comes the clapping and the foot stomping, and then the dancing, combined with the other elements. There is only one flamenco song in <LOCATION>Iberia</LOCATION>. If you love <PERSON>Saura</PERSON>'s Flamenco, you'll want to see <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION>, but you'll be a bit disappointed. The style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there. But <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION>'s source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience.
1212 0 The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored, like they never happened. The lead character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some genuinely spooky/scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me. It's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser.
1213 1 I have seen a lot of <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> films and always found amazing the way he assembles music, dance, drama and great cinema in his movies. IbÃ©ria shows an even better <PERSON>Saura</PERSON>, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that called my attention is the fact that, in this movie, dancers and musicians, dance and music, are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing. The interest of <PERSON>Saura</PERSON> on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works. That's why I recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
1214 0 The <LOCATION>London Underground</LOCATION> has something inherently creepy about it, with its long winding tunnels, the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground, and of course the rats roaming the tracks.It a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often. It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat, featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel, and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> production Creep.<br /><br />I thought the film started off well, with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving, followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. However, Creep went downhill from here, and I found myself wishing that I'd switched it off after this opening scene, leaving me with a favourable impression of the film. All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable, even <PERSON>Potente</PERSON> herself, and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness. he also made the mistake of showing the "monster" in full lighting, where he ceases to become remotely scary, and reveals his name to be <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>. How can you have a monster called <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>? It turns into an X Files-type thing, and reminds one of the episode Tombs. In fact, I was wishing <PERSON>Mulder</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scully</PERSON> would turn up and sort them all out for me.<br /><br />As for the infamous sexualised violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally unnecessary. It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value. The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror, which is a mistake as it's only halfway through the film.<br /><br />So there you go. The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from <PERSON>Ken Campbell</PERSON>, one of my favourite occasional actors. You don't see him very often, but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius, unfortunately the only one evident in the film.
1215 1 Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially <PERSON>De Niro</PERSON>, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I've been for a while.<br /><br />It is a very funny and clever movie. The running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. That's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.<br /><br />I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.
1216 0 Creep is the story of <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Potente</ORGANIZATION>), an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train, and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station. After somehow meeting workmate and would-be rapist <PERSON>Guy</PERSON> on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed, things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city's streets. Her story is linked to that of <PERSON>George</PERSON> (<PERSON>Blackwood</PERSON>), an ex-con working in the sewer system; they meet in the final third of the film, brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them.<br /><br />The pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations; from the Tube station, they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery. Most Tube stations don't have toilets, so how one has a surgery is beyond me. Naturally, the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn't have running water. Yet it has electricity? Just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create.<br /><br />The monster itself is a problem. There's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions, it just kills people for no obvious reason. And then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either, perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time. I understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary, but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son, and a few shots of some jars containing babies, and yes, it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds. It also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak, communicating only in raptor screams, but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay. Hmm.<br /><br />This doctor business leads to scene that is the film's desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory, and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch, it just isn't enough. The final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed, and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason. <PERSON>George</PERSON> breaks down, unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again, and <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard. Yeah.<br /><br />After starting out as a "this could happen to anyone" movie, it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic. A complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid.
1217 1 Going into seeing this movie I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy.<br /><br />Little did I know that I was in for a ride through cinematic magic. Everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection.<br /><br /><PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> shines like the star she is in this movie. From beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character.<br /><br /><PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.<br /><br /><PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.<br /><br />Overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.
1218 0 This was an absolutely terrible movie. Don't be lured in by <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON> or <PERSON>Michael Ironside</PERSON>. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. <PERSON>Maria Conchita Alonso</PERSON> appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with <PERSON>Walken</PERSON> was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON>'s good name. I could barely sit through it.
1219 1 Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, <PERSON>Stardust</PERSON> tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON>(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to <PERSON>Robert Deniro</PERSON> playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. <PERSON>Mark Strong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jason Flemyng</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Ruppert Everett</PERSON> plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON> who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
1220 0 I purchased this film on the cheap in a sale, having read the back of the DVD case and assuming that either way I can't lose, it if was rubbish then no loss, if it was any good then bargain...<br /><br />Then I watched it...<br /><br />I am normally a fan of <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON>, but in this film he commanded very little screen presence, seeming not to do a whole lot, even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the "action" in the plot seems to affect him very little, and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic.<br /><br />Normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters, however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused, and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion...<br /><br />At this point I wept...<br /><br />I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing I have ever been subjected to, the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful, although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl. The acting was poor all round, the script and story was weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were but bluntly not all that visual. To summarise there are films which are good, films that are bad, films that are so bad they are good, films that are terrible...<br /><br />And then on a whole new level is "McBain"
1221 1 Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not. When i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And i was right. <br /><br />Stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. The storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like every tale , it has some short of morality. Therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that the true love is <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION> and not <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative. <br /><br />I have to give extra credits to <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. Moreover, she and <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable. The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make Stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie<br /><br />Overall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.I was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
1222 0 Okay, 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of <PERSON>James Glickenhaus</PERSON>' calibre.<br /><br /><PERSON>McBain</PERSON> is truly one of the most ridiculous, over the top action films I've ever seen, without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos, but how about making a film in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> that is set in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' <PERSON>Victor Argo</PERSON> as the much reviled '<ORGANIZATION>El Presidente</ORGANIZATION>'! Oh yes, we also have <PERSON>Maria Conchita Alonso</PERSON> overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism.
1223 1 I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) absolutely loved it... The advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder.<br /><br />Opened at #4 behind...<br /><br />#1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say).<br /><br />#3-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen, okay movie but 4th week out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion).<br /><br />#4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then <PERSON>Bourn</PERSON>, but that's been our for 3 weeks).<br /><br />Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytaleÂ… Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Awesome movie, go see it!
1224 0 A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.
1225 1 This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to "Princess Bride" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, "Stardust" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since "Return of the King" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!
1226 0 Wow, what can I say about this film? It's a lousy piece of crap. I'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did. What's wrong with this film? Here's a better question: What's NOT wrong with this film.<br /><br />The story itself is just crap and clichÃ©. Here's pretty much what it's about...Some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on, gets killed, and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge. "All" of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film. If you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it. Also, the second one isn't much better, so don't bother watching that either...I rated this movie a three because I liked the scarecrow's outfit, not because there was anything good about the movie. I think you get the picture.
1227 1 please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie!<br /><br />never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story.<br /><br />the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in. <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> is the perfect witch, and <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION>. Other big names make outstanding roles. I had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie. But once again, the story by <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON>, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.<br /><br />I watched this movie at a pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and do hope it will have huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. The look in the eyes of <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION>, the 'frivolities' of Captain <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable<br /><br />For me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it<br /><br />11/10 - Outstanding<br /><br />peace and love
1228 0 I'm watching this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible I can't stop watching it! I'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Some of the camera work is good. Most is very questionable. There are a few decent actors in the flick. Too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives. That's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! Music was a little better than the acting. If you get around to watching this I hope it's because there was absolutely NO other option! The sequel (yes sequel) is coming on now....I think I'll skip it! <PERSON>Jason</PERSON>
1229 1 What a wonderful, fanciful movie "Stardust" is.<br /><br />I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say, one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it.<br /><br />At a time when <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats, "Stardust" makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for.<br /><br />"Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. It has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms, and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern.<br /><br />"Stardust" is about a man from the town of Wall, which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom. The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by <PERSON>David Kelly</PERSON>). One day a young man from Wall named <PERSON>Ben Barnes</PERSON> out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech. He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called <LOCATION>Stormhold</LOCATION> where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named <PERSON>Una</PERSON>. She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is away, <PERSON>Una</PERSON> seduces <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> and sends him on his way. <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy.<br /><br />The boy, named Tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man (<PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON>) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another. Nevertheless, the young lady (named <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> and played <PERSON>Sienna Miller</PERSON>) goes out once with <PERSON>Tristain</PERSON> and he confesses his love to her. After they espy a falling star, she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and sets out on his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall.<br /><br />Meanwhile in the kingdom of <LOCATION>Stormhold</LOCATION>, the old king (perfectly played by <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON>) is dying. He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne. His sons' names are <PERSON>Primus</PERSON>, Secondus, Sextmus, and <PERSON>Septimus</PERSON>. The other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne.<br /><br />Anyway, he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and Voila, that what brings the star to earth.<br /><br />The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Clare Danes</PERSON>) and she, of course, is wearing the charm. But little does she know she is now being persuaded by <PERSON>Tristain</PERSON>, the Princes, and also an aging witch named <PERSON>Lamia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON>) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth.<br /><br />Complicated? Yes. But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds.<br /><br />Tristain is the first to find <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION> but is so blinded by his devotion to <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION>. His initial interest lie only in returning <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> as proof of his love. But he must get past the princes and <PERSON>Lamia</PERSON> first. The princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in "Pirates of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>" - never has death been so funny. <br /><br />But <PERSON>Tristain</PERSON> also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON>.<br /><br />His is the most important character in the movie and <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> plays it to a tee. He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter. Though his role is small in length, <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> is extraordinary!<br /><br /><PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> is wonderful as <PERSON>Lamia</PERSON> - a sexy evil witch. <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> is most appropriate as the confused and distressed <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION>. She makes a perfect damsel. <PERSON>Jason Flemyng</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adam Buston</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rupert Everett</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Mark Strong</PERSON> add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom, as they die return as ghosts ala "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits".<br /><br />Moreover director <PERSON>Matthew Vaughn</PERSON>, whose only other directing experience was "Layer Cake", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy.<br /><br />"Stardust" may be too complex for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times. It's that good. "Stardust" is what movies are supposed to be. Perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly directed, and perfectly acted. In other words...perfect.
1230 0 I've gotta say, I usually like horror movies that i've never seen... however, this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste. I'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types... but this particular movie was lame. The acting was horrible (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of <PERSON>Emily Rose</PERSON> come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish. If you want a movie to just pass the time, pick this one! The special effects are cheesy as heck. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can kind of see where that would come in. This will kind of remind you of the movie "Children Of The Corn." Independent movies rock.... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these movies would be for you.
1231 1 This is the epitome of fairytale! The villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure. <PERSON>Danes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Deniro</PERSON>,and <PERSON>Pfieffer</PERSON> are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Outstanding performances, delightful magic, funny and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous! I'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience, there are plenty of hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do this movie justice! My fiancÃ© and I were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that I can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try!
1232 0 Let's face it; some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow. Das no gonna happen neva! OMFG This stupid loser kid who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom. Right as he dies, he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow. The drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it. We later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with "Takes one to know one, loser!" The scarecrow flips off the building, calls him "daddy-o", and then beheads the poor man. We can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that. He goes on to kill many people, afterward. He mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people, just for some laughs. No laughing here. He adds a punchline to every kill, too. Every time he killed someone, he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines. In the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say "Here, have an EAR of corn!" then shove it up their ass. OR we can actually take an example from the movie! He just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him. Her father, the sheriff, yelled to the madman to stop, and he said "Hey, stay awhile!" and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree. In the end of the movie, he killed two guys and threw in the punchline "Gotta split!" and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad. Maybe next time this guy makes a movie, it won't be gay.
1233 1 If any style of film could be called my "guilty pleasure", it'd be this generic fantasy type. Guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as I'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. "Stardust" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> (or <PERSON>Gaiman</PERSON> adaptation, as it were). It isn't the visual dream-scape of <LOCATION>Mirrormask</LOCATION>, it isn't the adult pretension of Pan's Labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic The Princess Bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. Fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now.<br /><br />The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who, in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of Wall, goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. To make things difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION>, and he's not the only one looking for her... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.<br /><br />From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> as a gay pirate. On that note, <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON>'s performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON>'s own opening up into alternate forms of acting). <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> hasn't been so unique to his own image since <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and that's saying something.<br /><br />Stardust is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time. I can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to. It's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
1234 0 First off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "This entire movie had to have been a dare. You know, like, 'DUDE, I BET YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER'". With this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors, I'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. Yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school. It makes no sense. The Scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable. (SPOILER: At the end, when they chant <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>'s name and he reappears, the black guy and Scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief they were on their last scene, and at the cheesy dialogue.)
1235 1 Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.<br /><br /><PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (<PERSON>Sienna Miller</PERSON>), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>. Not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> and the prince son of King <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our "star" is wearing. Lots of bad chasing the good.<br /><br />Along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the <LOCATION>Carribbean</LOCATION>). <PERSON>Robert Deniro</PERSON> plays Captain <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON> as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.<br /><br />Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director <PERSON>Matthew Vaughn</PERSON>'s ("Layer Cake") effort deserves an audience. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess it will find big success on video.
1236 0 Perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films I ever did see. I'll start with the bad points of t he movie, which pretty much covers the entire film. First of all, something no one can avoid: TERRIBLE ACTING. I swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked. Secondly, BAD/UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK/DEVELOPMENT. You hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here. All you figure is that they deserved it one way or another. The scarecrow's character was overdone, and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killers such as <PERSON>Freddy</PERSON> or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The Scarecrow was full of horrid one-liners that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's go find some small animals to torture!" really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised. Last but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>? Like 30? The back of his head was balding for God's sake. There is much more I could say about this film, like it's cheap special effects, it's "high school film class" effort, but the point is understood. It's just bad film making at it's worst. As for what I found to be "good" in the movie: -Entertaining for those with low, low, LOW standards -Would help put insomniacs to sleep. -A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.
1237 1 This movie is wonderful.<br /><br />I was 'enchanted', i should say, and surprised because of how uniquely it was done. The cast, the sequencing, the effects...everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining, wholesome manner.<br /><br />For me, it is the representation of modern fairy tale. It's like the modern peter pan...simply amazing<br /><br />i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the market.<br /><br />This movie is really a double MUST SEE one...!!!! 10 stars for that!
1238 0 WOW is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it. trust me watch it!<br /><br />i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny! I cant believe they superimposed the school sign! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time. If a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it. heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well. all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first. its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out, just not like this one.
1239 1 I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clichÃ©, but I was completely wrong! <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.<br /><br /><PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>, who I did like before (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her even more. Her acting was fantastic, I couldn't even tell that she was American. The chemistry between her and <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect.<br /><br /><PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> were equally well-casted; <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> as that gay pirate...priceless, priceless. I laughed so hard at that one scene where <PERSON>Septimus</PERSON> comes on the ship...oh my god, wow. <PERSON>Pfeiffer</PERSON> played a decent villain, I liked her as the snippy mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie. <br /><br />Overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were, they were great; the cameos from <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> were also well-placed. <br /><br />I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. It kept my interest the entire time and I will be buying the DVD when it comes out!
1240 0 I saw this not too long ago, and I must say: This movie is terrible. I watch crappy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings. "Everyone picks on me. The only girl that thinks I'm not trailer-trash likes one of the guys that pick on me. I want to kill everybody. <PERSON>Wah</PERSON>." OK, I'm exaggerating. But the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies.<br /><br />Adding to what I just said, the kid's mom is promiscuous, he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on, mom's boyfriend tells him to leave, kid refuses, insisting that he isn't going to leave his own house. Boyfriend chases kid into corn field. He kills kid right in front of mom, mom screams in terror, boyfriend is like, "OMG! I didn't mean to!" Then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it. Kid was killed under a scarecrow, though. So, like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow, he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance. His victims "haven't been stalked like this before..." (Scarecrow's official tag line)<br /><br />To make matters worse, this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days. That's right, 8 days. I was going to give this movie a 2, because in spite of itself, it has one or two redeeming moments. (They're spoilers, so I won't spoil it for you, if you actually want to see this crap.) I could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting, the horrible special effects, the abysmal script, and the bad camera work, but I simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level.<br /><br />This movie isn't nearly as good as I'm making it out to be. If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you enjoy watching bad movies, like I do, then watch this at your own risk. Everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times.
1241 1 The beautiful story of Stardust is written by by <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON>. I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie. The story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a falling star Tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with. He is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.<br /><br />It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's charming and I feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which I haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s.
1242 0 Holy @#%& this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I rank this well below anything I have ever watched on film or TV, and thats saying something. I once witnessed a cow crap in a field. I watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half, who knows... it might have moved or something. Well that was time better spent than watching this tripe. The acting was non-existent, the plot was somewhere other than on this film. I think I saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> in hopes of becoming a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs. It's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and I'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Bah... I can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone. Let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this <PERSON>Chilton</PERSON> on the rack, walk to your car, start the engine, then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones vibrate anymore. Be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.<br /><br />By the way, I watched this after a "buddy" of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it. HE dint come over, SHE had too. Whats worse is that she had to watch this $%&@ thing TWICE! I heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this film.
1243 1 As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> *in particular*, I've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it's finally here. And you know what? I needn't have feared, the film version is bl**dy awesome. Different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.<br /><br />Proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing, and the casting in the main is a triumph, with the ghostly Princes (whose roll-call read almost as a "Who's Who" of currently cool British comedy - <PERSON>Rupert Everett</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Walliams</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Little Britain</LOCATION> fame, two of the blokes from <ORGANIZATION>Green Wing</ORGANIZATION> etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments, which exist in abundance. <br /><br />In fact, the one minor criticism I have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little OTT, subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON>' cameo, for example, was far too much just "<PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON> doing his usual <PERSON>David Brent</PERSON> from the Office comedy persona" for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness, from memory I believe the <PERSON>Ferdy</PERSON> character in the original book WAS pretty "<PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON>"-esquire when I think back on it)....<br /><br />But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON>, as the protagonist Tristan, captures the correct mixture of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a "humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest"; <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION> is beautiful, feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON>, in the cameo every reviewer is talking about, is indeed deserving of praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he's having a ball, too)... and <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch <PERSON>Lamia</PERSON>, my favourite performance of the film overall. If you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent "Hairspray" then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this, too.<br /><br />So to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent. One of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as The Princess Bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come.
1244 0 This movie is so aggrivating. The main character looks like he's 35 and I've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy. The plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor.<br /><br />Also some of the worst dialogue I've heard in 3 years, "lets go find a small animal to torture".<br /><br />Ugh.....I can't even continue, don't watch this pile of garbage, it was made in 8 days.<br /><br />The one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures.<br /><br />2 out of 10, unwatchable
1245 1 While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy <PERSON>Velma Von Tussle</PERSON> in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Just about all the actors like <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rupert Everett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> and many others do fine work here. While <PERSON>Danes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pfeiffer</PERSON> are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of <PERSON>Sienna Miller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Olivia Grant</PERSON> (as Girl <PERSON>Bernard</PERSON>), and <PERSON>Kate Magowan</PERSON> especially when we first meet her. Newcomer <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father <PERSON>Dunstan</PERSON> as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with <PERSON>Magowan</PERSON> (actually <PERSON>Ben Barnes</PERSON>). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust.
1246 0 Scarecrow is set in the small American town of <LOCATION>Emerald Grove</LOCATION> where high school student <PERSON>Lester Dwervick</PERSON> (<PERSON>Tim Young</PERSON>) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike. The poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers. Unfortunately he doesn't find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after <PERSON>Lester</PERSON> annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid. However something magical happens (no, the film doesn't suddenly become good), <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>'s spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell...<br /><br />Co-written, co-produced & directed by <PERSON>Emmanuel Itier</PERSON> who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr. <PERSON>Duforq</PERSON> although I don't remember any character of this name, I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible. The script by <PERSON>Itier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bill Cunningham</PERSON> & <PERSON>Jason White</PERSON> uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. We've seen it all before, we've seen killer scarecrows before, we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before, we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before, we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town Sheriff's make matters even worse before. The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? The answer is a resounding no to be honest. The film has terrible character's, awful dialogue, an inconsistent & predictable story, it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame. The film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't that exciting & the kills are forgettable. You know I'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn...<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Itier</PERSON> doesn't do a particularly good job here, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. Also I'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix (1999) or some Japanese kung-fu flick! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit. Don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? I know he's a killer scarecrow but I still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! There's no nudity & the gore isn't anything to write home about, there's a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in people's heads, someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days, well at least they didn't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development. Technically this is pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing... The acting sucks, the guy who played <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>'s mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & don't get me started on his accent...<br /><br />Scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable & very cheesy. If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows (1988). Not to be confused with the <ORGANIZATION>Gene Hackman & Al Pacino</ORGANIZATION> film Scarecrow (1973) or the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow (2008) which is currently in production. Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, Scarecrow Slayer (2003) & Scarecrow Gone Wild (2004).
1247 1 There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like <PERSON>Stardust</PERSON> did all throughout the course of the film. As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON>'s especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />Ten stars, and not a decimal less.
1248 0 The director states in the Behind-the-Scenes feature that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to <PERSON>Dario Argento</PERSON>, as well as other notable directors such as <PERSON>George A. Romero</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tobe Hooper</PERSON>. Basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. CAST PEOPLE THAT CAN ACT. Also, don't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood, 18 year old recluse. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing. Or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh..my.. God?" The scarecrow himself is quite a character. Doing flips off cars and calling people losers.<br /><br />The movie does have one redeeming factor... oh wait, no it doesn't.<br /><br />If you absolutely MUST see this movie, than just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude.
1249 1 The summer has been so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that I was woe to find a film I could just sit down and enjoy. <br /><br />In case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than <PERSON>Ella Enchanted</PERSON> (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds. Think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others... Maybe once or twice a month, if I feel active. I'm also a huge Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan. I get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.<br /><br />By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. Having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, the previews of Stardust seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary.<br /><br />As many others here, I was utterly surprised. I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichÃ©d from here to breakfast. Don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief... But the most refreshing thing I found, is that it's NOT based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie.<br /><br />((Unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another "Epic fantasy tale, the likes of LotR and the rest" so says the NYT and such and such no doubt.))<br /><br />Stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom. It didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). It's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough I could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy I hate those). <br /><br />I just... watched. Watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly CREATIVE storyline unfold before my eyes. Sure, I may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that. It even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater feeling better than when I'd gone in.<br /><br />It truly is a gem. After so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work I'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth.<br /><br />It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, <ORGANIZATION>Black Cauldron</ORGANIZATION>, The Dark Crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie. This little diamond is finding its way into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this.<br /><br />Simply wonderful.
1250 0 With all the excessive violence in this film, it could've been NC-17. But the gore could've been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend. There was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch, then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. The violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this. ALmost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off, but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "hoodlum" (though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, i know hoods and am part hood, they don't draw in class, they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher). The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters, but was just stabbed in the back. There were two suspenseful scenes in the film, but didn't last long enough to be scary at all. As i said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off. If the gore was actually fun to see, then it would've been nc-17. Two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields, they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was, they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines. His stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach, though i would've liked to see that. The acting was pathetic, characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts. I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes, i wont see it again anytime soon, but i enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, don't bother with the sequel, i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death, it sounds good but isn't. The original scarecrow actually kept me interested.
1251 1 This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw <PERSON>Neil Gaimans Stardust</PERSON> and all I can say is Wow.<br /><br />It is rare that I am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie I have ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON>'s fault.<br /><br />Sure, I could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart, flowed smoothly,and made the characters completely believable.<br /><br />I could go on for days about the spectacular acting, <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> is perfect as Tristan, <PERSON>Claire Daines</PERSON> is Brilliant as <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Robert Di Nero</PERSON> almost steals the movie as the Deeply in the Closet Pirate Captian <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>.<br /><br />The pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be Laugh our Loud funny, Intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like an 80's Sitcom, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie.<br /><br />Special Effects were near perfect, true this was no LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for, not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly.<br /><br />Then there is the story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap Princess Bride knockoff. It manages to be Familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time.<br /><br />Any one of those things would have made this a good movie, all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well. Once again <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> has done it, he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it. I didn't want it to end, I wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of <LOCATION>Stormhold</LOCATION> and get to meet Tristan and <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION> in person, to travel it's fields and valleys, Stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It is a feeling that I have noticed whenever I have read anything by <PERSON>Gaiman</PERSON>, The <PERSON>Sandman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>American Gods</ORGANIZATION>, Coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over, I could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one I am forced to live in and watching Stardust was no different.<br /><br />In the end I'm sure that <PERSON>Neil</PERSON>'s writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it.
1252 0 Spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone.<br /><br />This movie really annoyed me. It has a great looking monster, has some good low budget effects, some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad. Half way in I started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the DVD.<br /><br />The problems with this movie are many. First off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school. You don't believe anything from the get go as a result. The scarecrow, while looking great isn't much beyond that. He says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? Its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up. It seems more send up of every clichÃ© than heartfelt horror film. I some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it.<br /><br />Despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid. Even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks, you're paying too much.<br /><br />Avoid.
1253 1 The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, "Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream." By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. <PERSON>Freud</PERSON> might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.<br /><br />Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love to <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sienna Miller</PERSON>). <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> doesn't take him very seriously. So he pledges to bring back a falling star.<br /><br /><LOCATION>Stormhold</LOCATION> is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, <ORGANIZATION>Yvaine</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION>. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the witches is played by <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON>, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> (<PERSON>Robert de Niro</PERSON>). He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. Heirs of <LOCATION>Stormhold</LOCATION> meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the <LOCATION>Kingdom</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON> is an added extras. A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION>, so there is a nice little triangle going. Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.<br /><br />Stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of <PERSON>Harry Potter</PERSON> romps. Production values rival <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.<br /><br />That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.<br /><br />As a boy, I remember listening in wonder to albums by the <ORGANIZATION>Moody Blues</ORGANIZATION> (who practiced in a house not far from where I lived). They made records with names like "In Search of the Lost Chord," and wrote lyrics like, "Thinking is the best way to travel." I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from <PERSON>Timothy Leary</PERSON> to <PERSON>Aleister Crowley</PERSON>. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people might talk of <ORGANIZATION>NLP</ORGANIZATION> or positive thinking. Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still enjoy that feeling?<br /><br />You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look like they had a ball. Maybe you will too.
1254 0 Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.
1255 1 Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. Except for one of the <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight out of Ten Stars.
1256 0 This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory. HOWEVER, everything else sucks. The director, <PERSON>Emmanuel</PERSON>, is quite incompetent at film-making. He uses some of the most idiotic shots ever.<br /><br />- a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film. I don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn't. It was stupid. Random shots of the trailer the main character lived in, random buildings, random pan shots of buildings, random cat which walks away. WTF? And clouds. Lots of gloomy dark clouds.<br /><br />- he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him. Instead of just one shot, he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid.<br /><br />The acting is horrible but it's what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope. A simple corncob in the ear . The love interest was hot. Voluptuous. Which is why this movie gets a 2.
1257 1 This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.<br /><br />People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism.<br /><br />Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)
1258 0 I desperately want to give this movie a 10...I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies are so budget that they are good. A wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry...definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system. The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy...ninja... puberty-stricken... pre-thirty year old student...non-cowboy drawing...wise-cracking...son-of-a-bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year. All I can really say is, 'can you dig it' and recommend watching movies such as Frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror.<br /><br />(WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY SMOKING!?'
1259 1 The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, <PERSON>Harry Potter</PERSON> and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON>, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
1260 0 This movie could be used in film classes in a "How Not to Script a B-Movie" course. There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie: Budgets are tight, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but I'll just mention one: The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />The "story" of Scarecrow goes something like this: <PERSON>Lester</PERSON> is a high school kid (played by and actor who'd I'd peg to be in his early 30's) who is picked on by the other kids. He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named <PERSON>Judy</PERSON>. His mom is a lush and the town whore. One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings (by calling him a "faggot" for drawing birds instead of "monsters and cowboys." If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows) and later, kills <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>, in a cornfield, under the titular scarecrow. Magically, <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>'s soul goes into the scarecrow. Somehow, this transference changes <PERSON>Lester</PERSON>'s soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast (I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a Kung-Fu scarecrow. I disagree. The scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie). The scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him, those who smoke pot in the corn field, those who dig graves, boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers, pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.<br /><br />The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned. The director (a Frenchman) does an impromptu version of rap music, admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by (and I'm paraphrasing): "Life ez a bitch, but et has a great ass"<br /><br />Number of Beers I drank while watching this movie: 5 Did it help: No Number of <ORGANIZATION>Beers</ORGANIZATION> needed to enjoy this movie: Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level.
1261 1 I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.<br /><br />Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.
1262 0 Amazing. That's what you'd say if you sat through this film. Simply, incredibly, amazing. It's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing. That, my friends, is what is truly scary about this film. Somebody thought it was a good idea to make it. <br /><br />Well, here's another amazingly original story: High School student (occasionally seemed like collegeÂ—go figure) has whore for a mom, lives in a trailer park, and is an "artist" who is ridiculed for his "being all different." Well, of course, this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and, here's the original part, his soul inhabits a scarecrow (beneath which, he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john). Then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him. Awww.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--Amazingly funny movieÂ—even if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.<br /><br />--This and the sequel on one disk in the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> $5.00 binÂ—so it's only a little overpriced.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br /><br />--The violence and gore are kind of sub-standard. One person is stabbed with a corncob.<br /><br />--Sounds like they put some effort into the musicÂ—but it doesn't really fit the movieÂ—and isn't all that good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--Terrible, terrible acting.<br /><br />--Another slasher let-down with sexy womenÂ—none of them removing clothing. When did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??<br /><br />--Ridiculous story.<br /><br />--The scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make <PERSON>Freddy Krueger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arnold Swartzenegger</PERSON> blush.<br /><br />--Standard underlying love story goes nowhere, and is poorly done.<br /><br />--Some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomÂ—you never really know who anybody is and then they're killed. And you only assume that they must've had it coming.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--Extremely average slasher fare, just with a murdering scarecrow instead ofÂ… well, all that other crap.<br /><br />--Nowhere near as interesting as <PERSON>Freddy Krueger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jason Voorhees</PERSON>, Pinhead, <PERSON>Chucky</PERSON>, or even <PERSON>Angela</PERSON> from the "<LOCATION>Sleepaway Camp</LOCATION>" seriesÂ—all of which are better than this atrocity.<br /><br />--The absolute worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE. The script is laden with a level of retardedness that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious hereÂ—it's a full step beyond terrible. Don't get me wrong, though, it's funny as hellÂ—but I've never heard more asinine banterÂ—even in "Slumber Party Massacre III." This film makes "Jason X" look like <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>.<br /><br />--The man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow: Worst wig ever. Dialogue to match.<br /><br />Memorable Scene:<br /><br />--The one where elementary-school youths spew out their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's go find small animals to torture. Huh huh."<br /><br />Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 5/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 (No nudity, Mom's a whore, girls wear no bras) Violence/Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, blatant, over-the-top and painfully funnyÂ—so bad it's good. My first rating for dialogue in any film!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10<br /><br />Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10<br /><br />Overall: 3/10<br /><br />Another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap. Or Slasher-film completists. This is not a good movie, at all. Laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring.<br /><br />www.ResidentHazard.com
1263 1 This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. <br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters.<br /><br />One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.<br /><br />Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.
1264 0 Well, what was fun... except for the fun part.<br /><br />It's my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than '<PERSON>Lazarus</PERSON>' and 'Ghost in the Machine'.<br /><br />Let's start with the good. The teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover that I am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.<br /><br />But then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. Little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. There were about one or two quotable lines. <br /><br />and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. In the end... what's the point? they all pretty much died. We didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and I couldn't even find <PERSON>Sophia</PERSON>'s death sad... just very frustrating.<br /><br />* star. shame because Season 2 was doing so well.
1265 1 OK here is how I do this. I grade movies on 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. It can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.<br /><br />Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The Action was fun and exiting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.<br /><br />Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.<br /><br />Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, I found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.<br /><br />FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had it ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> was wonderfully wicked, <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> made Tristan come to life, <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> the same again.<br /><br />Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER look and <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> the same again.<br /><br />Character development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.<br /><br />Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, funÂ… even the mush had good dialogue.<br /><br />Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.<br /><br />Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.<br /><br />Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! See it in the Theatre? Most definitely! Bottom Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre, I know I'll be going back for seconds!
1266 0 The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. <PERSON>Walter Connolly</PERSON> is laughable as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, as do most of the lead actors, that I could not bear listening to him speak.<br /><br />It is a shame that <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans.
1267 1 Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007)<br /><br />The marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so I doubt most of you have heard about it. In truth, I hadn't either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when not working so I an enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as 'that <PERSON>Neil Gaiman</PERSON> movie'. What is it about? Well, in short, it's a <PERSON>Gaiman</PERSON> fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. <PERSON>Rumour</PERSON> has it, <PERSON>Gaiman</PERSON> might be something of a writer.<br /><br />Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect.<br /><br />Oh how sweetly wrong I was.<br /><br />Yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom. But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, <LOCATION>Eragon</LOCATION>). It was much more intimate than all that.<br /><br />But, like Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. It's surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. And that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick Shrekism. It's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review thing.<br /><br />Acting is, in the very least, good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. <PERSON>Michelle Pfieffer</PERSON> is not, sadly, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. <PERSON>Rupert Everett</PERSON>, though, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> is, well, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> frickin' O'Toole -- which is marvelous. <PERSON>Ricky Gervais</PERSON> is perfectly cast and shows why. <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of.<br /><br /><PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>. <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>. <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON>. I've always been of mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. In this, she's the former. And she is, quite literally, the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when <PERSON>Cox</PERSON> isn't in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself.<br /><br />Special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet -- sorry <PERSON>Potter</PERSON>. Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>. All else is top bracket.<br /><br />And now that that's done...<br /><br />...the writing. Oh, the writing! <PERSON>Neil</PERSON>, you devil. It's hard in today's climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what's new? But <PERSON>Gaiman</PERSON>'s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And, though you suspect how it's all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. Fantastical and real.<br /><br />(I wish I could talk about <PERSON>Septimus</PERSON> vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, rest assured, it's done properly.)<br /><br />Those I spoke to afterward had the same impression I did. A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. You'll know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /><br />Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I'm still confident that years form now, there will be the same "Oh, I love that movie," response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.
1268 0 Well I'm probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site, but The Good Earth is one of the worst structured films I've seen in a long time. We have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again. <br /><br />Well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it. You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. However, the film then continues on for a whole other hour. And in this remaining time, its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers. Oh yea and the age old, money is the root of all evil blah blah blah. Just because you know your making an epic film doesn't mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to. Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. Then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman, and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film. <br /><br />Oh wait and the film isn't the only thing thats poorly written, the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense. She complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda. Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. Even if they are starving at the time of this idea, it still doesn't make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again. <br /><br />There are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to. The only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography. The land is shot beautifully, oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive. Too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say. <br /><br />One last thing. I know that at this point in time <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything. For most of the film <PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON> does portray an Asian man to the best of his ability, but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old Italian <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, they even cut his hair so he looks like <PERSON>Tony</PERSON> from Scarface(also a better film than this). Of all the main characters in the film I think maybe three are actually Asian, the rest are just Americans being silly. Oh and please Ms. <PERSON>Rainer</PERSON> that was a really nice one note performance, not, if i could i rip the Oscar out of your hands, oh i would. <br /><br />The Good Earth is one epic waste of time. If you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get The Grapes of Wrath, a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets. Mainly because it wasn't written by a monkey.
1269 1 I was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film.<br /><br />Stardust follows Tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and a magical kingdom known as <LOCATION>Stormhold</LOCATION>.<br /><br />This film was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny. If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic.<br /><br />All the performances are outstanding, the beautiful <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> makes you love her in her portrayal of <LOCATION>Yvaine</LOCATION> the trusting naive star and under rated <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> delivers a stellar over the top performance as Larnia...but the performance to talk about is <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON>...In every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show...<br /><br />If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film. Guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> to keep you entertained throughout. The cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film...nothing about the film seems forced.
1270 0 <PERSON>Luise Rainer</PERSON> received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. <PERSON>Luise</PERSON>'s character was a slave then given away to marriage to <PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON>'s character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that <PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON> received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what <PERSON>Luise</PERSON> must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> does often. <PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON> has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt <PERSON>Luise</PERSON>'s performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
1271 1 I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br /><br />The plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.<br /><br />My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.
1272 0 A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Wang Lung</PERSON> (<PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON>) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (<PERSON>Luis Rainer</PERSON>). American stars appear in the leading roles, talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. <PERSON>Luise Rainer</PERSON> won an Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand <PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON> gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again. Another problem with the movie is the ending. It seems like <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> did not know when to end the picture. This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of Chinese culture and traditions.
1273 1 Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. I wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!<br /><br />For anyone that loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. <PERSON>Robert DeNiro</PERSON> is hysterical. Relative newcomer <PERSON>Charlie Cox</PERSON> is an incredible leading man. <PERSON>Claire Danes</PERSON> is fantastic as always. <PERSON>Michelle Pfiefer</PERSON> is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters...even down to facial expressions.
1274 0 The Good Earth is not a great film by any means, it is way to ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer. It is not very interesting to me. Yes, <PERSON>Luis Rainer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON> do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long. I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act. In short <PERSON>Wang Lung</PERSON> (Muni) a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him. Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds. The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next. Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments, it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis.
1275 1 Okay, this show is nothing but AWESOME! It has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses. <PERSON>Jeremy Sumpter</PERSON> is so hott and he is perfect for the role! He is gunna be big in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. He has a bright future ahead! This show better last a long time because I really love this show, and I hope that it has a lot of success! It is so interesting. I have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here, and it's great! I tape it, too. I can watch it whenever I want now! Too bad its only on once a week though. I wish it was on at least twice a week because now I wish that it was Tuesday every day! Hope you all like this show!<br /><br />~<PERSON>Ashley</PERSON>~
1276 0 The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is borderline comical. While I love <PERSON>Paul Muni</PERSON>, I can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice. The only saving grace I found with this film is it's production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time. Other than the production value I can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film.
1277 1 To anyone who might think this show isn't for them, please give it a try. Network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people. This show is a return to family oriented TV where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are about, and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime. <PERSON>Jeremy Sumpter</PERSON> is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today, and he is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional <ORGANIZATION>New York Empires</ORGANIZATION> (great name!). <PERSON>Dean Cain</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christopher Lloyd</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mare Winningham</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Kirsten Storms</PERSON> round out the main cast, and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen. Hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch <PERSON>Pete Young</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sumpter</PERSON>'s character) learn and grow.
1278 0 The clichÃ© of the shell-shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment. Pity a splendid cast, acting to the limits of their high talents, can't redeem 'The Return of the Soldier' from its stiff-collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement. Best moments, as another reviewer noted, come when <PERSON>Glenda Jackson</PERSON> is on screen; but even <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s crackling good cinematic power can't pull this film's chestnuts from its cold, never warmed hearth. <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON>, she of sex-kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability, finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh-flawless <ORGANIZATION>Middlesex</ORGANIZATION> accent. The hackneyed score, redolent of many lackluster TV miniseries' slathered-on saccharine emotionalism, is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script, blocking, and overbaked formalism of the direction; except for its score and corseted script and direction, 'The Return of the Soldier' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together.
1279 1 This is a good family show with a great cast of actors. It's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late. There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either, unless you count <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arcadia</LOCATION> as being similar because it has a teen lead character too. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a look because <PERSON>Jeremy Sumpter</PERSON> gives the main character (<PERSON>Pete Young</PERSON>) a kind of likability and naivetÃ© that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly. <PERSON>Dean Cain</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christopher Lloyd</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mare Winningham</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Kirsten Storms</ORGANIZATION> round out the rest of the main cast members, and each is terrific in their role. I really like <PERSON>Kirsten Storms</PERSON> as <PERSON>Pete</PERSON>'s sister <PERSON>Betsy</PERSON>; she is quite a pill, but she still cares about her mom and brother, even though she hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to really find it's legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while, so check it out people--you'll be glad you did!
1280 0 Chilly, alienating adaptation of <PERSON>Rebecca West</PERSON>'s book about an Army Captain returning from duty in WWII with his memory impaired (now there's an original idea!). It seems he remembers old flame <PERSON>Glenda Jackson</PERSON> but not current wife <PERSON>Julie Christie</PERSON>, which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks. This extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man <PERSON>Alan Bates</PERSON> with director <PERSON>Alan Bridges</PERSON> and co-stars <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Ian Holm</PERSON>, but the burners are all on low. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> is on-screen), but Bridges' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film's dulled-out color is enervating. Long on the shelf, this "Soldier" is best left forgotten. *1/2 from ****
1281 1 me and my sister saw the premiere last night... it was so good we were glued for the whole thing.. hahaha..i think I'm hooked for the season!!.... they have some really good actors in this thing.. the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don't really understand how they'll keep it stretched for a whole season.. there will probably be some big twist tho..i cant wait till Tuesday.. finally <PERSON>Jeremy sumpter</PERSON> who is he? i can tell hes going to be big!! he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away.. cant wait for the next episode.. GO <PERSON>Jeremy</PERSON>!<br /><br />'Aimee
1282 0 In my knowledge, <PERSON>Largo</PERSON> winch was a famous <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> without the spy life! So, when I had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>!<br /><br />But, just after the opening credits, I got heavy doubts: when American movies offer amazing start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene Â… Then, the story get very complicated with financial movesÂ… I thought I lost the kid.<br /><br />But, strangely, he had been caught by <LOCATION>Largo</LOCATION>, and more than <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>! <br /><br />Was it the excellent interpretation of <PERSON>Tomer Sisley</PERSON>? The difficult relationship <PERSON>Largo</PERSON> has with his father? The multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? The exotic locations of <LOCATION>Honk-Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yougoslavia</LOCATION>? <br /><br />Dunno, but he really cares about <PERSON>Largo</PERSON> ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
1283 1 This show has a few clichÃ©s and a few over the top, <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s Creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talking about way back when life made sense?), but overall it seems like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. I just hope every episode doesn't turn out to be life-altering like the first, that would just be too much drama for this vehicle. <PERSON>Jeremy Sumpter</PERSON> does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of.
1284 0 First of all, if you'r a fan of the comic, well, you'll be VERY disappointed I'm sure ! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic, now suddenly he becomes croatian, pfff! chicken producers, it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks croatian... Lol ). The striking <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> Winch building becomes a common average-small yacht in H.K. The good looking Largo becomes some unshaved Tzigan/Turkish looking guy. <PERSON>Freddy</PERSON> the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes some fat, out of shape, sad, average guy. <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Largo</PERSON>'s good buddy, does not exist at all !? He gave some pepper ! <PERSON>Largo</PERSON> doesn't throw knifes at all, but just some snake stares... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV-film. French directors and producers, if you don't have the money, the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic, please stick to some romance shooted in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. Very very bad film, good thing I just rented it, don't count on me to watch the sequel ( If there is any ! ).
1285 1 I was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a French actress friend of mine.<br /><br />For the first half hour I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the <LOCATION>New Beverly</LOCATION> theater in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, hating this film, hating myself and even hating the French actress. And then...<br /><br />I don't know what happened but I was pulled into the film in a way that I hadn't been in years. And this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand. I was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it. <br /><br />I believe that great movies pull you inside a world, make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink. This film did that. It was one of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
1286 0 I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie was pain for me. I had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep. It was boring! How can somebody ruin this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were sh.t. They can't live the role. The main actor(<PERSON>Tom</PERSON> ... ) is a null. Watch the other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable,somehow they were not to follow the situation. Like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors.Maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title. French can't do right thing with big films,like Alien 4. That was bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
1287 1 Since my third or fourth viewing some time ago, I've abstained from <PERSON>La Maman</PERSON> et la putain while I wait for the DVD. In the meantime, I've read the french screenplay as well as <PERSON>Alain Philippon</PERSON>'s monograph on <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON>. The latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc, and in-between, impossible to see or, in the cases of Mes petites amoureuses and Le PÃ¨re NoÃ«l..., re-see.<br /><br />A few questions that hit me this moment: Polish VÃ©ronika's French is plenty colloquial (un maximum d' "un maximum d'"). Even so, does she have an accent? I think I can tell she does. What does the absence of color add, especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed? How does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of The Tempest and The Winter's Tale? Ditto Alphaville. We may imagine the elapsed years since have done it, but does <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu? Is this an enchanted isle? Is <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>'s a fairy tale? <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>'s always choreographing himself, worrying about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does. Or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself? How different is he from Vertigo's <PERSON>Scottie</PERSON>? (I say, I think, very.) What's the difference, and is there one, between <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>'s LÃ©aud, and <PERSON>Truffaut</PERSON>'s, and <PERSON>Godard</PERSON>'s? How different is the present LÃ©aud? Isn't he still doing it, whatever it is, in recent roles, <PERSON>Irma Vep</PERSON>, <PERSON>Le Pornographe</PERSON>, whatever, approaching old age? Once I arrived early for one in a series of mostly <PERSON>Antoine Doinel</PERSON> (LÃ©aud's character) <PERSON>Truffaut</PERSON> films. For a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, LÃ©aud hair, with a direction-seeking nose. I have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry. I was that age, but have no idea what I myself looked like then. No scarf, at least. I do have a brother, though, who seems to have learned his carriage from <PERSON>Bresson</PERSON>.
1288 0 We have all been asking ourselves "why don't they remake the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking the ones that were great already, that way they can only make it better?" well with Prom Night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s <PERSON>Jamie Lee Curtis</PERSON> film and made it even WORSE. Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.The cast who include <PERSON>Britney Snow</PERSON> (who was superb in Hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.More annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it). It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!! Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original.I've seen scarier OC and <ORGANIZATION>Dawsons Creek</ORGANIZATION> episodes
1289 1 A have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an SOB who has a long term girlfriend. Of course the SOB is very good-looking, charming, etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching <PERSON>Jean Pierre Leaud</PERSON>'s character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends. It's tragic, and you know she's going to end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do. <PERSON>Leaud</PERSON> is brilliant. Totally empty. A blank throughout, he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants.<br /><br />The scene two hours in when <PERSON>Leaud</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lebrun</PERSON> have made love, and the next morning he puts on a record and, very sweetly and charmingly, sings along to amuse her is brilliant. The "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.<br /><br />It's a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema. Takes a while to get into, but then the time just disappears.
1290 0 When I first saw the preview for this movie, I really couldn't wait to see it. The plot seemed good and the setting was great. I mean, a slasher movie that takes place on prom night, great idea!! And the plot: A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students, goes crazy, gets arrested, and escapes three years later on prom night! Prom night, a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable, turns into hell!! However, I saw it and was extremely disappointed. It was not only the worst "horror movie" I have ever seen, but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen!! First of all, it wasn't even scary. There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat. Also, the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull. All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats. Also there was absolutely no gore (its rated PG-13). The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl. He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them (they don't actually show him cutting her throat).<br /><br />Next, you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie. He isn't mysterious, creepy, or scary. He's just this guy who kills people.<br /><br />Also, everything in the movie was so clichÃ©. An example is when, at the end, the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment, the detective shoots and kills him. Also, every single thing in this movie was so predictable. The victim, after seeing the guy with a knife, runs for her life, hides, thinks she gets away, and then the killer just pops out and kills her.<br /><br />Finally, the sequence of the movie was extremely bad. The guy goes into the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm, and everyone evacuates. The main character forgets something in her room, has an encounter with the killer, runs and escapes. Thats it! She and her boyfriend go home, the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house, finds the girl, then gets killed by the detective. The movie sequence was so stupid and clichÃ©.<br /><br />If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good, trust me, don't waste your time or money. No wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater. My friend and I, along with these two girls sitting in the back, were the only ones in the theater. That should have told me something about the movie beforehand.
1291 1 I hate over-long over-talky French movies, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest French movie of them all. I saw it twice in the mid-70's, and then it disappeared. But I finally got to see it again in 1999, and fell in love all over again. What is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. If you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
1292 0 i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident...well it must of been. blonde women being stalked,the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing,hiding.he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it.he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do.<br /><br />the old "mirror in the bathroom"is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago. you had the cop on the trail of the villain,another clichÃ©(played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent,he's from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>) the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of clichÃ©'s and make's "scary move"which was a COMEDY look scary. pathetic!

1294 0 The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay. It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone kept dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really made this an OK film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably.
1295 1 Well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on. Unlike many of you I have only seen <PERSON>La Maman</PERSON> et La Putain twice. As many good films, I noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing. All that I know is what I have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until I myself have acquired the dvd. I have yet to figure out precisely why I enjoy this movie so much, but really, what do I care why? Though I'm sure I could and will form some wonderful explanation. All right, so you may disagree, perhaps it is a bit boring at times, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a lovely <LOCATION>Grushenka</LOCATION>.
1296 0 The night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.<br /><br />There really is no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.<br /><br />The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame <PERSON>Robbie Williams</PERSON> lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.<br /><br />The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.<br /><br />I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. Don't do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a sheet to play ghosts with.
1297 1 I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I would have to say it was worth the effort. However, you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes. If you don't have the staying power, get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights.<br /><br />Now to the film, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't mind, here goes: <br /><br /><PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman called <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>. <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> owns a retail shop and she provides for <PERSON>Alex. Alex</PERSON> spends his days at cafÃ©s and restaurants. The story reveals that <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> had previously impregnated <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON> whom he used to live with. <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON> dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> had abused and battered her. At this point, <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON> had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. <br /><br />By chance, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> meets a nurse nymph called <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> and they striked up a relationship. <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> fell in love with <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> struggles for <PERSON>Alex</PERSON>'s affection and had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois to boot. Finally at the end, it's revealed <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> is pregnant with <PERSON>Alex</PERSON>'s child and <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> asked her to marry him. We assume (as aforesaid with <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON>'s situation) <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family. There is hope! <br /><br />With the title of "La Maman et la putain", I deduce <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> was relating to FranÃ§oise <PERSON>Lebrun</PERSON>'s character of <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON>. She was a whore and then she became the mother. Hence, the mother and whore is the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very chatty, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. <PERSON>Lebrun</PERSON> and LÃ©aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed. <br /><br />Not a bad effort. 7/10.
1298 0 OK this movie was made for one reason and one reason only TO MAKE MONEY!!The producers obviously didn't care about killing a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg-13 how many pg-13 slashers movies have turned out to be good? Thats like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NONE!! Prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that.<br /><br />My problem with Prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him.....................<br /><br />1)The way he escapes, he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent!! WHAT THE HELL? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2)His intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self, he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her, so does he want to kill her, love her or just plain rape her?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all of his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn't notice, it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible,silly,stupid attempt at a horror movie
1299 1 We don't have to lose this movie, this is one of the greatest I have ever seen. <PERSON>Jean Pierre Leaud</PERSON> is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue. <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> is no more on this earth, we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I'll never forget it.<br /><br />P.S.: sorry for the english...
1300 0 Why <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime (The <ORGANIZATION>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</ORGANIZATION>, The Hills Have Eyes) but is it considerably worse why <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with (Prom Night, The <ORGANIZATION>Amityville Horror</ORGANIZATION>) Much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere, character or any genuine scares at all. Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />It's a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do. It's clear <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Horror</ORGANIZATION> is dead. Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The <ORGANIZATION>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</ORGANIZATION> managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. Prom night is virtually bloodless and I'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is. Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm... the original.<br /><br />One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be. <PERSON>Donna Keppel</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style.<br /><br />When the big night finally arrives, <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn. But while <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance. An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>.<br /><br />Who will survive to see graduation day, and what will <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear? <PERSON>Scott Porter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jessica Stroup</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Dana Davis</PERSON> co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor. A plot that will probably put you off going to see this. Witch if you ask me is a good thing.<br /><br />Without much to work with, <PERSON>McCormick</PERSON> gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations. At one point, a girl backs into a floor lamp (a lamp!) and <PERSON>McCormick</PERSON> tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment. Desperate times really do call for desperate measures. There haven't been this many shots of closets since the last <ORGANIZATION>IKEA</ORGANIZATION> catalogue.<br /><br />In the era of <LOCATION>The Hills</LOCATION>, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there probably is a freaky, scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty. This is not that movie.<br /><br />My final verdict? Avoid at all cost. Nobody will like Prom Night, it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes. Considering its absolute lack of blood or frights. A night you'll be in a hurry to forget.
1301 1 A great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. Sadly, no memorable quotes here, but this one's my favorite: <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>: If you're leaving someone that you have loved, you have to say what I'm telling you now: "Farewell, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is ignoble. (didn't watch it with English subtitles)<br /><br />In my opinion, this expresses it all. There is so much tactics involved in the relationships between <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> and the others, and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> experiences. Common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of "liberated love" by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved. It does, indeed, show this in a convincing manner, but I would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth: it's not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated love.<br /><br />That said, the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching.
1302 0 I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts. I must admit, I found it pretty decent...until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems:<br /><br />1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty fit dude, makes no sound while being killed. Don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer? <br /><br />2. When the remark is made that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>," I almost screamed at the screen. When your best friend's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER, you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart.<br /><br />3. As soon as <PERSON>Nash</PERSON> asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>, boyfriend, aunt, and uncle into a car and drive far, far away, then bait the house with the <ORGANIZATION>HRT</ORGANIZATION> and police force so that the killer has no way to get out?<br /><br />I could go on. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors.<br /><br />HOWEVER.<br /><br />This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night out. If you don't consider all the goofs, it's a mediocre film.
1303 1 ** possible spoilers **<br /><br />I like this film and have no problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of me at 20, except this is even better. Like <PERSON>Veronica</PERSON> says, two chicks at one time. It brings out the horniness in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. I get into the conversations too. Even if they are utterly b.s. at times, so what? Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. The only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.<br /><br />I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by <PERSON>Veronica</PERSON>. She'd love to pull the little blonde away from <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>, but <PERSON>Veronica</PERSON> plays her all the way. She's brilliant. She gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while <PERSON>Marlene Deitrich</PERSON> sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> tonight, but I only have this refrain.<br /><br />But do they get married in the end, <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> and <PERSON>Veronica</PERSON>? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. They are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />I like the film though. It kept me entertained, it's got a nice look, and it's sexy.
1304 0 I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least <PERSON>BRITTANY</PERSON> SNOW's performance was good and some others like <PERSON>IDRIS ELBA</PERSON> were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe <PERSON>BRITTANY</PERSON> SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.
1305 1 this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it. you have a insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by <PERSON>Jean-Pierre LÃ</PERSON>©aud) who is trapped between two (no, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves. this could be the premise for a fowl movie, full of rigid, cold, uninteresting commentaries. yet director <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. being such a long movie, one cannot but burst into laughing when, after 2 hours of speaking politely, <PERSON>Jean-Pierre LÃ</PERSON>©aud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie. this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary. nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of FranÃ§oise <PERSON>Lebrun</PERSON> towards the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hours and worthing every minute.
1306 0 If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible "horror" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror clichÃ©'s you can fit in one movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you screwed up. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see "One Missed Call" again, at least that had some plot.
1307 1 "La Maman et la putain" is the beautifulest film of all time. And what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with, which is directly inspired by <PERSON>Proust</PERSON>'s "A la Recherche du temps perdu".<br /><br />Indeed, "La Maman et la putain" and "In search of lost time" apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love, which repeats itself endlessly. The first woman's name is always <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON>, and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON> : <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> is like a "whore Gilberte", beautiful like the night, whereas <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON> was pure, and "beautiful like the day". After the failure of the first love, a second love begins, but this one is like already doomed by the first one. <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> takes the place of <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON>, in <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>'s life and in the movie. She progressively eclipses her, first by time to time, <PERSON>Gilberte</PERSON>'s still coming when <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> waits for <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON>,then totally. That shows it's the same sad story repeating itself, the same "unfaithful woman", like <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> says, who appears endlessly - and unfaithful is for Proust the higher point in love, which makes it exist, but which also underlines its illusions.<br /><br />Art is what causes the passage between what's outside - the illusion of love - to what's inside, which is the truth, and is a learning of this truth. For instance, when <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> notices the strange way <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> makes is bed, he answers that he saw it in a movie, and then, that a movie, "it's made for that, to learn how to live, how to make a bed". <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> wants to live like he was in a film, he wants his life to be art. <br /><br />This conception of art comes from <ORGANIZATION>Proust</ORGANIZATION>, with whom <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> shares the same rejection of "political art" and realism in art. "La Maman et la putain" fights against a conception of art "principaly political" - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>. Like <PERSON>Proust</PERSON> says : "Art doesn't care for all this proclamations, and only exists in silence." First of all, art is introspection. And that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist. <PERSON>Proust</PERSON> writes : "I discover the illusion of realism, which is a lie". That's why "La Maman et la putain" doesn't hide its artificiality, underlines by the way the actors "say" their text : "the more you seem artificial, the higher you go", said <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> and <PERSON>Proust</PERSON> both share this idea that the artist is a "translater" of a inner truth. But, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> failed where <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> succeed. "La Maman et la putain" tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is. You can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie, which becomes saddest. You can see it in the face of <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, who looks more and more like a living-dead. You can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer, and that after a while, nothing happens outside. At the end of the movie, when you see <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> writing, and <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> asking if he's writing his life,you can guess that he's not, that even literature failed. The end of the movie shows the symbolic death of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>, who is smashes by the heaviness of reality. And in this tiny nurse's room, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> looks more like <PERSON>Albertine</PERSON> than <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON>.<br /><br />To explain this failure, we can say that <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is a Balzac's reader. In "Forme et signification", <PERSON>Jean Rousset</PERSON> explains that, in Proust's, the readers of <PERSON>Balzac</PERSON>, who are <PERSON>Swann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlus</PERSON>, are unable of any artistic creation, because they're stuck in reality, which they mistake with art. They see reality in art and "are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work, between reality and art". And that's exactly <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>. He claims for instance that he "loves a woman for parallel reasons, because she played in a <PERSON>Bresson</PERSON>'s for example". He's like <PERSON>Swann</PERSON>, who falls in love with <PERSON>Odette</PERSON> because she looks like a <PERSON>Botticelli</PERSON>'s woman.<br /><br />"Life is perhaps not my vocation". This thought is indeed by <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>, who committed suicide, even if it's said by <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>. Nevertheless, there is a difference between <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> : if <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> is absolutely <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is like a double without art, a horrible vision of the artist, which crystallizes his fears.<br /><br />By fallowing <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> at the end of the movie, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is condemned to illusions. It's death that remind me the last frames of the movie, in the face of Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud as well as in the endless pucking of <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON>. Or maybe it is already hell that describes the end, like in <PERSON>Sarte</PERSON>'s "Huit-Clot", and absolutely not like in the final liberation of "Le Temps retrouvÃ©". If <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> had read <ORGANIZATION>Proust</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> could never have finish the book , always perturbed by life and <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafÃ©s. "La Maman et la Putain" is like a inverse double of "In search of lost times", which tells how <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> doesn't become an artist, whereas "A la Recherche du temps perdu" tells how <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON> becomes a writer (<PERSON>Genette</PERSON>).<br /><br />If, like <PERSON>Baudelaire</PERSON> says, an artiste tells "reality at the light of his dream", it is his nightmare that <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> tells us in "La Maman et la putain".
1308 0 "Prom Night" is a title-only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred <PERSON>Jamie Lee Curtis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leslie Nielsen</PERSON>. This movie takes place in an <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> town, where <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>) is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years. She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives. Little does anyone know, a man from <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>'s past, who has haunted her for years, is also at the prom... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the original "Prom Night", so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but I have to admit I was quite disappointed. "Prom Night" suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have, and that is predictability. There are absolutely no surprises here, and I felt I had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times, often better, before. What does this equate to for the audience? Boredom. Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the pre-teen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen. The plot is simplistic, but the entire script is void of any type of surprise, twist, atmosphere, or anything, and this really, really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into. It all just seemed very bland.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a PG-13 slasher movie as well, and I understand what they are saying, but I don't think it's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore. Take <PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON>'s "Halloween" for example - little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie. You don't need gore to make a film scary, but even had "Prom Night" been gratuitously violent (which it is not, it is very tame), it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with. The tension and suspense here is mild at best, and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99% of the time. Our characters aren't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them, and their by-the-numbers demises are routine and careless.<br /><br />I will point out a few things I did like about this movie, though, because it wasn't completely useless - the cinematography is really nice, and everything was very well-filmed and fairly stylish. Among the "jump" scares (that are for the most part very predictable), there were a few that were kind of clever. The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be. As for the acting, it's mediocre at best. <PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON> plays the lead decently, but really the rest of the cast doesn't show off much talent. <PERSON>Johnathan Schaech</PERSON> plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he isn't that impressive. However, I did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical 'masked-stalker' type killer we see a lot. As far as the ending goes, the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit's end and it was very anti-climactic.<br /><br />Overall, "Prom Night" was a disappointment. Everything was very by-the-numbers, routine, and predictable, which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie. There were a few neat moments, but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere, and had little plot development, nor believable characters. I'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video, or rent the original instead, because there are absolutely no surprises here. Some may find a little entertainment in it, but it was far too predictable for my tastes. I expected better, and left the theater very disappointed. 3/10.
1309 1 In what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual "revolution" (purposefully I use quotations for that word), <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> wrote and directed The Mother and the Whore as a poetic, damning critique of those who can't seem to get enough love. If there is a message to this film- and I'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this Ben-Hur length feature has to offer- it's that in order to love, honestly, there has to be some level of happiness, of real truth. Is it possible to have two lovers? Some can try, but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want, or feel they can even express to say what they want? <br /><br />What is the truth in the relationships that <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jean-Pierre Leaud</PERSON>) has with the women around him? He's a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual, not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman, <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Bernadette Lafont</PERSON>) slightly older than him and is usually, if not always, his lover, his last possible love-of-his-life left him, and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street, <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> (FranÃ§oise <PERSON>Lebrun</PERSON>), who perhaps reminds him of her. Soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film, where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures. At first we think it might be all about what will happen to <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, but we're mistaken. The women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around, talking on and on, for something to sink in.<br /><br />We're told that part of the sexual revolution, in theory if not entirely in practice (perhaps it was, I can't say having not been alive in the period to see it first-hand), was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions. But <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>'s point, if not entirely message, is that it's practically impossible to have it both ways: you can't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with "f***ing", as the characters refer over and over again. <br /><br />The Mother and the Whore's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity, the lack of monogamy, while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you've ever seen in a movie. At the same time we see a character like <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past, <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> makes it so that the film itself isn't pretentious- though it could appear to be- but that it's about pretentiousness, what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws, what they need to use when they're ultimately alone in the morning. <br /><br />If you thought films like Before Sunrise/Sunset were talky relationship flicks, you haven't met this. But as <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> revels in the dialogs these characters have, sometimes trivial, or 'deep', or sexual, or frank, or occasionally extremely (or in a subdued manner) emotional, it's never, ever uninteresting or boring. On the contrary, for those who can't get enough of a *good* talky film, it's exceptional. While his style doesn't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand, <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>'s new-wave touch is with the characters, and then reverberating on them.<br /><br />This is realism with a spike of attitude, with things at time scathing and sarcastic, crude and without shame in expression. All three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can't ever perceive them as 'faking' an emotion or going at all into melodrama. It's almost TOO good in naturalistic/realism terms, but for <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>'s material there is no other way around it. Luckily <PERSON>Leaud</PERSON> delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period, and both ladies, particularly <PERSON>Labrun</PERSON> as the "whore" <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> (a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film's climax of sorts in one unbroken shot). And, as another touch, every so often, the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought, of a character sitting by themselves, listening to a record, and in contemplation or quiet agony. This is probably the biggest influence on <PERSON>Jim Jarmusch</PERSON>, who dedicated his film Broken Flowers to <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely (and lovingly) in approach from the late Parisian.<br /><br />Sad to say, before I saw <PERSON>Broken Flowers</PERSON>, I never heard of <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> or this film, and procuring it has become quite a challenge (not available on <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> DVD, and on VHS so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries). Not a minute of that time was wasted; the Mother and the Whore is truly beautiful work, one of the best of French relationship dramas, maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid I've seen from the country in general. It's complex, it's sweet, it's cold, it's absorbing, and it's very long, perhaps too long. It's also satisfying on the kind of level that I'd compare to Scenes from a Marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film's release.
1310 0 I went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie I couldn't have been more let down. Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around. Sadly, Prom Night is about on the same quality level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.<br /><br />From beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. The laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key "thrilling" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie. Which in retrospect, I wish I had done. Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. Needless to say It didn't. The "horror" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the camera work. The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /><br />This movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed.
1311 1 Unfortunately, <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> (1938-1981) belongs like so many once leading French film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international DVDs. Since we have a good old-fashioned video-store in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, I had the chance to watch this 3 1/2-hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten seconds.<br /><br />Since we speak here about one of the most discussed (and most controversially discussed) movies of all times, let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs, originally typical for the early "Nouvelle Vague" of a <PERSON>Jacques Rivette</PERSON> or <PERSON>Alain Resnais</PERSON> appear almost ridiculous in this movie. The dialogs are basically monologues, mainly the longest ones spoken by <PERSON>Jean-Pierre LÃ</PERSON>©aud. The most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero. LÃ©aud, or his character, <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak. Therefore, one can hardly speak about communication in this movie. It is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas, but the type of man <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> exists to all times, we find him already in <ORGANIZATION>Petron</ORGANIZATION>'s "Satiricon", which work has actually great resemblance with "The Mother and the Whore".<br /><br /><PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> does not only nothing, but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting, at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is. He mocks at the people who run to work at 7 c'clock in the morning, when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives. He is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between <PERSON>Nietzsche</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernanos</PERSON>. Especially <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> who is shown quickly in the French intellectual cafÃ© "Aux Deux Magots", where <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, too, is sitting all day, must serve as excuse for the life-style of <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> and his colleagues, because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea. However, the intellectual speeches of <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual, and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books.<br /><br />It is true: This movie demands an extremely broad European knowledge, especially the connoisseurship of French existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement, but if you have this knowledge, than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the TV and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time.
1312 0 Note: I couldn't force myself to actually write up a constructive review of Prom Night. It just can't be done. Instead, I went through what I thought about while watching the movie.<br /><br />Things that I thought about while watching Prom Night: <br /><br />-I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it. Of course, when I say "elaborate deaths", I mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach. Didn't the whole "it's just a dream" thing get ruined by <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>? Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death.<br /><br />-The film is only ten minutes into and I can already count the horror clichÃ©s on two hands. Not a good sign.<br /><br />-Even after just meeting the protagonist's boyfriend, I'm convinced he will die. Anybody want to place bets? <br /><br />-The killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character, <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>. (By the way, does anybody think that "<PERSON>Donna</PERSON>" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film?) He spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> celebrating her high school prom. While there is no accounting for taste, I seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>.<br /><br />-High schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn't keep track of the students. Apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please. I suppose if this plot point wasn't in place, the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom. I suppose the trade-off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything. I've already played "count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only in the 20 minute mark. How else will I entertain myself? <br /><br />-Note to self: Don't forget milk and bread on the way home.<br /><br />-Dear screenwriter: You've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year.<br /><br />-The 1980 version of this film wasn't that good but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. It had <PERSON>Jamie Lee Curtis</PERSON> in one of her many post-Halloween horror flicks and it did have a little "twist" at the end. I miss <PERSON>Jamie Lee</PERSON>. I wish she'd act more.<br /><br />-Apparently at prom there isn't much dancing going on. Instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college. I hear all these colleges being brought up by name, and I can't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in.<br /><br />-The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes. That's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room, there is no trace of a struggle. (On another side note: This is a very lazy killer. <PERSON>Michael Myers</PERSON> went hunting after his victims. Just saying.)<br /><br />-It's official: the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer. What triggered it? Was it whenever <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building? Was it her constant dreams, and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee? Or was it <PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>'s unconvincing performance? I'll have to say it was all of the above.<br /><br />-Okay, who had "he dies off screen in the third act"? You win the pot.<br /><br />-Finally, the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says "<PERSON>Donna</PERSON> wasn't too smart." That's the understatement of the week. Kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience.<br /><br />-I can't wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review.<br /><br />-I can't recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. This is as lazy of a horror film as any, and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for theater patrons, alcohol isn't served.<br /><br />Rating: * out of ****
1313 1 Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceedingly hard on <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>. Neither <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> or <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>, he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? i don't think so. Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON>'s position, in an urban area can ask for. I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
1314 0 PROM NIGHT (2008)<br /><br />directed by: <PERSON>Nelson McCormick</PERSON><br /><br />starring: <PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>, <PERSON>Scott Porter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jessica Stroup</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Dana Davis</PERSON><br /><br />plot: Three years ago, <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (<PERSON>Jonathan Schaech</PERSON>) who has a bit of a crush on her. Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. <br /><br />pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.<br /><br />An example:<br /><br />Everyone decides not to tell <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL<br /><br />cons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.<br /><br />First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jessica Stroup</PERSON>) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /><br />And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.<br /><br />I also hated the characters. There was <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>'s unrealistically sensitive boyfriend <PERSON>Bobby</PERSON> (<PERSON>Scott Porter</PERSON>) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>'s annoying friends <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> (<PERSON>Stroup</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> (<PERSON>Dana Davis</PERSON>), and the token mean girl <PERSON>Chrissy</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brianne Davis</PERSON>). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And don't get me started on <PERSON>Ronnie</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Collins Pennie</ORGANIZATION>) and the DJ (<PERSON>Jay Phillips</PERSON>) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.<br /><br />Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.
1315 1 La Maman et la Putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. True, the actors don't "act" ... True, they talk a lot... But what they talk about is just what makes life worth living... or dying. The very long monologue spoken by FranÃ§oise <PERSON>Lebrun</PERSON> is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood, manhood and love. Not easy to translate accurately, though. This movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, <PERSON>Jean Pierre LÃ</PERSON>©aud is one of the greatest French actors.
1316 0 I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. I never go by other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? I swear, I'm amazed there weren't any GROUP HUG ^-^ moments.<br /><br />I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English. The clichÃ©d, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gonna happen.<br /><br />And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, "I have to get my mom's shawl!!!" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mom's shawl (that didn't match the dress By the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they take her BACK to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God.<br /><br />My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not just the, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was the, "HE stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "It's the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!" moments. Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable. <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> movies aren't even this predictable.<br /><br />I'm gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn't buy it for $15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would've been better if only one thing would've happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. Oh, how lovely that would've been.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money. Go see a GOOD movie.
1317 1 It is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character, that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the very greatest films of all time.<br /><br />The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see <PERSON>Jacques Rivette</PERSON>'s fantastic CÃ©line and Julie Go Boating, which was made around the same time). It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.<br /><br />It involves a supposedly liberated mÃ©nage-Ã -trois between <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> (played by <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Leaud</PERSON>), <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Bernadette Lafont</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> (<PERSON>Francoise Lebrun</PERSON>). Yet <PERSON>Alexandre</PERSON> is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. The women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.<br /><br />The film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Leaud</PERSON> was one of the key actors of the New Wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by <PERSON>Francois Truffaut</PERSON> as a rebellious teenager. Director <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but he should be.<br /><br />There is no improvisation (unlike in <PERSON>John Cassavetes</PERSON>'s similar films made in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is resonant with <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>'s personal experiences. For example, <PERSON>Francoise Lebrun</PERSON> was a former lover of <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON>. <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> was based on, did too. The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by <PERSON>Veronika</PERSON> delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This mesmerising, personal, and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.
1318 0 This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot I rented the film) is discouraging also.<br /><br />Obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. HMM--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.<br /><br />There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired. Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash.
1319 1 One of the last classics of the French New Wave. For direction, cineaste <PERSON>Jean Eustache</PERSON> drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema; for story, <PERSON>Eustache</PERSON> drew on the torments of his own complicated love life. So many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant; self indulgently overlong; occasionally hilarious; emotionally draining...etc. etc. In my mind, whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths. Every film student, writer, or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts, no music video overstyling, no soap opera-like plot twists, and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie. Everything is to be admired: the writing (concise, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, is perfect in their respective roles), and, simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film) make this film unforgettable. This is undoubtedly a film that stays with you.
1320 0 Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clichÃ© on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. <br /><br />We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. <br /><br />On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.<br /><br />Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? <br /><br />Closets, that's what. <br /><br />Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to <LOCATION>Narnia</LOCATION>, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called "CLOSET", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> and Ebert - something to the extent of: "what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"
1321 1 9/10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not that scary. But it sure is fun.<br /><br />The Crypt Keeper (<PERSON>John Kassir</PERSON>) tales a tale of holiday FEAR, giving us all Christmas Goose... GosseBUMPS That is. Bwahahahahha. You should really be careful what you AXE <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> for. Have a Scary Christmas and a Happy New Fear. Okay I'll stop.<br /><br />Okay, so in the story, a greedy wife (Best screamer in the world, <PERSON>Mary Ellen Trainor</PERSON>) kills her husband (<ORGANIZATION>Marshall Bell</ORGANIZATION>, the coach who gets towel whipped to death in ANOES 2) for the money. BUT, her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> suit (<PERSON>Larry</PERSON> "Dr. Giggles" <PERSON>Drake</PERSON>) comes her way.<br /><br />If you look it up on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing). But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do.
1322 0 Okay. So I just got back. Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. I didn't.<br /><br />It's not just the fact that every horror clichÃ© imaginable is in this. And it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare (walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing I was surprised about: there was more blood than I thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.<br /><br />The film starts off with <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> being dropped off by <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>'s mom at her house. She comes in.. goes upstairs. Camera pans to her father dead on the couch. Spooky. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? He didn't have a spot of blood on him). Killer comes in, <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> hides under bed, mom dies. She runs outside screaming for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to therapy session. This confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. Filler dialogue ensues.<br /><br />THey cut to the chase pretty quick. Few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there). More filler ensues.<br /><br />I'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because I don't want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already. But on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting. People in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience I've never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen. The only death involving any blood was <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>'s, and that was pretty scarce. Her throat is slashed, blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing. The only other blood was on <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> when we see her body. Apparently, <PERSON>Fenton</PERSON> decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clichÃ©d I've ever seen. Let's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). Mandatory backing-up-into-killer. Check. There's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene, but you've all seen that. Oh, you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). And, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene. Shall I go on? I could.<br /><br />For anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? "Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only likable character - <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. "Oh, I just realized the psycho-teacher is here! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? Guess I'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!" Ugh. By the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone felt any remorse for was <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>'s boyfriend (I can't even remember his name- is that bad?), and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clichÃ©d film.<br /><br />There were SOME positives- the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well-shot. But that's about it.<br /><br />I'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few), and <PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>.<br /><br />Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.
1323 1 Ho, ho, homicidal maniac! This spirited tour-de-force adaptation of a great <ORGANIZATION>EC Comics</ORGANIZATION> horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made. Director <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> ("Back to the Future") <PERSON>Zemeckis</PERSON> makes the most out of a witty script by <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> ("Night of the Creeps," "The Monster Squad") <PERSON>Dekker</PERSON> which centers on a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by <PERSON>Mary Ellen Trainor</PERSON>, who was married to <PERSON>Zemeckis</PERSON> when she starred in this episode) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband (a nice cameo by <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Bell</ORGANIZATION>) on Christmas Eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire-poker. Complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly <PERSON>Kris Kringle</PERSON> escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay <PERSON>Trainor</PERSON> a decidedly unfriendly visit. <PERSON>Alan Silvestri</PERSON>'s spooky, stirring score and <PERSON>Dean Cundey</PERSON>'s typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun. And <PERSON>Larry Drake</PERSON> (the sweet gentle giant <PERSON>Benny</PERSON> on "L.A. Law"!), with his creepy hiccuping guffaw, a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes, and a leering, truly wicked grin, makes for a sensational sanguinary Saint <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>.
1324 0 and rent a GOOD horror movie. It's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichÃ©d and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like "Scream" and "Scary Movie".<br /><br />In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written. Stupid "we're going to the prom" junk. I wanted to claw my ears off. Honestly, "The Hills" has better dialog.<br /><br />There really was no need to make this movie. Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking "Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?" <br /><br />All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) <br /><br />The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). The people are like mentally disabled sheep.<br /><br />By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (So boo hoo for you!) <br /><br />None of the killings is the least bit interesting. Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.<br /><br />The only clichÃ© missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. "Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer -- AIIEEEE!" <br /><br />And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore.<br /><br />The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.<br /><br />(Oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) <br /><br />So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
1325 1 An axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is just wonderful. I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is just very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
1326 0 Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums. You think you might go see the <PERSON>Sarah Marshall</PERSON> movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The <ORGANIZATION>Bank Job</ORGANIZATION>, In <LOCATION>Bruges</LOCATION>, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the <ORGANIZATION>Bank Job</ORGANIZATION> (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and In <LOCATION>Bruges</LOCATION> (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't fancy watching <PERSON>Clooney</PERSON> or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. It would be money better spent.<br /><br />It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen (<PERSON>Ben Affleck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hayden Christansan</PERSON> (I hate his acting so much I don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) <br /><br />So in summary 'not good'
1327 1 I have watched this episode more often than any other <ORGANIZATION>TFTC</ORGANIZATION> episode, it is that enjoyable. And it is quite scary, but all in good, ghoulish fun. A woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment. <PERSON>Mary Traynor</PERSON>, who I seem to remember from SNL or some other TV comedy skit show, is the evil wife, and <PERSON>Larry Drake</PERSON> plays the lunatic in the dingy <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> outfit. I had forgotten <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> was played by <PERSON>Drake</PERSON> over the years. His <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times. You can probably guess how <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> finally gets into the house. The episode is played for laughs, but it also can be pretty intense at times.
1328 0 I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichÃ©d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichÃ©s are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.
1329 1 Tales from the Crypt: And All Through the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> starts on Christmas Eve as <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mary Ellen Trainor</PERSON>) kills her husband <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marshall Bell</PERSON>), she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac (<PERSON>Larry Drake</PERSON>) dressed as <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clause</ORGANIZATION> has escaped from a local mental asylum & has already killed several women with <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> next on his list but she has other ideas & tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage...<br /><br />This Tales from the Crypt story was episode 2 from season 1, directed by the one of the show's regular executive producers <PERSON>Robert Zemeckis</PERSON> And All Through the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is a decent enough watch. The script by <PERSON>Fred Dekker</PERSON> was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'The Vault of Horror' & was originally adapted to film as one episode from the Britsih horror anthology film Tales from the Crypt (1972) which starred <PERSON>Joan Collins</PERSON> as the murderous wife character here played by <PERSON>Ellen Trainor</PERSON>. This particular version is good enough but doesn't do anything different or special & is a bit too linear & predictable to be considered a classic. At only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace, the story is just about macabre enough & it generally provides decent entertainment & I quite liked the downbeat ending. This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper (<PERSON>John Kassir</PERSON>) segments complete with the usual puns.<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Zemeckis</PERSON> does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of Christmas influence as well. There's not much gore here, someone has a poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic. The acting by a small cast is pretty good.<br /><br />And All Through the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> isn't the best tale from the crypt but it's a decent one all the same, worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this?
1330 0 In <LOCATION>Bridgeport</LOCATION>, the deranged high school teacher <PERSON>Richard Fenton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Johnathon Schaech</PERSON>) is obsessed by the teenager student <PERSON>Donna Keppel</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend <PERSON>Bobby</PERSON> (<PERSON>Scott Porter</PERSON>) and two couples of friends to the <LOCATION>Pacific Grad Hotel</LOCATION> for the party. But the psychopath <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing <PERSON>Donna</PERSON>, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.<br /><br />The forgettable slash "Prom Night" is a collection of clichÃ©s with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of <PERSON>Johnathon Schaech</PERSON> in the role of an insane killer. The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "A Morte Convida Para DanÃ§ar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
1331 1 "And All Through the House" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> I saw this episode and I was buried to the Crypt right then and forever! I had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> I again had fearful pleasure. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. "And All Through the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! Well anyway you have <PERSON>Mary Ellen Trainor</PERSON>(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! Well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured <PERSON>Joan Collins</PERSON>, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!
1332 0 I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that, my girl friend turned to me and said "we have to go see this movie"...enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall. I would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development.<br /><br />The plot is just...well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, That's brilliant! hmmm The acting was what you expect in a Australian soap opera hopeless, that main character the <PERSON>Blondie</PERSON> god dam she annoyed me. her longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression.<br /><br />Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this, and if your like me and don't have a choice well then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine. Can't believe this film got made!
1333 1 Episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love, betrayal,...and a homicidal, escaped lunatic dressed as Father Christmas.<br /><br />A woman (<PERSON>Mary Ellen-Trainor</PERSON>)has just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged, <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Clause suit wearing psychopath (<PERSON>Larry Drake</PERSON>, perfectly over the top) threatens her life...as well as her precious young daughters.<br /><br />This episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program. By the way,this particular reviewer watches it every Christmas on routine. Most notable for it's escalating suspense and narrative twists, And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt's best.
1334 0 When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.<br /><br /><PERSON>Donna</PERSON>'s family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are. <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG-13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.<br /><br />2/10
1335 1 Although I've long been a fan of <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>, I hadn't watched any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise.<br /><br /><PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> plays <PERSON>David</PERSON>, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another Aborigine. For <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. But <PERSON>David</PERSON> believes there's a mystery underneath the murder, linked to tribal rituals. As his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too.<br /><br />To reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting.<br /><br />There are many elements that make this a fascinating movie: <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s acting, for instance; but also the performances by <PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON>, who plays a young aborigine who introduces <PERSON>David</PERSON> into tribal mysteries; and <PERSON>Nandjiwarra Amagula</PERSON>, who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie.<br /><br />But there's also the way <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> suggests the supernatural in the movie. <PERSON>David</PERSON> has dreams that warn him of the future. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is undergoing awful weather, with storms, hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution. But it's also related to the case <PERSON>David</PERSON> is defending. How it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie. Out of little events <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.<br /><br /><PERSON>Charles Wain</PERSON>'s score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. The photography is also quite good. <PERSON>Russell Boyd</PERSON>, <PERSON>Weir</PERSON>'s longtime DP who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mystery.<br /><br />I also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines, it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions, like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too clever to be that simplistic.<br /><br />Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who don't mind some strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
1336 0 So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.<br /><br />I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.<br /><br />Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD.
1337 1 I just watched "The Last Wave" in my school's fine arts library. It's intriguing, like all <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>'s stuff, but it's not always as attention-holding as I would have liked. I found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the film's director <PERSON>Weir</PERSON>)but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I got a little bored in spots.<br /><br />The plot surrounds an Aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an Aborigone group he is defending.<br /><br />It starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout (most notably the bizarre, "belching" sound design)and strong direction; but it just didn't entertain me like <PERSON>Weir</PERSON>'s later films do. I might just need to watch it again though.<br /><br />Good film about obsession and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery that exists between the whites and the Aboriginies offers some very severe consequences.<br /><br />God bless <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>, though. For him alone this film is worth watching ... very organic director. Like an Aussie response <PERSON>Malick</PERSON>! I'd give it a 7 because it's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments.
1338 0 I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw "Semi-Pro" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???
1339 1 You know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky. In fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller, and only lawyer <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> has the answer. But he's too much the European rationalist, I gather, to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams.<br /><br />Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>. Already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975). Here it's the arcane world of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites. Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason. Yuppie lawyer <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> is supposed to defend them in a white man's court. But the more he looks into things, the more mysterious things get, and the more interested a strange old Aboriginal man gets in him. And then there're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times.<br /><br />Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout. One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s wife and little daughters. Audiences can readily identify with them. And when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework, the normalcy begins to buckle, and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide. <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> underplays throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does. After all, it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key (I believe) to the riddle, yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation. <br /><br />Of course, the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now, thirty years later. In the film, the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus, but the subject itself remains a telling one. One way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene. A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family, leaving them in the historical dust. The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells. Yet, it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave. Perhaps there's something about past and future to think about here.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you.
1340 0 Prom Night is about a girl named <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. <br /><br />Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.<br /><br />The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /><br />If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.<br /><br />1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would).
1341 1 THE LAST WAVE is never going to win over the mainstream audience. It is a slow-moving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it. An Australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own. All sorts of portents and omens soon pop up, as the man's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man's court, and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. It looks like the end of the world may be at hand, and he and the aborigines may know this but no one else does. <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> as the lawyer is at his peak here. <PERSON>David Guptil</PERSON>, a familiar face from several other Australian flicks and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial. THE LAST WAVE is simply not for everyone, anymore than is MAGNOLIA (both happen to have strange things falling from the sky). Check it out on a slow Saturday night.
1342 0 Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that NOBODY ever "really" gets killed (at least not on screen) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.<br /><br />You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time.<br /><br />Honestly, I have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again! <br /><br />It is one thing to rent a "bad" movie at blockbuster from the <ORGANIZATION>Weinsteins</ORGANIZATION>, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.<br /><br />Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-imagining. It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be "funny" like others on IMDb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring.<br /><br />Here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on <PERSON>Brittany Snow</PERSON>'s head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that <PERSON>Jonathan Schaech</PERSON> MUST be having some sexual affair with <PERSON>J.S. Cardone</PERSON> of "The Forsaken" to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste you're money like I did. The "original" sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for <PERSON>Jamie Lee Curtis</PERSON> fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what I say).
1343 1 I remember seeing this when it was released, in a theater in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, and not expecting much. I mean -- an Australian movie? But it finally got to me. Here's a scene. <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in <LOCATION>Sidney</LOCATION>, facing an Australian aborigine elder named <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>: "You were outside my house last night. You frightened my wife. Who are you?" And <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> at a deliberate pace replies, "Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?. . . . Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man? . . . . Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?" It's a stunning scene, shot all in close ups, with <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>'s black, broad-nosed, bearded visage.<br /><br />The two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable, almost unspeakable, mysteries of <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>'s world.<br /><br />I don't think I'll go on much about the plot. It's kind of an apocalyptic tale. But I must say, whoever did the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems should get an A plus. They've got everything in here, from pointing the bone to the dream time, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real. It's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects. <PERSON>Charly</PERSON>'s world simply begins to intrude into <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s dreams, for reasons never made entirely clear.<br /><br />If there's a problem with the script, that's it. Nothing is ever made entirely clear. Does <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>, who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines, die in the last wave? Do the aborigines? Does the entirety of <PERSON>Sidney</PERSON>? The basic premise is a little hard to accept too, though granted that this is a fantasy. The aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that Americans bestow on American Indians, whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying -- more elegant and beautiful, if you like -- mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. The mysticism of <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in <PERSON>Cecil B. DeMille</PERSON>'s "The Ten Commandments," but they're brothers under the skin.<br /><br />But I don't care about that. Taken as a film, this one is pretty good, and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director, <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>, and the Australian film industry. This was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes, some of them raucous, like "Mad Max," and some subtle and dramatic, like "<LOCATION>Lantana</LOCATION>." I like <PERSON>Weir</PERSON>'s stuff, which resembles <PERSON>Nicholas Roeg</PERSON>'s in being pregnant with subliminal dread. Try "Picnic at Hanging Rock" for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood.
1344 0 Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one. This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. It's dramatic Â… it's sappy Â… it's immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.<br /><br />Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about <PERSON>Matthew McConaughey</PERSON> coming at you with a knife. You'd probably go Â… "OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa." Not scary even for a second, so the director throws <PERSON>Schaech</PERSON> into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING). I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.<br /><br />As if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.<br /><br />With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of "Silver Spoons", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend Â… at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! A complete waste of my time and yours. I bit the bullet to get you this review. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!!
1345 1 This motion picture has a steady, haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time.<br /><br />Beyond that, the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy, cautious and somber tone.<br /><br /><PERSON>Weir</PERSON>'s story is enhanced by using aboriginals, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous.<br /><br />Although they are unrelated in story as well as genre, this maintained the same feeling within me as <PERSON>Ursula Le Guin</PERSON>'s "Lathe of Heaven" (1980). <br /><br />"The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember, "hacking and slicing" doesn't make a film a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all.
1346 0 ...let me count the ways.<br /><br />1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every clichÃ© in the slasher handbook.<br /><br />2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.<br /><br />3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.<br /><br />4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.<br /><br />5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.<br /><br />6. A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.<br /><br />7. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).<br /><br />8. A script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. <br /><br />9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).<br /><br />10. A completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.<br /><br />It's a no-brainer horror fans, save your money.<br /><br />BOMB out of ****
1347 1 Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called " The Last Wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. <PERSON>David Burton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON>) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named <PERSON>Chris Lee</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON>), <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****
1348 0 I have been known to fall asleep during films, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot. However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish. The plot development was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why. I admit, I may have missed part of the film, but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else. I cant recommend this film at all.
1349 1 While to most people watching the movie, this will be of little interest, but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many ways.<br /><br />From The Golem to The Craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry. The majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly (for example "Witchboard", a true piece of utter garbage in every way) either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians (cf "Warlock"). More frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context (in the various Revelations-oriented movies, the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new-age style practice). Rarely, a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic, or ... just not quite right.<br /><br />I watched this movie again after many years tonight. I had seen it before on VHS; it is a dark, moody piece, and after watching it on DVD, I would say if you have any intention to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, don't watch it on VHS.<br /><br />The darkness and moodiness are overpowering in VHS but in DVD the movie takes on a very different tone. I think <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style, but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of VHS this goes over the edge. DVD brings the movie to life again and I saw it differently.<br /><br />Anyway, seeing it as if for the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie. It's difficult to go into all the reasons why, I don't care to take the time to do so.<br /><br />For anybody who's curious, anyway, if you want to see what it is like in real life, this movie is just very right on countless levels.<br /><br />And for anybody who isn't, you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point.
1350 0 City girl <PERSON>Meg Tilly</PERSON> receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to her family's rural digs, only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways? Radiation thriller, with barely a nod to ecology, has small town residents going berserk, which (laughably) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and <PERSON>Tim Matheson</PERSON> receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench. The picture is too silly for words, wasting <PERSON>Tilly</PERSON>'s wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of. Some of the cinematography by <PERSON>Thomas Del Ruth</PERSON> is good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage), though he is let down by the scrappy editing--and a fairly bathetic finale. Simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve. *1/2 from ****
1351 1 <PERSON>David Burton</PERSON>(<PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON>, quite good)is a lawyer, more adept at handling corporate taxation(..and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness), who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named <PERSON>Billy</PERSON>..we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>(<PERSON>Nandjiwarra Amagula</PERSON>)uses a "death bone" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, revolving around <PERSON>David</PERSON>, bizarre weather patterns effect <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock-sized hail during bright blue skies(with no sights of clouds, such as the one that hits a school in central <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>), not to mention, a "deformed" rainbow which is split(!)into groups. As <PERSON>David</PERSON> pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize. One aboriginal named <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>(<PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON>)appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial! He finds that it's quite possible, after some strange meetings with <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> and conversations with <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, that he very well might be linked to a spirit named <PERSON>Mulkurul</PERSON> and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come.<br /><br />Absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. With <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON> in charge, the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization, but the film's most compelling angle is certainly <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> countlessly, at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't commit, and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later.
1352 0 I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, it was the remake of High Sierra with <PERSON>Bogart</PERSON>, two, the Bogart part was played by <PERSON>Jack Palance</PERSON>, whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility, as in The Big Knife.<br /><br />But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as <ORGANIZATION>Hig Sierra</ORGANIZATION>; only here, the actors don't care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking. <PERSON>Jack Palance</PERSON> is getting bored looking at <ORGANIZATION>Shelley Winters</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Shelley Winters</PERSON> is asking herself what she's doing in this film. I don't even want to compare her to <PERSON>Ida Lupino</PERSON> in the same role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! They surely could have come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot <PERSON>High Sierra</PERSON>, but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film.<br /><br />It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it one more time...
1353 1 'The Last Wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. It's not merely a disaster film, not simply an exploration into Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer/Director <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON> manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier, that you will continue to remember years later.<br /><br />When lawyer <PERSON>David Burton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>) is called to defend <PERSON>Chris Lee</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gulpilil</PERSON>) over the death of an Aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible, he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>, but making sense of what he hears when it does come. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with ramifications more disastrous than <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> could ever have imagined.<br /><br />No doubt the reason why 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery. We are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves. In 'The Last Wave', we can piece everything together by the end of the film. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how much of it we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities.<br /><br />On the production side, <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> uses his budget to great effect, progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rain, to good use of sound. The incidental music is unobtrusive, never trying to be grandiose. <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery. <PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON> excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but afraid because he already knows the ending.<br /><br />Put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of why <PERSON>David Weir</PERSON> is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on. Strongly recommended.
1354 0 I shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing, preachy cinematic trash. Larded with enough Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new-age shop, <PERSON>Starlight</PERSON> makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal-fondling idiot.<br /><br />The plot? Alien <PERSON>Rae Dawn Chong</PERSON> arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s impending environmental collapse. But first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a <LOCATION>Castro</LOCATION> street bar. Fortunately, they've got mystical grandpa <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON> along to help (who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings, as well he ought to be) along with buckets of cheap F/X and reams of pointlessly swelling music.<br /><br />Sure, the clunky script helps to obscure the film's trite plot and staggering pace, but that's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg. Everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science.
1355 1 ****SPOILER ALERT**** All throughout <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. It's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer <PERSON>David Burton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON>,got involved in a case, as a defense attorney, involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> bar. <br /><br />Having five fellow aborigines arrested for <PERSON>Billy Cormans</PERSON>,<PERSON>Athol Compton</PERSON>, death it's determined by the police coroner that <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. Yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder.<br /><br /><PERSON>David</PERSON> defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> to themselves and take what's coming to them from the court. One of the defendants <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Gulpili</PERSON>, begin to somehow invades <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s dreams as if he want's to tell him what was really behind <PERSON>Billy</PERSON>'s death.<br /><br /><PERSON>David</PERSON> at first not taking his dreams of <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse. <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> confirms <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that <PERSON>David</PERSON> saw <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> have in his dreams. Later meeting <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> and, what turns out to be an aborigine shaman, <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Nandjiwarna Amagula</PERSON>) who came to his house that evening <PERSON>David</PERSON> is told that he, like <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>, has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather. Those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent. The earth,<PERSON>Chris</PERSON> tells <PERSON>David</PERSON>, is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it's place.<br /><br /><PERSON>David</PERSON> is confused about what both <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen. <PERSON>David</PERSON> want's to know if it's all aborigine folklore or there's some scientific facts, or logic, behind their end of world-like revelations.<br /><br />By now it's obvious that both <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. That alone can get <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> off, as well as his four friends, for the murder of <PERSON>Billy</PERSON>. Since the Australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines, leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves. Still <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> refuses to admit he's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in <PERSON>Billy</PERSON>'s death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days.<br /><br /><PERSON>David</PERSON> now determined to find out what was the reason for <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' silence, and why <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> had to die, is taken by <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> to the scene of the crime. It's there that <PERSON>David</PERSON> finds out that <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> betrayed <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' tribe members by going there with <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> not being a member of <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>'s aborigine tribe. It's also revealed to <PERSON>David</PERSON> that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the Austrailan aborigines as both <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> and his step-father Rev. <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>,<PERSON>David Parslow</PERSON>, told him. <br /><br />The stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that <PERSON>David</PERSON>'s been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions. It comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> into the Australian coast city of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and then submerges the entire continent.
1356 0 All I can really say is that I'm glad that I was knitting socks while watching the movie, or I would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and I laughing out loud. I highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of MST3K.
1357 1 <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>'s first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. <PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON> plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide <PERSON>Chamberlin</PERSON> thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.
1358 0 This has an interesting, albeit somewhat fanciful sci-fi plot, but it's wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects. <PERSON>Rae Dawn Chong</PERSON> is appealing, despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent.
1359 1 This supernatural <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON> thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen. <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> does his best performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young <PERSON>Aborigins</PERSON> accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, and not least about himself. <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will drown the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. <PERSON>Olivia Hamnett</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON> are solid in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>, the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>, the master of visually stunning dramas.
1360 0 I finally caught up to "Starlight" last night on television and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>'s eyes!), the atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the mismatched use of stock footage, or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production. This truly is a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be thankful for that. I nominate <PERSON>Jonathon Kay</PERSON> as the true heir to <PERSON>Ed Wood</PERSON>!
1361 1 "The Last Wave" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wipes out everything.<br /><br /><PERSON>David Burton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON>) is a <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> lawyer hired to defend some Aborigines accused of murder. Around this time, there has been unusually heavy rainfall in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. While defending the Aborigines, <PERSON>David</PERSON> learns the last wave theory, and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology.<br /><br />The movie's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind. <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON> created a perplexing, but thought-provoking, movie. Aboriginal actor <PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON> (whom you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants.<br /><br />If you get a chance, watch the "making of" feature on the DVD. <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON> explains some of the film's undertones, some of which relate to <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON>'s background.
1362 0 This review may contain some SPOILERS.<br /><br />Just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes <PERSON>Rae Dawn Chong</PERSON> as a space vixen and <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON> as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight,' a film that should only be viewed for laughs.<br /><br /><PERSON>Chong</PERSON> is an alien sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to seek out the only remaining half-breed, part man and part alien. Apparently, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is in dire straits. Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. Don't ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans. You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! Anyway, the half-breed turns out to be <PERSON>Billy Wirth</PERSON>, a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line, despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON>. Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic <PERSON>Carmen Electra</PERSON> bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler? <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> arrives in her ship just as <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. Before you can say utter the word `hogwash,' <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> is revealing her secret to <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON>, who isn't surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON>'s family. <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> also makes pals with <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON>'s mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. Well, this is because <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON>'s father was an alien that abandoned her. Of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> so he can use <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON>'s DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. (Huh?) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.<br /><br />The ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is, both <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> and her superior's subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> this side of an <PERSON>Ed Wood</PERSON> film. Now, I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where <PERSON>Chong</PERSON> tells someone she comes from <LOCATION>Pleiades</LOCATION>, and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus, and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON> turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh, it has to be seen to be believed!<br /><br />Starlight, star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might, I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today.<br /><br /><PERSON>Zantara</PERSON>'s score: 1 out of 10.
1363 1 <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> is <PERSON>David Burton</PERSON>, a tax lawyer living in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> who is drawn into a murder trial defending five Aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>'s apocalyptic 1977 thriller The Last Wave. Taking up where Picnic at <LOCATION>Hanging Rock</LOCATION> left off, the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and, in the process, shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions. <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been "domesticated", their tribal laws and culture no longer apply. <br /><br />From the start, <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and "dream time" evaporates. Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps. As violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky, the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear. <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Annie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Olivia Hamnet</PERSON>) study books about the Aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions. When he invites one of his clients <PERSON>Chris Lee</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Gulpilil</PERSON>) to his home for dinner, he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> and his friend <PERSON>Charlie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Nadjiwarra Amagula</PERSON>), an enigmatic Aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants. As <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s investigation continues, his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder.<br /><br />After <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> starts to appear in his dreams, <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> is convinced that the Aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because "he saw too much", though <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> refuses to acknowledge this in court. <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>, becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel, says to his stepfather priest, "Why didn't you tell me there were mysteries?" This is a legitimate question but, according to the reverend, the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> answers all mysteries. <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves. Though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream, he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning.<br /><br />In this period of history in which native Hopi and Mayan prophecies predict the "end of history" and the purification of man leading to the Fifth World, The Last Wave, though 25 years old, is still timely. The Aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture, not one completely subjugated by the white man, yet I am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing. <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality, but he perpetuates the doom-orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear, showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time.
1364 0 Please Note: I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film. I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind.<br /><br />Although I know that <PERSON>Rene Clair</PERSON> has a lovely reputation as a film maker and <PERSON>Louise Brooks</PERSON> has a bit of a cult following as well, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929, up through the early to almost the mid-30s, a lot of famous French films were essentially silent films--with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. The lip movements in many, and in particular this film, don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms. <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> could do a French film. This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting.<br /><br />The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means "old"--not "slutty"). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancÃ© can't handle it. She gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! A tad melodramatic, huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finally, the character of the fiancÃ©'s friend(?) I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like <PERSON>Harold Lloyd</PERSON> and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited. Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? This seems to me that's what is implied and I don't like it at all.<br /><br />There are FAR better French films of the era (Le Million, <PERSON>La Femme du Boulanger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Fanny</ORGANIZATION>, Regain, and others) as well as better silent films. I just can't understand this film's high rating.
1365 1 This is one of my all-time favorite films, and while it may move too slowly for some, it's well worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (<PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON>) is dragged into a case involving "city" Aborigines, and this is no ordinary case. OK, a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing. There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately, and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive. The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans. This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about "City" vs. "Tribal" Aborigines, and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. Uh huh. <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening, although no matter how many times I've seen this I can't quite grasp the exact connection. This is a very eerie and creepy film, and is a fine example of <PERSON>Peter Weir</PERSON>'s ability to create tension out of nothing. The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally, it's the easiest way out and the scariest. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
1366 0 <PERSON>Lulu</PERSON> (<PERSON>Louise Brooks</PERSON>) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She enters a Miss <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> contest against the wishes of her boyfriend <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> (<PERSON>Georges Charlia</PERSON>) and she wins. She sets off for the Miss Europe title leaving her boyfriend behind. She wins again but returns home to <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> because he has asked her to. Once back together, her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> follows her.....<br /><br />This film is a silent film with a piano music-track all the way through. It is also sped-up so everything seems fast. Limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony. The cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film. The best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long. After watching this, I'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of <PERSON>Louise Brooks</PERSON> - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. I don't need to watch it again.
1367 1 I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. Now I've see many of them. As special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story called " The New House " was one of the most scariest films I ever saw. It was on once in 1972,...I was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. With all the remake going on in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, some one should do this one " as is " with no more special efx than the original. This episode was down right creepy as hell. I'm lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close was the ORIGINAL " The Haunting " and <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> in " The Changling " . Wish someone would do more ghost stories like these.
1368 0 Couldn't believe it! Clipped sentences? Good grief! Know what? All true! Real people ever talk like this? Don't think so. Good girl! Stout fellow! Stiffen upper lip! Only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> such a dish. Movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights. Seemed endless, anyway. Think all Franchot Tone's dialogue dubbed. When <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> and Young make a special effort to sound British they come over as Irish. Handy tip - we Brits clip words, not sentences. And somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time. But that's only if we've been to a really good public (that's private to you) school.
1369 1 I grew up watching this series. I was about seven/eight years old when it was on. I still remember the 1st episode which was called "The <ORGANIZATION>New House</ORGANIZATION>." It scared the h*ll out of me! I can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly. And the ending, oh my God! The hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: Yikes! This was classic TV and it was a one of a kind series. I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any readers: Has anyone purchased this set? Its a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD of "The New House" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids. A great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural. Thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- In fact, I'd love to discuss it. <PERSON>Chris Walker</PERSON>
1370 0 My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie would have to be at least worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up on it after 45 minutes. The idea that <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>, Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was, for me, impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> when no one talks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters, which is why we threw in the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that <ORGANIZATION>Hawks</ORGANIZATION> directed this, as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Hawksian rat-a-tat delivery. So save your time, and skip this one.
1371 1 Ghost Story,(The <ORGANIZATION>New House</ORGANIZATION>) is a terrific horror story. This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies.The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by <PERSON>Sebastian Cabot</PERSON>. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has <PERSON>Barbara Parkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Birney</PERSON> as the lead actors, and as the main characters in the story.I saw this recently,and I was so scared!If you are alone,I would not recommend that you watch this.This story is terrific,no gore or curse words, but very scary. <PERSON>Barbara Parkins</PERSON> played the young bride. <PERSON>David Birney</PERSON> played her husband.Both actors were very good in their parts.If you like scary, fun,terrifying ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. I gave this a high rating.I highly recommend this story.
1372 0 In what would be his first screenplay, based on his own short story "Turn About," <PERSON>William Faulkner</PERSON> delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and really strange relationships. The story originally was about only the Tone, <PERSON>Young</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> characters, but <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> needed to put <PERSON>Joan Crawford</PERSON> in another picture to fulfill her contract, and <PERSON>Faulkner</PERSON> obliged by creating a female role. <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars' Young and Tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch ("Wuthering Heights" performed in semaphore). Seriously, the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> read like <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON>.<br /><br />The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as may be found in his "Sanctuary," and elsewhere). When <PERSON>Young</PERSON> proposes to <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>, in Tone's presence, in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their Thelma & <PERSON>Louise</PERSON> fate. Frankly, it's creepy.<br /><br />Not as creepy to this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, which <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> cheerfully catches (and which is shown gamboling over her hands--I had to turn away!) and Young turns into a gladiator. <PERSON>Blech</PERSON>.<br /><br />That being said, there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON>'s fighter plane, and <PERSON>Roscoe Karns</PERSON> is delightful as <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON>'s flying buddy. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy <PERSON>Young</PERSON>'s fate. <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>, stripped of meaningful dialogue as well, mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic, which is quite a balancing act for one role.<br /><br />The battle scenes--not surprisingly, for a <ORGANIZATION>Howard Hawks</ORGANIZATION> film--are the most exciting part of the entire picture. But not enough. As far as I'm concerned, this is 75 minutes of my life I'm never going to get back.
1373 1 Ghost Story (the TV Movie--1972) was the pilot for the <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> series. The movie was well-written and well-acted and, I thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> has a winner. (I wish this film was available on video!!) The series was a colossal disappointment--even with <PERSON>William Castle</PERSON> as exec. producer. If, however,you have a chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You won't be disappointed.
1374 0 I am a big fan of <PERSON>Fred MacMurray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carole Lombard</PERSON>. And, in addition to them, <PERSON>Charles Butterworth</PERSON> (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film,...so why didn't I particularly enjoy it?! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clichÃ©d "A pictures" I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was. I knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next--and I was always right! And this isn't because I am some sort of "movie savant", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichÃ©s all strung together! Also, I found it a bit irritating that <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> mistreated <PERSON>Carole</PERSON> so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. Uggh! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie film ("will he bring people to rescue <PERSON>Timmy</PERSON> or will the rope he is dangling from break?").<br /><br />Despite the very, very tired and clichÃ©d script, there were a few positives about the film. It was pretty cool seeing <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days. Also, <PERSON>Charles Butterworth</PERSON>'s "prattle" did provide a few mildly humorous moments. But all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a "B movie". It's a shame,...it could have been so much better.
1375 1 This is a very entertaining flick, considering the budget and its length. The storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty. The acting was great (P'z to Dom) and the cinematography was also very well done. I recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers, it will not disappoint you!
1376 0 I've always liked <PERSON>Fred MacMurray</PERSON>, andÂ—although her career was tragically cut shortÂ—I think <PERSON>Carole Lombard</PERSON> is fun to watch. Pair these two major and attractive stars together, add top supporting players like <PERSON>Jean Dixon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anthony Quinn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dorothy Lamour</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Butterworth</PERSON>, give them a romantic script, team them with noted director <PERSON>Mitchell Leisen</PERSON> and you getÂ…a mediocre movie experience.<br /><br /><PERSON>Skid Johnson</PERSON> (<PERSON>Fred</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Carole</PERSON>) "meet cute" during her visit to the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION>, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid's a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall. During his climb to musical stardom, he neglects <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON>, who later inspires him to start over after he's hit rock bottom. Ah, yesÂ…it's the true <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> happy ending, which comes none too soon.<br /><br />Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it's difficult to watch at times. The early scenes set in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> are so draggy that they seem to go on forever, and later an alcoholic Skid just wanders endlessly in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carole</PERSON> try their best, but the tired script and S-L-O-W direction just don't give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, just doesn't ring true.<br /><br />This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars <PERSON>MacMurray</PERSON> and Lombard. However, I guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours.
1377 1 I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. <PERSON>Tess Nanavati</PERSON> is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, I'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. Kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold), and to whoever composed the music. The warped "Row Your Boat" blew me away. Very creative film all around....I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because I'd buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this film.
1378 0 What the ........... is this ? This must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high, but this is too stupid to be true. I baught this film for 0.89$ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ?<br /><br />Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? Well actually, you couldn't possible care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. They didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director ( <PERSON>Stephen Carpenter</PERSON> -- I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors. Complete crap as well, but at least that one had <PERSON>Eliza Dushku</PERSON>. This junk has the debut of <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON> !!! ( Who ?? ) Yeah that's right, the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She's the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? The rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually, are completely uninteresting. You're hoping they die a quick and painful death...and not only their characters<br /><br />My humble opinion = 0 / 10
1379 1 maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is, i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job. to do what she did with no budget...wow, thats all i can say. really, really good. like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away. i definitley suggest checking it out if you can. great directing, fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse. see it.
1380 0 If you've ever seen an eighties slasher, there isn't much reason to see this one. Originality often isn't one of slasher cinema's strongpoints, and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in. There really isn't much that can said about Pranks, so I'll make this quick. The film was one of the 74 films included on the <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION> Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason for seeing it. The plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at Christmas time. As they're in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite a few gory scenes, this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone, and gorier slashers than this (Friday the 13th, for example) didn't end up banned. But then again, there's banned films that are much less gory than this one (The Witch Who Came from the Sea, for example). Anyway, the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it, as although the audience really couldn't care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done. On the whole, this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.
1381 1 I had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon when I was searching for other films that stared <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON>. I thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his/her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep,it was an interesting film and a good part was played by <PERSON>Dom</PERSON>.......I believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere (well I've never seen it anywhere) you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance.
1382 0 This one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />The clichÃ¨s are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.<br /><br />This is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash.
1383 1 I'll come clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be...different, perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually excited about seeing it. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The film follows <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism.<br /><br />The directing is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />All in all, I give this great film 9 out of 10, for going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.
1384 0 One of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is notable only for an early performance by <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON> (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); her character dies fairly early on, and the rest of the film is totally forgettable.<br /><br />During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture. A crazy killer, however, throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways.<br /><br />Exploiting every stalk 'n' slash clichÃ© in the book, director <PERSON>Jeffrey Obrow</PERSON> delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed, so that I could get on with watching something more worthwhile. The majority of the deaths (which, let's face it, is why we generally watch this kind of film) are brief and not that gory; the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor (there is one notably bloody dismembered corpseÂ—the film could've done with more).<br /><br />At the last minute, the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending, but this really is one for slasher completists only.
1385 1 I first saw this movie at a festival. There were many good movies, but few kept me thinking about it long after, and An Insomniac's Nightmare was definitely one of them. <PERSON>Tess</PERSON> is definitely a gifted filmmaker. The shots were great. Casting was perfect. <PERSON>Dominic</PERSON> shined in his role that she perfectly crafted. There wasn't a lot to know about his character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. And <PERSON>Ellen</PERSON>-- I can't wait to see where she ends up! She's showing a lot of talent and I hope she does a few more films. With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, <PERSON>Tess</PERSON> shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors. Kudos to everyone involved with this film. And thanks to <PERSON>Tess</PERSON> and co. for distributing it on DVD!
1386 0 ((NB: Spoiler warning, such as it is!))<br /><br />First off, this is a teen slasher flick -- the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as <PERSON>Joe Bob Briggs</PERSON> piquantly put it. If you're looking for <LOCATION>Roshambo</LOCATION>, this isn't it and wasn't going to BE it. I'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly, this wasn't <PERSON>Zuniga</PERSON>'s first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it is worth; neither is <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon</PERSON> or <PERSON>Katherine Hepburn</PERSON>.<br /><br />Thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role. Another One Hit Wonder, except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(Then again, this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors, a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film. Three appeared in one other movie by the same producers. Only one other besides <PERSON>Zuniga</PERSON> has as many as six screen credits. What was this, the Has Been And Never Were Mutual Aid Society?)<br /><br />Granted, I saw this a long time ago on late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with <PERSON>Joanne</PERSON>.<br /><br />2/10.
1387 1 This is an almost action-less film following <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, an insomniac, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself off a building, and, for a lot of the time, can't tell reality from hallucination.<br /><br /><PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, is truly believable. Confused, and scared but lethargic and, at times blankly accepting of what he sees, we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep.<br /><br />Introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children that suddenly appear in <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, mind boggling, 43 minutes And the shower scene is enough to get any <PERSON>Dom</PERSON> fan coming back for more.
1388 0 It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I haven't the faintest idea. Unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a great prank; in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told. But there you go.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a badly made slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time. For slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
1389 1 An Insomniac's Nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity. Having chronic Insomnia, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't.<br /><br />We find out interesting things about <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a "happily ever after" Hollywood ending. Wrong. This is <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, the place where nobody sleeps.<br /><br /><PERSON>Tess Nanavati</PERSON> (Writer and Director) has herself a good film in 'An Insomniac's Nightmare'. A talented filmmaker and writer (she made this film right after her High School Graduation), she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future.<br /><br />As I watched this short film I was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, bleak scenery, and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> (as <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>), I desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.
1390 0 I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story. Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer. Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.
1391 1 This movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen. The writer/director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious. It has an eery feel with it's dark interpretations of illusions. <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> really became the insomniac. He is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either! He really poured his whole being into this role. From the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites. I recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative, creative writer/director/cinematographer!!!
1392 0 Eh, not a particular good slasher flick. So-so acting, effects, decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack.<br /><br />There are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes. Apart from that, there's a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or chasing after red herrings; more killing of time, than of people. There are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer, not partial to any one implement. The killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well. The identity isn't revealed towards the end, and motive is pretty thin, and we really don't care.<br /><br />Supposedly the movie takes place around Christmas, but this isn't a major factor. One scene gets lit by Christmas lights, that's about it.<br /><br />The movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the videotape I watched. Some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes. The ending should have been stronger than it was. We think we realize what happened, although there's a chance something else did.
1393 1 Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniac's Nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written, and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac.<br /><br />Starring <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> as <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on. The narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away. Fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep, balancing on the brink between sanity and madness.<br /><br />With twists and turns around every corner, An Insomniac's Nightmare is provocative and engaging. It comes very highly recommended.
1394 0 The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />First, <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON>, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />Second, the score by then known composer <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON>(<PERSON>Chris</PERSON>) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah, I know one star more is not much, but in this movie's case, it is a lot.<br /><br />The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah...we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Watch the first eighteen minutes with <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON>, then turn it off.
1395 1 This is one of the first independent movies I've ever seen. For such a very low budget, it was done well; as an insomniac myself, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing. <br /><br />Well directed, well acted, of a subject that I haven't seen much in theaters, lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting. There are few noticeable goofs, but they may be intended; you'll see after you watch the movie. The movie is very personal, and worth watching twice. No movie is flawless, but a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> version couldn't do the story better. all in all, 8/10.
1396 0 An uninteresting addition to the stalk 'n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980's. This was filmed as Pranks but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood. <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON> is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie (she has also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).
1397 1 I have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> fan. The movie itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was the <PERSON>Donnie Darko</PERSON> kind of "wtf?" factor after the movie had ended.<br /><br />Of course, with positive also come negative points. To me, the young girl in the film was incredibly good, and <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> did a good job as well. Unfortunately I don't have this opinion about <PERSON>Daniel Burke</PERSON>, who played <PERSON>Lonnie</PERSON>. This might just be me, and I'm not claiming to be a serious critic, in the way that I don't find myself skilled enough, but he just didn't seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps it's even more striking then, for although I am not a critic, this does get my attention.<br /><br />To conclude, over all I think it's definitely a film worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you just should have seen it.
1398 0 Probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever, badly acted and badly written.<br /><br />THE PLOT Five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm, but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one, the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper <PERSON>John Hemmitt</PERSON> played by <LOCATION>Woody Roll</LOCATION>, or could it be one of the five characters.<br /><br />ACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from <PERSON>Daphne Zungia</PERSON> who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest well quite dull although <PERSON>Laura Lapinski</PERSON> the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.<br /><br />THE KILLS Can't really see why they banned this, the kills look fake mostly, one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake, but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.<br /><br />OVERALL Not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
1399 1 I saw Insomniac's Nightmare not to long ago for the first time and I have to say, I really found it to be quite good. If you are a fan of <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> you will love it. The hole movie takes place inside his mind -or does it? The acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end. The extras on the DVD are just as great as the film, if not greater for those <PERSON>Dom</PERSON> fans. It has tons of candid moments from the set, outtakes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch <PERSON>Tess</PERSON> (the director), <PERSON>Dom</PERSON> and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film. It was pretty enjoyable and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
1400 0 I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory, so this video nastie is not really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids.<br /><br />I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality.
1401 1 An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. I loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, I would watch <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well. I was very impressed by the look of the film, too. Usually, "independent films" have a grainy, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director knows what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography...quality work. I'm looking forward to a feature-length work from <PERSON>Tess Nanavati</PERSON>!
1402 0 Over Christmas break, a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the work a bit more difficult, a murderous, Chucks-wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm, preying on the group in various violent ways.<br /><br />Registered as one of the 74 'video nasties' listed by the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing. The term 'video nasty' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore, violence, sex, etc.: All the things a horror fan dreams of. So, after hearing all of that info, I settled into Pranks (alt. title) expecting a sleazy slasher experience. . . and that's what it tried to be, but failed pretty much completely. Visually, the film's not great. The cinematography, gore (except for a couple scenes), and overall direction all fail. It's simply not enjoyable to watch. The unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason (like the opening kill). There are some cool death scenes, including a pretty nice face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but that's about it for the positive. The acting is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer isn't cool or scary, and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid: it's a bit boring. Overall, for a film done by a few <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> film students for $90,000 (which would be over double that today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood isn't a total mess. It has a couple good things, and is fairly watchable. . . But, as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it just cannot compare. Don't expect much, and you may at least be entertained. I hate to say it, but this is one of the few films I've seen that would actually be better with a remake. . . and yet, they go after great works like Black Christmas. Oh well. . .<br /><br />Obligatory Horror Elements:<br /><br />- Subgenre: Slasher<br /><br />- Violence/Gore: There are some brutally cool kills, and the gore is okay for the most part. . . but nothing special. Also, they off-screened some of the best murders.<br /><br />- Sex/Nudity: There's a little unappealing (to me) nudity, but not very much.<br /><br />- Cool Killer(s): Nah. The ending monologue(s) of the killer made him/her pretty uncool.<br /><br />- Scares/Suspense: A jump scare or two, but nothing too effective.<br /><br />- Mystery: I suppose, yeah, but I simply didn't care enough, and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Final verdict: 3.75/10. Bah! Humbug! <br /><br />-AP3-
1403 1 I didn't know what to except so I think it was a lot better not having excepted much. Don't get my wrong its not a bad short film. <PERSON>Tess Nanavati</PERSON> is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. You can tell that it has been an act of love for her. The acting (outside of <PERSON>Dominic</PERSON>) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. There was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though I don't feel it greatly detracts for one's ability to understand the film. If you love <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> as much as I do, I say go for it. The gag reel was fun, I won't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the DVD worth it just so you can watch it over and over. If you like the film then check out The Pink Mirror, a film also done by Jagged Edge. I know fans of <PERSON>Dominic</PERSON> will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
1404 0 <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON> is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not her, than what other reason to watch this. five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition. Problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting, and the group are short a few people. Then, a killer is on the loose. I honestly wanted to say I was going to enjoy this one. It had a fair set up, or maybe that was just <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON> in it. The film is too slow, and almost as silent as a library. Most of the acting is below average, and the "point-of-view" moments are so old news. Acclaimed composer <PERSON>Christopher Young</PERSON> of such films as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" scored this, in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a TV movie. Still, it seems higher than the movie deserves. So, other than Young and <PERSON>Zuniga</PERSON>, this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel.
1405 1 This film is one of the best shorts I've ever seen - and as I make it a point to be at all the major film festivals, I've seen a lot, especially of what the industry considers "the best." I'm not a fan of <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON>. His acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me, his only decent performance being in Lost, so I generally try to avoid his films. I did, however, happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed. This director really knows what she's doing. Of course, you are going to get the trolls (or just ignorant people) who don't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it. But luckily, from what I've seen, they are in the minority when it comes to this gem.<br /><br />Let's not deny that the film was working on no budget, and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work, because that's certainly true. The production value is very low, but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school? Pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter. If you take away a bit of the acting, the sound quality (which actually wasn't the fault of the filmmaker; I saw this at a festival and the sound was fine...I guarantee whoever made the DVD itself screwed up), and the fact it was shot on mini-DV, then what are you left with? The story, the visual composition and the soul of the film, which are indisputably flawless.<br /><br /><PERSON>Nanavati</PERSON> can tell a story. That much is clear. She can write substance-heavy, engaging scripts better than most people in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story, and bring it to life in a fascinating, creative way that, were this higher budget, might have won awards. Give it more experienced actors, better sound post-production, and 35mm instead of mini-DV and even the trolls couldn't complain. This girl is incredible, and keeping in mind that Insomniac was made a good few years ago, she's done some amazing work since. The trailer for Dreams of an Angel shows that, and I can't wait to see the higher budget stuff she's done. 9/10 stars, this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker.
1406 0 College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part. <PERSON>Stephen Sachs</PERSON> is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young <PERSON>Daphne Zuniga</PERSON> as an ill-fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.<br /><br />** out of ****
1407 1 I rated this a ten just because I find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera. It's no epic but it's plenty engaging and I was never bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse, then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know I'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release. Damn good job, and well worth the money. What a script! It might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures I've seen lately. <PERSON>Nanavati</PERSON> knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Serious kudos to her, can't wait to see more.
1408 0 A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does that whet your appetite? Well, then, belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history. For good measure, it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack <PERSON>Anne Rice</PERSON>. The directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog. Most of acting is amateurish. The production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market (<PERSON>Jasmine Guy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ben Vereen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pam Grier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eartha Kitt</PERSON>), including some faces that have barely been seen at all (<PERSON>Bianca Lawson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rachel Cuttrell</PERSON>). It also is, despite itself, a sterling showcase for <PERSON>Nicole Lyn</PERSON>. The pompous and ponderous <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> is on-hand as well. So, is the late <PERSON>Ossie Davis</PERSON>, a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary <ORGANIZATION>Negro Ensemble Company</ORGANIZATION>. This film should be rated "T" for tripe.
1409 1 This film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good of a story it is, how very well written the script is, and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money.<br /><br />All the elements of a great film are here. The visuals, though shot on digital, were gorgeous in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. It's such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that I have a whole lot of respect for this film. It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there.
1410 0 There's so little here of the fantastic <PERSON>Anne Rice</PERSON> book that what IS here makes no sense. Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence.<br /><br />Where's the relationship between <PERSON>Christophe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON>? Where's the continued affair between <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Juliet</PERSON>? Why does <PERSON>Dolly Rose</PERSON> appear at all, since her story's never explained? Where's the rape and redemption of <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>? Why does the film end with <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON>'s beating at the hands of his father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? <br /><br />As for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the actor playing <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>--but <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is <PERSON>Jasmine Guy</PERSON> as <PERSON>Dolly Rose</PERSON>, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with.<br /><br />All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any <PERSON>Anne Rice</PERSON> book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit. How is it that <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen?
1411 1 I came across An Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films, and glad to say it did NOT disappoint. This crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through, and the ending was excellent - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stays with you. I've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down. The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She creeped the heck out of me, I can say that much. <PERSON>Nanavati</PERSON> did a great job putting this short together. All the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script. SO well written. It's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The directing was great and the acting was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay. Good job to this girl, I can't wait to see more!
1412 0 The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was <PERSON>Carmen Electra</PERSON> until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about <PERSON>Peter Galleghar</PERSON>. He's one of my favorite actors. I love <PERSON>Anne Rice</PERSON>. I'm currently reading the <ORGANIZATION>Vampire Chronicles</ORGANIZATION>, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too"real" for me. I prefer <PERSON>Lestat</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON>'s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. <PERSON>Eartha Kitt</PERSON> was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not my type of show.
1413 1 I must say that I had wanted to see this film for a long time, and I was not disappointed. The acting of <PERSON>Dominic Monaghan</PERSON> is simply fantastic. As a part insomniac myself, I can relate with how the story develops. I have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary. It was a great film, worth every penny. I hope that one day I can work with <PERSON>Tess</PERSON> myself, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it for everybody. Maybe not small children as they may get scared. But if you are an insomniac like me, you'll understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You'll love it. <br /><br />F.
1414 0 "Feast of All Saints?" Where...? When...?<br /><br />Was the Feast of <ORGANIZATION>All Saints</ORGANIZATION> storyline and theme edited out? <br /><br />What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the "Feast of All Saints." Nor is there anything in the story about "All Souls Day" which the term is referencing. Why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about "All Souls Day" or the "Feast of All Saints"? <br /><br />Embarrassly Bad Script & Amateur Writing <br /><br />How did they attract such great talent to this clunker? The writing is so amateur--characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience. Not at all the way people talk to each other. <br /><br />What was the Director Thinking?<br /><br />The directing is equally bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish. In one scene, a character is yelling "Take your hands off of me" and NO ONE is touching him! The most badly directed scene however, is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Excessive <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> in a Very Fake, Silly Battle Scene<br /><br />There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit!! You can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera. Everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys--exaggerating every little gasp and twitch. The blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes.<br /><br />This whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like <PERSON>Will Ferrell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Myers</PERSON> to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline.<br /><br />Who in Real Life Would Ever Behave this Way?! <br /><br />The most ridiculous bit of writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /><br />A little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father--who is terribly mutilated, and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds. Even a totally idiot would know he is dead! Yet she is--very monotonously--repeating over and over "Daddy, daddy..." while looking at someone off-screen. She delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day.<br /><br />Even if the poor kid had any acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. The little girl wouldn't even BE in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage--surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies, while she calmly stands there!! Natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified, running AWAY from the bloody carnage! <br /><br />Are we Suppose to be Horrified or Laugh...?!<br /><br />One particularly goofy detail, that gives the scene an SNL satire tone, is the father hanging, with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! The unintentionally funny details, make the whole scene come across as fake and silly.<br /><br />In Fantasy La-La-Land, Mothers and Daughters are the Same Age! <br /><br />Another funny detail, is that you see a central character--the little girl's mother--at the end of the scene and in the next scene, that occurs 20+ years later, she looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /><br />I almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful--but I tried to stick it out because I wanted to see the <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> settings and I like all the actors. I don't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles!<br /><br />Who was the Targeted Audience?<br /><br />The excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows. It is also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems targeted to romance novel reading females. Weird inconsistency in tone!
1415 1 Have to be honest and say that I haven't seen many independent films, but I thought this one was very well done. The direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction. The angles, settings, and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped. Many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director).
1416 0 The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous.

1417 1 An ok movie about downs syndrome. A mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs. The mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs! the mom does not like this & she thinks he should be with his family ( I agree too ) so they take it to court & the family gets broken up & the grandparents lose, it never really says if the mom & daughter makeup? I think this movie's good but the plot is familiar, it's still good & has a few unintentional laughs!
1418 0 This movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. It should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the acting. You have <PERSON>Jennifer Beals</PERSON> on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, <PERSON>Ri</PERSON>'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. <PERSON>Peter Gallagher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jenny Levine</PERSON> are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. The actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English. The casting is ludicrous. Why have children of an "African" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable <PERSON>Marcel</PERSON>, has pronounced African features, including an obviously dyed blond "fro"? It's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It's just so weird! This could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. There are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how <PERSON>Jennifer Beals</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Sunjata</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gloria Reuben</PERSON> would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.
1419 1 Hello everyone, This is my first time posting and I just love the movie No child of mine and I could watch it over and over!! well I taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and I dropped it and broke it and I haven't seen it in a few years!! could any one please tell me when it will come on again!! I would really appreciate it alot!!You can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including Empty Cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to PLEASE let me know,I would really appreciate it ALOT!!!<br /><br />
1420 0 I read <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s novel with interest, and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths.<br /><br />However, I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based merely on physical appearance, and not acting talent (with the obvious exception of <PERSON>Peter Gallagher</PERSON>, who was neither blond-haired, or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). The cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious, but not in an entertaining way. I found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe, and was surprised I made it to the end.<br /><br />A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one.
1421 1 While I don't agree with <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Tammy</PERSON>'s decision to give up baby <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON>, and it's something I'd never do, they were trying to do what was best for the baby. The way this movie is written, you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe, from all different aspects. <PERSON>Patty Duke</PERSON>? Antagonist? Almost unheard of, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie, she really convinces you that she's psychotic, or at least, that there's something seriously wrong with her. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed." The movie seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unresolved. But other than that, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that'll make you laugh. But it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from others' perspectives, and discover a little something about yourself. Caution: you may even grow while watching this movie! And it's all worth it, in the end.
1422 0 I'm not sure this is a spoiler; perhaps it is a public service. If you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits, you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice-over, which states the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has just surrendered to Nazi <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> on May 7, 1945 to end WWII. Here are just a few of the problems with this close: <br /><br />1)The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLY movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion.<br /><br />2)The average person will really kick themselves that they did not "watch" one of these UNHOLY fill-in-the-blanks flicks created in their own head for free, instead of shelling out time and money to see this UNHOLY from the video store (or on cable).<br /><br />3)This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII, leading them to the conclusion that <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> is the latest heir to the Nazi throne.
1423 1 "<ORGANIZATION>Rock 'n' Roll High School</ORGANIZATION>" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick. Portraying a bunch of high school students using the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (<PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>, of "Eating Raoul" fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute. It's basically a big excuse to have fun, and I'm sure that you will. Bullied freshmen? Check. A dorky music teacher (<PERSON>Paul Bartel</PERSON>, also from "Eating Raoul"*)? Check. Exploding mice? Checkmate.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who doesn't know the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>' music, it's pure pleasure. With <PERSON>Roger Corman</PERSON> executive producing and <PERSON>Joe Dante</PERSON> co-directing, how could we expect anything less? Too bad that director <PERSON>Allan Arkush</PERSON> later degenerated into fare such as "Caddyshack II".<br /><br />Also starring <PERSON>P.J. Soles</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vincent Van Patten</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clint Howard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dick Miller</PERSON> (who has appeared in every one of <PERSON>Joe Dante</PERSON>'s movies, and many of <PERSON>Roger Corman</PERSON>'s), <PERSON>Don Steele</PERSON>, and of course the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>. A real treat.<br /><br />*It seems like <PERSON>Bartel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Woronov</PERSON> always co-starred. They also co-starred in <PERSON>Joe Dante</PERSON>'s "<LOCATION>Hollywood Boulevard</LOCATION>" and the slasher flick "Chopping Mall" (also starring <PERSON>Dick Miller</PERSON>)...in which they reprised their roles from "Eating Raoul".
1424 0 When I started watching this movie I saw the dude from <PERSON>Buffy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Xander</PERSON>, and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies. Now a weird movie I can stand, given that it's a good dose of weird like for example <PERSON>David Lynch</PERSON> movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc. And you sort of have to be in the mood for one. This one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no sense. I mean come on people <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION>'s who conspire with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to make an unholy trinity of evil powers? I was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense, but seriously I don't condone drugs like I don't condone this movie. It should be burned, shredded and forgotten just so good ol' <PERSON>Xander</PERSON> might get another acting job. It wasn't his acting though, that was alright, but the script just didn't make any sense. Sorry.
1425 1 I simply love this movie. I also love the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>, so I am sorta biased to begin with in the first place. There isn't a lot of critical praise to give this film, either you like it or you don't. I think it's a great cult movie.
1426 0 Can I please say first of all, that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up to IMDb specifically to review it. And my review? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- Nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together. Remember the episode of <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION> that featured manatees writing Family Guy using 'idea balls'? Did these manatees also write Unholy? Its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but had no idea how to link them all together, and then to make things make even less sense, included a <PERSON>Donnie Darko-esquire</PERSON> time travel theme to the ending, messing up the chronology.<br /><br />I could tell from early on that this was a bad movie. Special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to DVD. The acting wasn't great, but in fairness I've seen worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the evil <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> butcher guy was just comic.<br /><br />I don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even into the horror genre. But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been well told, this would have been a good movie. But it has been over hyped. Waaaaay over hyped.
1427 1 this movie is awesome. sort of. it dosent really say much, or do much, but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is. the high school is taken over by evil ms.togar that hates the one thing that all the students love, rock& roll. riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show, and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle & the ramones. this movie has everything, a bad script, questionable directing, bad actors(ie clint howard & p.j. soles), an awesome soundtrack,extreme campyness, these elements & much more come together to make this what it is,a classic.<br /><br />note - during the live ramones set, notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd. neat-o.
1428 0 This is a movie of tired, yet weirdly childish, clichÃ©s. There's a Nazi witch master performing sf-related experiments in the basement? Oh please! <br /><br />Aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear, the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright. Not having any expectations beforehand, I am left with: an aged <PERSON>Xander</PERSON> from <PERSON>Buffy</PERSON> and a heroine with ape-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act. Said <PERSON>Adrienne Barbeau</PERSON> have I only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death".<br /><br />Camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame.
1429 1 Even if you're not a big Ramones fan, <ORGANIZATION>Rock 'N' Roll High School</ORGANIZATION> is *still* the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made. Why? Because under all the campiness, it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel (and justifiably so) for the boring, stupid, fascist, establishment world of adults. That final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie I have ever seen. "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the..." Rock 'n' roll!<br /><br />
1430 0 This sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis, occult , government conspiracies. I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> or even Shockwaves. Instead you get something quite different, more psychological, more something like from <PERSON>David Lynch</PERSON>. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful.<br /><br />Part of the trouble is the casting. <PERSON>Andrienne Barbeau</PERSON>'s character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid. She just doesn't do that well, even at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie, or at least acted like it, rather than simply being quirky. The only one that I thought did really well was the daughter, <PERSON>Siri Baruc</PERSON>.<br /><br />Another big part is the pacing. It starts off very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath. But shortly afterward, it all becomes a jumbled mess. Some of this was on purpose, but much of it was just needlessly confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused.<br /><br />The real problem, is it's simply not a pleasant movie to watch. It's slow, dull, none of the characters are likable. Overuse of imagery and sets. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In this, it's the viewer that does. It does have a few creepy moments, most notably the creepy Nazi paintings and the credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome.
1431 1 All the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the Ramones would probably say that <PERSON>Amadeus</PERSON> was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist. Rock and Roll High School was centered around the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>. How anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of <PERSON>Joey Ramone</PERSON> eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy-o. Ms Trogar, exploding white mice, the hall patrols...instant classics. Nevermind the <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON> character.<br /><br />If you don't like the <PERSON>Ramones</PERSON> then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
1432 0 This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is absolutely no storyline, the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie Fredi (oh my god what a funny name. ha ha) doesn't ask himself ONCE how he came from a plane to middle earth. There are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. e.g. : <ORGANIZATION>Gandalf</ORGANIZATION> is called <PERSON>Almghandi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> is called Pupsi ... and so on. I didn't even smile once during the whole movie. The gags seem like they were made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times) then this movie is perhaps for you. Another funny scene: They try to guess the code word for a closed door (don't ask why- don't ever ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): dung. So if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie. For everybody else: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": it's a lot, lot more fun.
1433 1 Hello. This movie is.......well.......okay. Just kidding! ITS AWESOME! It's NOT a Block <PERSON>Buster</PERSON> smash hit. It's not meant to be. But its a big hit in my world. And my sisters. We are rockin' Rollers. GO RAMONES!!!! This is a great movie.............. For ME!
1434 0 It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I don't doubt any second that there are people who'll like this sense of "humor", but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as <PERSON>Mel Brooks</PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION>Zucker Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. I'm working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: At the movies it was a nice (but no big at all) success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. In the last ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one was worse, but I'm happy that there a so many good movies so I don't have to think too much on this question.
1435 1 huge <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fan. i do like the ramones, and i suppose if you hate them, then, besides being a avid <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> supporter, you might not like this classic.<br /><br />it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's. infinitely better than the American Pie's that plague us now.<br /><br />There are some other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High, and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun, plus you can get up and dance with it.<br /><br />I love you, <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON>.<br /><br />10/10
1436 0 The main reason people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." is that it features <PERSON>Peter Sellers</PERSON> in a second-billed role. But watching this film to see <PERSON>Peter Sellers</PERSON> is a mistake.<br /><br />Sellers plays <PERSON>Amphibulos</PERSON>, a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt-poor island nation of <LOCATION>Gaillardia</LOCATION>, formerly a British colony, now hosting a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War. <PERSON>Amphibulos</PERSON> wants to play both <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit, "everything very friendly and all our cards under the table". <PERSON>Terry-Thomas</PERSON> is the title character, a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> hasn't forgotten them, all appearances to the contrary.<br /><br />A positive review here says: "The reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated." I would argue that the reason "Carlton-Browne" is considered below average is because the comedy is non-existent.<br /><br />After a decent opening that establishes the film's only two strengths, a sympathetically doltish Terry-Thomas and <PERSON>John Addison</PERSON>'s full-on larky score, things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes. The low opinion of Carlton-Browne by his boss and the obscurity of Gaillardia (which no one can find on a map) is milked to death. By the time we actually reach the island (after a labored series of airsick jokes), expectations are quite low.<br /><br />They're still too high, though. The island itself, which seems to exist either in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> or the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>, is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport, and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still horse drawn, allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick-accented announcer: "In war, the army uses many horse."<br /><br />Sellers never quite takes center stage even when we're on his character's island. The plot is taken over instead by <PERSON>Ian Bannen</PERSON> as King <PERSON>Loris</PERSON>, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after his father's assassination. <PERSON>Bannen</PERSON> is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written. Normally this would make him the likely target for scene-stealing by Sellers, but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache, Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year, "The Mouse That Roared" and "I'm All Right, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>."<br /><br />Strange that this film, like "Jack", was a <ORGANIZATION>Boulting Brothers</ORGANIZATION> production, with <PERSON>Roy Boulting</PERSON> here serving as co-director alongside <PERSON>Jeffrey Dell</PERSON>. Usually <PERSON>Boulting</PERSON> films combine wicked social satire with anything-goes comedy, but here there are only fey jabs in either direction. Amphibulos works his mangled-English vibe for all its worth ("This man is like, how do you say, the bull in the Chinese ship") while Carlton-Browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve.<br /><br />The weakest and most protracted element of the film is young <PERSON>Loris</PERSON>'s romance with <PERSON>Ilyena</PERSON>. Score one point for her being played by ravishing <PERSON>Luciana Paluzzi</PERSON>, dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed.<br /><br />The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one, and a final bit of action by <PERSON>Carlton-Browne</PERSON> that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally. Apparently he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly DOA.
1437 1 <ORGANIZATION>Rock 'n' Roll High School</ORGANIZATION> was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so awesome was because of The Ramones! You couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash in place of <ORGANIZATION>The Ramones</ORGANIZATION>, it just wouldn't have been the same. dey young, clint howard, <PERSON>Vincent Van Patten</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Bartel</PERSON>, and the hall monters, just added to the movie. The whole entire movie is about The Ramones...especially <PERSON>Joey</PERSON>! So everybody showed see <ORGANIZATION>Rock 'n' Roll High School</ORGANIZATION> if your a huge fan of real PUNK. Not the sissy new crap...but the loud, and fast kind. The kind only The Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) <PERSON>Joey Ramone</PERSON> 1951-2001. <PERSON>Dee Dee Ramone</PERSON> 1952-2002!
1438 0 This film, though ostensibly a comedy, is deadly serious. Its subject is Imperialism (with a capital I): how <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, foolishly, humiliatingly, tries to convince itself that it's still a great power after World War II. At home, the Empire is run by amiable dolts, benevolent Tories who are so in-bred that they can't distinguish close relatives; the Offices of Government consist of long forgotten archives (a dig at Orwellian paranoia?), inhabited by indolent rats, and ante-rooms wherein lounge bored synacures, reading popular novels.<br /><br />Abroad, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> clings to the old pomp; but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly, especially when its embodied in bumbling twits. <PERSON>Carlton-Browne</PERSON> is an unsentimental picture of decline, with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti-imperialist Jewel in the Crown.<br /><br />The film is also about the Cold War, bravely admitting that it's a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. It's about how colonialism, characterised more by neglect than tyranny, destroys the colonies it deserts, robbing them of amenities, power, and, most importantly, self-respect, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys.<br /><br />It's the seriousness, of course, that kills it. That's not to say that weighty subjects can't be treated in comedy - The Miracle Of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Creek</LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON>Strangelove</PERSON> and The Life Of <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> have all proved that. Indeed, one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy - it allows for a clearer-eyed view.<br /><br />The problem with <PERSON>Carlton-Browne</PERSON> is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic, so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here, the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations, and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled - Peter Sellers, <PERSON>Terry-Thomas</PERSON>, <PERSON>Raymond Huntley</PERSON> and <PERSON>John le Mesurier</PERSON> - are criminally wasted.<br /><br />Terry-Thomas, sublime so often, shows that he couldn't handle lead parts, and that he needed to play sneering, arrogant bounders, not brainless toffs. The music is made to carry much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen. (To be fair, unlike the majority of British comedies of the period, which were stagy and underproduced, the Boultings often try to make their points through film itself, by montage and composition) Only <PERSON>Huntley</PERSON> manages to raise genuine laughs, and that's by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep.<br /><br />None of the Boultings' farces have dated well - they're never thought through enough. Although <PERSON>Carlton-Browne</PERSON> revels in the decline of the Empire, it also seems to be anti-democratic and militaristic. I'm sure this wasn't intended, but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.
1439 1 Though this movie is cheesiness at its best, it is pulled off perfectly. This movie, without a doubt, has to be considered a modern classic. There are basically two kinds of movies I like - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you must - I blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the latter.<br /><br />A friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release. Considering me to somewhat shallow, he said to me, "You've got to see this movie. It's just your type of movie." Foregoing the insult, I started watching. I know they mentioned The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it is The Ramones." My friend replied, "I don't know they were a real band." I had my moment of glory.<br /><br />This movie, though now somewhat dated, is a must see for <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fans - or anyone else for that matter.
1440 0 You may want to know up front that I am not a Mormon, unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film. I mention this so you'll understand that the way I look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith. For some, being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith--and that is NOT my intention. So, my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were. Well, after seeing the film, I doubt if I have learned much at all. Since I have been a history teacher, I have a good basic understanding about <PERSON>Young</PERSON> as well as <PERSON>Joseph Smith</PERSON> as well as the teachings of the church. But anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh-darn nice--too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal. Plus, you learn practically nothing about the church's beliefs other than they are nice people, work hard and some have many wives (and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film). Instead, the people are almost cartoon-like in their simplistic portrayals. <PERSON>Joseph Smith</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> and their followers are angelic, the non-Mormons were all devils and <PERSON>Brian Donlevy</PERSON> (playing EXACTLY the same sort of role <PERSON>Edward G. Robinson</PERSON> later played in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS) is the trouble-maker who claims to be a Mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy. It's all so very simple....too simple. Almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> especially was a very complex man--with many good points (an excellent organizer and visionary) as well as bad (don't even get me started on his views about Blacks within the church or intermarriage). To portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly. It's also a lot like how <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> was portrayed in the film with <PERSON>Ben Kingsley</PERSON>--only the facts that led to his being almost super-human were emphasized. Heck, now that I think about that, this is the trouble with most religious films--they often come off as one-dimensional, trite and bland. Let's have a full and more complete film of these men--one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals.<br /><br />Now if you can ignore the fact that you won't learn very much about the faith or its second leader, the film is enjoyable enough. It's obvious someone at 20th Century-Fox really cared about the film, as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors (<PERSON>Tyrone Power</PERSON>), up and coming actors (<PERSON>Linda Darnell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jane Darwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vincent Price</PERSON>) and wonderful character actors (<PERSON>Dean Jagger</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Carradine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brian Donlevy</PERSON>). The film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss. It just didn't have a lot to tell us other than they were all "swell". Plus, there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes. A few of the mistakes include <PERSON>Young</PERSON> taking over the helm immediately after the death of <PERSON>Joseph Smith</PERSON> (it was three years later), no mention of the various Mormon denominations and splinter groups, talk of "gold in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>"--even though it was 1847 and gold wouldn't be discovered until 1948, as well as no specific mention of polygamy or <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s many wives. Just plain dumb scenes include <PERSON>Carradine</PERSON> pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene--and no one seemed to care--even though it was a very hostile audience! Don't you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it?!<br /><br />One final comment. Do not, I repeat, do not watch this film when it's shown on <ORGANIZATION>American Movie Classics</ORGANIZATION> (a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years). While I am critical of the film because of its simplistic message, I was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions. What I mean is this. The film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop-ups (some advertising a show that features the "sexiest cast"). Talk about disrespectful and gross and I would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film. By doing this, they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market--after all, who is into hearing about these things AND the life of Brigham Young?! Is this a movie, in this form, that you can show to your kids or recommend to others?!
1441 1 Just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this: the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" is taking place in that world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. The characters are all as silly, innocent and charming as the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>' songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with this late 70's classic, where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all. Since a remake is apparently in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar, half-funny dick jokes, as <PERSON>Bill Hicks</PERSON> used to call them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones CANNOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place. So, the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, as quirky and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
1442 0 This film has got several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. This means that the film cannot captivate it's audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very BAD! Do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
1443 1 ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>. I was too young during the band's mid-70s heyday to be very aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-80s when I was about fifteen years old, and laughed all the way through it. (Isn't it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up, all set to a rockin' soundtrack?) I recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> concert sequences over and over again, thinking "Man, these guys kick ass! I have to check out some of their albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, umpteen Ramones LPs/cassettes/CDs, and three <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> shows later, they're still one of my all time favorite bands and RNRHS still cracks me up every time I watch it. Now that <PERSON>Joey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dee Dee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON> have left us (R.I.P. all)at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by.
1444 0 One scene demonstrates the mentality of "Terminator Woman" pretty well: <PERSON>Karen Sheperd</PERSON> and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp. <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> runs across an armed guard, who points his gun at her, but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight. <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> kicks him in the balls, picks up the gun and runs away! Then again, when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you shouldn't expect too much. <PERSON>Karen Sheperd</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Trimble</PERSON> do get some amusing banter going early on, and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they get separated, and the film slows to a crawl, and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up, it lacks excitement. The finale has Trimble fighting <PERSON>Qissi</PERSON> inside a cave and Sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful <PERSON>Ashley Hayden</PERSON> on a speedboat, but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value. On the positive side, kudos to the costuming department for giving <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (*1/2)
1445 1 One of b- and c-movie producer <PERSON>Roger Corman</PERSON>'s greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle (originally designated for Cheap Trick), <ORGANIZATION>Rock N' Roll High School</ORGANIZATION>. It's just a simple, technically dated story (but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> Dynamite characters funny--see <PERSON>Eaglebauer</PERSON>'s van) about teenagers who love rock n' roll.<br /><br />Students at <ORGANIZATION>Vince Lombardi High School</ORGANIZATION> are met with resistance by the evil principal, Miss <PERSON>Evelyn Togar</PERSON> (played by cult classic favorite, <PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>) who fears that Rock N' Roll turns kids into uncontrollable, amoral deviants and vows to make a Rock N' Roll-free zone. Actually, she intends to wipe out Rock N' Roll for all students, regardless of whether its at school, and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful.<br /><br />But not if <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>PJ Soles</ORGANIZATION>) can help it. A <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fanatic, she has written some songs (including <ORGANIZATION>Rock N' Roll High School</ORGANIZATION>) that she wants to give to the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>, and in trying to do so, is rebuffed by <PERSON>Miss Togar</PERSON> who does all she can to keep her from going to see the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> play in town. It culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adults and the teenagers (in an ending that is reminiscent of Over the Edge, somewhat). After the years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> (and others) would mark another shift in music evolution, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous, exaggerated way.<br /><br />It is mostly mild comedy, but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you. With <PERSON>Jerry Zucker</PERSON> (of Airplane fame) and <PERSON>Joe Dante</PERSON> (of Gremlins fame) both taking part in some of the directing, you can get the idea for what kind of humor you're in for (and not to mention, expect to see <PERSON>Dick Miller</PERSON> even if only for a few minutes in the film's finale). The story must've later inspired (and was consequently updated) by the mid-90s comedy, <LOCATION>Detroit Rock City</LOCATION>, which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers, <PERSON>Kizz</PERSON>.<br /><br />I would recommend passing on the <PERSON>Corey Feldman</PERSON> vehicle, <ORGANIZATION>Rock N' Roll High School Forever</ORGANIZATION>, released nearly a decade later. The original is still the best.
1446 0 I just didn't get this movie...Was it a musical? no..but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it...<br /><br />Was it a serious drama....no the acting was not good enough for that.<br /><br />Is <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> a quality serious Actor..Definently not.<br /><br />I had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie. The message on apartheid and the "tribute" to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted. But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse.<br /><br />See for yourself, but in fairness I hated it
1447 1 <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON> is a wildly, obsessed fan of the rock group; The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> and so are most of the students in the school. But a new tyrant of a principal, Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students, especially the music from The Ramones. So, when <PERSON>Riff</PERSON> finds out they're performing in town, she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends. But when Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets. While, this is happening <PERSON>Tom Roberts</PERSON> is totally love struck over Riff, but <PERSON>Riff</PERSON>'s friend <PERSON>Kate Rambeau</PERSON> feels the same way about <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>. But Riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer <PERSON>Joe Ramone</PERSON> and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song.<br /><br />Fun! Fun! Fun! Yep, that's right '<ORGANIZATION>Rock n Roll high School</ORGANIZATION>' doesn't drift away from it main focusÂ… a boisterously, daggy romp! It wasn't what I was expecting, that's for sure. Everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit, which makes it a priceless experience. That's not to say I think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be. But watching this passionately, crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks, I just couldn't wipe the grin off my face. It's tacky, very cheesy, densely chaotic, but damn it's funky-dory! <br /><br />This low-budget, b-grade feature from producer <PERSON>Roger Corman</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Dante</PERSON> who was co-writer ( and plus he co-directed some scenes when director <PERSON>Allan Arkush</PERSON> was hospitalised on the last day shoot). Is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichÃ©s and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults (who always know best). These features might not be particularly fresh, but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically, gusto treatment. The film has just one thing on mind, to go out on a bang! And they manage to do that. Courtesy of 'The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>', who play themselves. Really, you could say its one big trendy video clip, since it's all about the RamonesÂ… well, most of it anyway. I see a lot flack towards The Ramones' acting ability. These are musicians not actors, which means it's not about their acting here, it's the music we're suppose to dig. They're here to perform! Which, they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe. Especially, their flamboyant concert performances. The buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as <PERSON>Devo</PERSON>, The Velvet Underground, MC5, <PERSON>Fleetwood Mack</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> and the Hot Rods and <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON>. But these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well. Especially in the scenes involving Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set. The playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it's sometimes clever, tongue-in-cheek dialogue. Thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags, which I found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself.<br /><br />What else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine <PERSON>PJ Soles</PERSON> (better known for her performance in <LOCATION>Halloween</LOCATION>), who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON>. Other exemplary performances were <PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON>, as the extremely cute <PERSON>Kate Rambeau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vincent Van Patten</PERSON> as the gawky <PERSON>Tom Roberts</PERSON> and the go to man Eaglebauer who's stupendously played by <PERSON>Clint Howard</PERSON>. Also some top drawer <PERSON>Corman</PERSON> regulars pop up with great send up performances by <PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON> who's excellent as the demanding Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> who's pushing her unfair reign on the students, <PERSON>Paul Bartel</PERSON> as Mr. <PERSON>McGree</PERSON> and a small support role from <PERSON>Dick Millar</PERSON> towards the end. The enthusiastic acting is pretty campy, but that goes down well with the material and there's a certain likability stemming from these characters, but we totally despise Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> and her hall monitor goons.<br /><br />There's no beating around the bush here when I say 'Rock 'n' Roll High School' is an intoxicating hoot, of a rad time!
1448 0 The concept for <PERSON>Sarafina</PERSON> appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. It attempts to combine upbeat African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. Had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs. <br /><br />Aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast. Overall a disappointment.<br /><br />3/10
1449 1 The movie is just plain fun....maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" around the time the film was made. I've watched the film over and over, by myself and with friends, and it is still fresh and funny. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless.<br /><br />And, the film has some gem lines/scenes.....references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life. (Let me assure you I've been out of high school for, uhhh, some years and it's not following me).....the famous "static" line ("I'm getting some static"....."Not as much as you're going to get", as Principal Togar approaches).....the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses....the <ORGANIZATION>Nazi Hall Monitors</ORGANIZATION> love for a "body search" ......Principal Togar announcing, "I give you the final solution", and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD's) ....and of course <PERSON>Joey Ramone</PERSON> noting, "Things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school", followed by <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> asking "Do your parents know you're Ramones?"<br /><br />Just one piece of advice.....don't look up where the stars are now.....<PERSON>Joey Ramone</PERSON> sadly died young. <PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON>, who was a major hottie in the film, today reminds us we all age....PJ Soles career never advanced as we might have expected......... <PERSON>Marla Rosenfield</PERSON>, as one the other students, apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film), though I submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles. And, does anyone know what happened to DJ <PERSON>Don Steele</PERSON>? <br /><br />So, watch and enjoy.....don't think....just have FUN!
1450 0 This was an awful movie! Not for the subject matter, but for the delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no uplift at the end. The previews and ads made NO mention of this! Plus, for all that they played up whoopi goldberg, my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would've never have seen it. Or at least, I would've been prepared for it. This was a bait and switch ad campaign, and I will NEVER see this movie again!
1451 1 Fascist principal Miss <PERSON>Togar</PERSON>(<PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>, who is lensed by expert photographer <PERSON>Dean Cundy</PERSON> as if she were ten feet tall)has a plan to turn her high completely square. Complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON>(<ORGANIZATION>PJ Soles</ORGANIZATION> who lights up the screen--she's got a hot bod, too)who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE <ORGANIZATION>RAMONES</ORGANIZATION>. Pal <PERSON>Kate Rambeau</PERSON>(<PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON>, whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty)joins forces with Riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is <PERSON>Togar</PERSON>'s desired mission.<br /><br /><PERSON>Vincent Van Patten</PERSON> has a hilarious role as <PERSON>Tom Roberts</PERSON>, a success at everything, but getting laid. <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> is crazy about <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>..if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it. <PERSON>Clint Howard</PERSON> steals the film almost(honestly, who can steal this film away from Soles?)as <PERSON>Eaglebauer</PERSON>, "the supplier" who can get everyone almost anything. His office is located in the boy's restroom! <PERSON>Paul Bartel</PERSON> is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of <PERSON>Riff</PERSON>'s when he enjoys a concert of THE <ORGANIZATION>RAMONES</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br />A raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy..and I loved it. It's like someone just says, "Let's make life fun for 1Â½ hours." The film really is anarchy..a plot-less chaos lovingly adoring THE <ORGANIZATION>RAMONES</ORGANIZATION> with all it's heart(even if they are horrible actors, they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film).<br /><br />The ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole..Riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins. To be honest, I didn't want the party to end! Not conventional in any way whatsoever, this film just let's loose a frenzy. Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of THE RAMONES best songs, this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't dominate headlines and people just had a good time. Those, I guess were the days.
1452 0 I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. To me it was rather a disappointment, especially the combination of historical facts, fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all (in <PERSON>Vonnegut</PERSON>'s book Slaughterhouse Five and even in <PERSON>George Roy Hill</PERSON>'s adaptation for the screen it does). Credibility is often overstretched. Too many questions are left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? <br /><br />A boy called <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, Jr., grows up in upstate <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book, his dad doesn't like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>. BANG. It is 1938, the boy is a married man in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? Don't ask me.<br /><br />Possibly, the man just does not care, is not interested in politics, is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two (meaning he and his wife). There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie, it much more seems a Republic of One.<br /><br />On the request of an American agent <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jr.</PERSON>, agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> park bench is short, unexciting and anti climactic, the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation, the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.<br /><br />So now we have <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jr.</PERSON>, presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, Jr., really and honestly had to cough, hiccup etc. (must have scrambled the messages terribly). Anyway, the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> lose, the wife dies (touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II), <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, Jr., says he goes to the Russian front but does not go, is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?), is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>, is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.<br /><br />AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS <br /><br />BANG. From now on it is like a short story by <PERSON>Paul Auster</PERSON>. It is 1961, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, Jr., lives in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares - or do they? Yes, somehow they do, and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION> survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists Â„discover" him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him, or is she his wife? Anyway, in the end <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, Jr., calls in at the Israeli consulate, and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment, placing him in the cell adjacent to <PERSON>Adolf Eichmann</PERSON>'s. He writes his life story and, once this task finished, hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.<br /><br />While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss, I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. Amazingly, many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero, having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American. I assume according to them this took a lot of courage. As a matter of fact, however, the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> created for himself a win-win situation, as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.<br /><br />One might argue, that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. But even then it fails to make a point, primarily, I suspect, because the love affair in the <LOCATION>Republic of Two</LOCATION> falls completely flat. This is a pity, especially if you consider that the wife was played by <PERSON>Sheryl Lee</PERSON>, a talented, versatile and sensuous actress. She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts (confession, broadcast and hidden messages), but I guess this is largely unfilmable. Maybe I should give the book a chance.
1453 1 <ORGANIZATION>Vince Lombardi High School</ORGANIZATION> has a new principal--the evil Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with <PERSON>Riff Randall</PERSON> (<PERSON>P.J. Soles</PERSON>) who LOVES the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>. Also the head of the school football team (<PERSON>Vincent Van Patten</PERSON>) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute <PERSON>Kate Rambeau</PERSON> (<PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON>) is in love with him.<br /><br />An instant midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.<br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and <PERSON>Woronov</PERSON> (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones...I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fan you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7.
1454 0 I am really shocked that a great director like <PERSON>Chuck Jones</PERSON> started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for <PERSON>Christ</PERSON>'s sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night <PERSON>Elmer</PERSON> (another incredibly boring <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff. Good Night <PERSON>Elmer</PERSON> was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there's too much dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, <PERSON>Elmer</PERSON> finishes eating dinner, and comments, "That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb," possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this.<br /><br /><PERSON>Elmer</PERSON>'s Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to <PERSON>Chuck Jones</PERSON> and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it.
1455 1 One of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just mindless fun. There really were a lot of clever jokes in it. Of course I love the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>. But with all the "anarchy" and the "I hate high school" themes, the film doesn't at all take itself too seriously,which is what's great about it.<br /><br />I first saw the movie in the Spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970's, it made me kind of nostalgic. <br /><br />Like I said, this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies, eighties, and nineties. And to speak of, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rated. That's rare for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule.
1456 0 i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked "Buffet Froid" from this Director (bertrand blier) but the script of "Les Acteurs" is VERY POOR. why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario.
1457 1 The Ramones, whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan (<ORGANIZATION>P.J. Soles</ORGANIZATION>) who faces off against a merciless, joyless principal (<PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>) for the right to rock.<br /><br />Featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and execution. It's chock full of riotous sight gags (like the mouse experiment), teenage spirit (probably my all-time favorite film opening), and bizarre, off-the-wall moments (the straitjacket scenes). If you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level, look no further. But if you're looking for a nice, dignified, dramatic epic, maybe you should look a wee bit further.<br /><br />"Hi everybody, I'm <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON>, and this is <ORGANIZATION>Rock & Roll High School</ORGANIZATION>!"
1458 0 Before starting to watch the show, I've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the scripts are so dumb that I am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what about the <ORGANIZATION>SFX</ORGANIZATION> and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, colors are not saturated they are over saturated, like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated. This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility.
1459 1 I seriously love this film so much, I never get sick of watching it. The only line I really can't stomach in this is when <PERSON>Riff</PERSON> calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of <ORGANIZATION>PJ Soles</ORGANIZATION> and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the Ramones were until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her snarly little face for the most part. Most people who watch this over and over are fans of the Ramones and really.. that's the only reason I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing <PERSON>DeeDee</PERSON> mess up his Pizza lines or <PERSON>Joey</PERSON> mess up the name of the teacher over and over, haha. One of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance , down the halls of the high school.. I love it. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly <ORGANIZATION>PJ Soles</ORGANIZATION> isn't on it. Maybe she was working on another project *laugh* Anyway, great film, even better if you're a <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fan.
1460 0 I have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to. <br /><br />Having just watched it a few hours ago I am struggling to remember a thing about it. <br /><br />From what I remember it's main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from Friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man.<br /><br />Some people die, the film ends, I am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /><br />I will pay u Â£1 to take this film off my hands......oh wait I already gave it away to a "friend".
1461 1 I liked this movie I remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON> (played by <PERSON>P.J. Soles</PERSON>) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> are in the room with her sing the song "I Want You Around" ...very very cool stuff.<br /><br />It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes I'll admit that the ending is way-way over the top and far fetched ...but it doesn't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n <PERSON>Rocll</PERSON> forever<br /><br />I read that Cheap Trick was the band who was originally to star in this ..But I do not know if this is true or not
1462 0 <PERSON>Mike Hawthorne</PERSON>(<PERSON>Gordon Currie</PERSON>)is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>(<PERSON>Jon Fedele</PERSON>). Twenty years later, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> gathers a group of his friends to his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst fears...<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> tries to summon the spirit of his late father. It is soon discovered that <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>'s spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins.<br /><br />Most of the F/X are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme. Stale story pitifully acted. Cast members of note are: <PERSON>Kelly Benson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Phillip Rhys</PERSON>, <PERSON>Emmanuelle Vaugier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Byron Chief-Moon</PERSON> and veteran actress <PERSON>Betsy Palmer</PERSON>.
1463 1 This movie is SOOOO funny!!! The acting is WONDERFUL, the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his/her school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, You will love this film. This movie is a tad bit "grease"esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through. This musical ranks number two in musicals to me (second next to the blues brothers). But please, do not think of it as a musical per say; seeing as how the songs are so likable, it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. I think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance. You will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say, you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film. Highly recommended for both the family (since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience.
1464 0 A young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself. 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't turn out like his father. All the stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the "funny" guy; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses--that's how we know); the nerd and two no-personality blondes. It all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life (don't ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a great opening scene, we jump to 20 years later--ALL bad horror movies do that!<br /><br />The dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except for <PERSON>Betsy Palmer</PERSON>--why <PERSON>Betsy</PERSON>?) and the killings are stupid and/or unimaginative. My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed! A real bad, stupid incoherent horror film. Avoid at all costs.
1465 1 Well, I have finally caught up with "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary "<PERSON>Patti Smith</PERSON>: Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. It tells the story of <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON>, adorably played by <PERSON>P.J. Soles</PERSON>, and the battle that she and her fellow students at <PERSON>Vince Lombardi</PERSON> High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (<PERSON>Danny Peary</PERSON>, in his book "Cult Movies," quite accurately describes <PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>'s performance as an "evil Eve Arden.") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and <PERSON>Gretel</PERSON> hall monitors) and some truly rousing tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment. And the initial appearance of <PERSON>Joey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dee Dee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marky</PERSON> in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's wet dream. Fun stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder....
1466 0 Those of you who, like me, were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn, "The Fear" will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel. It sort of follows a similar plot, but it is impossible to connect to the original, with the exception of the presence of <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>, the mannequin monster made of wood. Here is a brief overview.<br /><br />Twenty years after <PERSON>Mike Hawthorne</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gordon Currie</PERSON>, in a decent performance) witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> is still suffering from the fear of that day. In hopes of ridding his fear, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents' home. His plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears, and then present the fears to the mannequin <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>. According to an Indian friend, this process is supposed to magically take away one's fear. What <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> doesn't know is that <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> is possessed with his father's spirit, and begins killing off the friends...or is it really <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> himself doing the killings? Who cares?<br /><br />A have a few troubles with this film. The first lies with <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>. I thought the original made <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> look rather convincing. This time, it is painfully obvious <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> is a man (actor <PERSON>Jon Fedele</PERSON>) in a fake looking suit. This can especially be seen in early scenes, where <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> is still supposed to be inanimate, but if you watch closely you can see him blinking. Another trouble is that most of the characters don't try hard enough. Some of them do, namely <PERSON>Betsy Palmer</PERSON>, of Friday the 13th fame, who was excellent in this film. But most of them don't make the effort or weren't given the chance. Finally, there are the killings. The opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing. Actually, when I saw them I thought I was in for a good movie. When the second half of the movie arrives, and the killings really start, everything falls to pieces. Deaths are either uncreative, unseen, or foreseen (glimpses of the next scene as <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> has a blackout). One character dies in the end and no one, including the viewer, even notices. While more characterization was needed in the beginning half, it wasn't too bad. The second half was. I think new director <PERSON>Chris Angel</PERSON> got to this point and really didn't know how to shoot the violent scenes, so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian. A silly ending doesn't help either. Thus, unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin, you should probably skip "The Fear 2: Halloween Night." <PERSON>Zanatos</PERSON>' score: 4 out of 10.
1467 1 How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the <PERSON>Dennis Leary</PERSON> joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.
1468 0 This movie was crap with a capital "C." The opening scene showed promise. But that "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going.<br /><br />And the wooden statue, <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>, who was rather creepy in the original film, looks plain goofy in this one. It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (And by the way, who else thinks "Morty" is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth? It ranks right up there with "<PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON>" or "Fred" when it comes to horror value. Or why not just name the wooden statute Henry-freakin'-<PERSON>Kissinger</PERSON>. "Run, it's Dr. <PERSON>Kissinger</PERSON>!" That'd be about as scary as "<PERSON>Morty</PERSON>.)<br /><br />And then there's a scene where the "hero" hits his father's tombstone with---"a sledgehammer?" you might guess--"a two-by-four?" someone might venture. No, he angrily beats his father's tombstone with a twig---a freakin' twig. But worse than that, once the characters walk away, the tombstone actually, and inexplicably, bleeds. Oh brother!<br /><br />There's also a Native American guy who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently, does nothing except Morty-maintenance. He perpetuates creepy Morty-legends, warns those who scoff, and even fixes <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>'s arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank. But for all his respect for and tenderness toward <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>, does <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> give a rat's hairy behind? No.<br /><br />The movie drags on, and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (sort of). This film is a real yawner. Don't rent it.
1469 1 This film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish. The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>, reigning princes of late-70s Punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars as <PERSON>Riff Randle</PERSON>, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the <PERSON>Ramones</PERSON>, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin', and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics.<br /><br />Meanwhile the school that <PERSON>Riff</PERSON> attends, has just hired a brand-new Principal, named Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON>. She's a tall, intimidating <ORGANIZATION>Amazon</ORGANIZATION> of a woman. And she vows to make the students 'toe-the-line'. She even has a couple of the students act as monitors, who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> is especially determined to nab Riff, and put a stop to <PERSON>Riff</PERSON>'s anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn.<br /><br />Kudos to the superb performance of <PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>, in her role as Principal Togar. <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> is a legendary B movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. <PERSON>Togar</PERSON>, with sneering relish. <PERSON>PJ Soles</PERSON> as Riff, turns in an electrifying performance. <PERSON>Clint Howard</PERSON> as the duplicitous Eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role.<br /><br />The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential, in the 70s Punk rock scene. Certainly, this is a good film for Ramones fans. But even if you're not into the Ramones, or Punk rock, this movie is a terrific blast (literally) of energetic fun.
1470 0 Five-year-old <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father "The Highwayman," who later commits suicide. "20 years later" grown <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gordon Currie</PERSON>, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to "master their own fears" at a Halloween night costume party. <PERSON>Morty</PERSON>, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian handyman, becomes possessed by the dead father's spirit and kills them off using their phobias. Characters are thrown out a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, etc. <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> morphs into the dad and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wisecracks. After finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, act cheerful, crack jokes and have sex.<br /><br />The Morty design is good and <PERSON>Betsy Palmer</PERSON> (Mrs. <PERSON>Voorhees</PERSON> from the original Friday THE 13TH) is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares, bad acting, brain-dead characters, repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera-work. Plus the only two minority characters (the Indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. BLAH!
1471 1 Marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of <ORGANIZATION>Vince Lombardi High School</ORGANIZATION> are confronted with a new, dictatorial principal named Miss <PERSON>Togar</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>). Togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions. Leading the charge against her is fun-loving <PERSON>Riff Randell</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>P.J. Soles</ORGANIZATION>), the #1 <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> fan who, more than anything, wants the rock group to record her songs.<br /><br />Now *this* is an impossible movie to resist. First and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON> and the Velvet Underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "<PERSON>Sheena</PERSON> is a Punk Rocker", and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. Next, the cast truly gives it their all, with Soles an ideal choice for the role of Riff; she is a true delight. <PERSON>Vincent Van Patten</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON> are earnest as <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, <PERSON>Woronov</PERSON> is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful <PERSON>Togar</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clint Howard</PERSON> has one of his best ever parts as washroom-occupying entrepreneur <ORGANIZATION>Eaglebauer</ORGANIZATION>, and New World regulars such as <PERSON>Dick Miller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Bartel</PERSON> (particularly fun as music teacher Mr. <PERSON>McGree</PERSON>) and The Real <PERSON>Don Steele</PERSON> are fun as always. And, of course, it's a treat to see The Ramones playing themselves.<br /><br />The movie has true spirit. The energy level is high, with co-story author and director <PERSON>Allan Arkush</PERSON> bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings. There's also a great sense of humor. The paper airplane gag is a superb example of this. This extends right to the "wipe" style of scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable <PERSON>Rob Bottin</PERSON>, in one of his earliest gigs.<br /><br />About as good as an authority-defying, defend-one's-right-to-party film can get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is, quite simply, a wonderful cult film.<br /><br />8/10
1472 0 Twenty years ago, the five years old boy <PERSON>Michael Hawthorne</PERSON> witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later. On the present days, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gordon Currie</PERSON>) invites his girlfriend Peg (<PERSON>Stacy Grant</PERSON>) and his best friends <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> (<PERSON>Myc Agnew</PERSON>), <PERSON>Jennifer</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emmanuelle Vaugier</PERSON>), <PERSON>Lisa Ann</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kelly Benson</PERSON>), <PERSON>Ned</PERSON> (<PERSON>Brendon Beiser</PERSON>), <PERSON>Mitch Maldive</PERSON> (<PERSON>Phillip Rhys</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Trish</PERSON> (<PERSON>Rachel Hayward</PERSON>) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend <PERSON>Crow</PERSON> (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jon Fedele</PERSON>) that would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and <PERSON>Morty</PERSON> turns into his father, killing his friends.<br /><br />"The Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy screenplay full of clichÃ©s. There are some exaggerated performances, like for example Ms. <PERSON>Betsy Palmer</PERSON>; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies. The low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation. In the very end, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story. I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> with 87 minutes running time. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
1473 1 A must for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made The <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> a household name back in the early 1980's (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best of the American Punk Rock movies, with a cult classic status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally the producers wanted Cheap Trick as the stars, but the release of the "Live At <LOCATION>Budakon</LOCATION>" album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie. Very good luck for the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which sadly never happened until after the bands demise). The band, <PERSON>Dee Dee</PERSON> especially, always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION> shows. This movie, like most classics, is stupid fun with some classic Ramones footage in their heyday. Don't expect more, you won't find it. It's great fun, so enjoy it. Another <PERSON>Allan Arkush</PERSON> classic movie in a similar vein is Get Crazy, featuring <PERSON>Lee Ving</PERSON> from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
1474 0 WOW!<br /><br />I just was given this film from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at <ORGANIZATION>Walmart</ORGANIZATION>, and he felt that he got taken! It is beyond boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a script. The Martians are <ORGANIZATION>CGI</ORGANIZATION>, which look like they were done by a novice, or a Fan produced movie. I cannot stress just how bad this DVD really is!<br /><br />Example: In one of the scenes, the martians are torturing a local female captive. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen, to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is totally noticeable, and when she is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, looking like something from a game back in 1990!<br /><br />If at all possible, avoid this movie like the plague! You can download two trailers from their site, and see how god-awful it really is!
1475 1 It's amazing that actress <PERSON>P.J. Soles</PERSON> didn't become a big star after playing <PERSON>Riff Randall</PERSON>, #1 fan of the punk rock group the <ORGANIZATION>Ramones</ORGANIZATION>, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School". Soles is so exuberant, you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school (that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24). The movie is a fast-paced frolic that doesn't cop-out; everything gets blown to smithereens at the end, and that's just as it should be. <PERSON>Mary Woronov</PERSON>, an innately kinky and funny presence as the Nazi-like principal, gets a great, one-of-a-kind bit at the beginning where Frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did they use on that, or was it a fluke?) and <PERSON>Dey Young</PERSON> is very appealing as Soles' best, <PERSON>Kate Rambeau</PERSON>. The weakest link, ironically enough, in this "High School" chain-gang is the Ramones. They can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment goes on too long. One Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare <PERSON>Paul McCartney</PERSON> ballad heard near the beginning ("Did We Meet Somewhere Before?"). Great fun! *** from ****
1476 0 Let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well-loved and well-respected, not to say revered author, in order to draw attention to their home-movies out on DVD.<br /><br />Hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers, in fact lied about only to be revealed, finally, as ludicrously inept in every department, the fans of <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> and of his book have been after the blood of its Writer-Producer-Director since it appeared on DVD.<br /><br />Many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page.

1477 1 And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. No matter how it evolved (at point being a movie about disco), it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out, but the principal stands in their way. Think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50's in which the day is saved when <PERSON>Alan Freed</PERSON> comes to town with <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON> to prove that <ORGANIZATION>Rock & Roll Music</ORGANIZATION> is really cool and safe for the kids, and Tuesday <PERSON>Weld</PERSON> gets a new sweater for the dance. Forward to the 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in DA RAMONES, whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ guest shot, "The Real" <PERSON>Don Steele</PERSON>). Throw in, too, all the elements of a Roger Corman-produced comedy-exploitation film, except for the two-day shooting schedule, some of the familiar <PERSON>Corman</PERSON> repertory players like <PERSON>Clint Howard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Wournow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dick Miller</PERSON> (there since "Bucket of Blood"), and you've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day. One of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive-in, and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk, not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great Ramones footage.
1478 0 <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> and <PERSON>Goforth</PERSON>, the perpetrators of this crime, begin on the wrong foot first step, by assuming that <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> wrote Gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously. That simply isn't true. <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> was very much an inheritor of the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction might leave the British unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad.<br /><br />Two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (I was reminded of <PERSON>Fay Wray</PERSON> in the original <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION>), rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialog reeks of 'Victorianisms' uttered seriously that <PERSON>Welles</PERSON> clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek.<br /><br />All of this looks suspiciously like <PERSON>Ed Wood</PERSON> with an enormous budget to waste on CGI effects - which by the way are so poorly accomplished, the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job. (Gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons, I expected them to float away any minute.) Think The Yellow Submarine as done by the old <ORGANIZATION>EC Comics</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br />Worse yet is the loss of theme, which robs the film of any reason to exist. Although the makers of this film return the story to its Victorian era, they utterly miss the uncanny way Wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact not unnoticed by <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> himself, who, after the war, reworked the theme in The Shape of Things to Come.<br /><br />Without any theme, all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons, when they're not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student's rewrite of <PERSON>Macbeth</PERSON>.<br /><br />Really, this is the worst, most senseless piece of drivel I have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago. That film was so pretentiously dull, my friend and I and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half-way through, and sat near the screen playing cards, using the movie as light by which to see the cards - its only usefulness, as far as any of us could tell.<br /><br />But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I didn't need this put-down of Wells for anything.<br /><br />Do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each and every one of them. God in his wisdom created us just for this purpose.
1479 1 I have been a <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> fan ever since we were both kids, from her <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> years. I loved her tomboy antics in films like Candleshoe.<br /><br />"Foxes" was such a huge departure from all of that.<br /><br />Where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?), <PERSON>Jodie</PERSON> went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction.<br /><br />This was not <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>. This was not <PERSON>Porky</PERSON>'s. This was not "Halloweed". This was a dark & powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Sadly it's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country, this film could be replayed (with a current soundtrack) and still be wholly relevant.<br /><br />It's not the best film ever made, it is tired at some parts, not all the performances are particularly outstanding. But <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> continued to show her chops as a real adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in Taxi Driver).<br /><br />7 out of 10 Barky
1480 0 Well, on it's credit side (if it can be said to have one), <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> DID manage to capture the original setting of <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON>' outstanding novella. But other than that - well, to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime. What the Master <PERSON>Ed Wood</PERSON> could have done with the alleged $20 million dollar budget! <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> really does make Mr. <PERSON>Wood</PERSON>, who was a flawed genius anyway, look like the best filmmaker of all time. The special effects (I guess you'd call them that) are not even up to computer game standards. The acting is, well, perhaps about dinner theater comparable, and the accents are atrocious. At the risk of sounding offensive, a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is (especially <ORGANIZATION>Poor Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>), well, ahem, . . . GAY! <ORGANIZATION>Poor Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION> minces and flounces about the bogus English countryside, waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor. Hey, the Stormtroopers in "Star Wars" had neat white body armor too, and it didn't work either, they still got blasted. Even when <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy and Company</ORGANIZATION> get fried by the Martians' '<PERSON>Heat Ray</PERSON>'(?), they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance, even when they're theoretically DEAD and reduced to skeletons, which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing. Maybe <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> rented the skeletons from <PERSON>Ray Harryhausen</PERSON>, being left over from "<PERSON>Jason</PERSON> And The Argonauts". Or was it "<PERSON>Josie</PERSON> And The Pussycats"? I dunno. The soldiers, presumably because they're 'military', all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode, like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him. Wow! I loved it! But the 'soldiers' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the Spanish Civil War, or <ORGANIZATION>Boer Commandos</ORGANIZATION> (which would be more or less correct for the period. Perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius <PERSON>Hines</PERSON>?). Oddly enough, the character of the Curate looks exactly like he's drawn in the original illustrations by <PERSON>Warwick Goble</PERSON>, and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting. Oh, yeah. Musn't forget the THUNDER CHILD. In the book, the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo-ram. It was MEANT to RAM enemy ships. Yet, it's bow was crumpled after ramming the Tinker-Toy constructed Martian War Machines, with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak, and she sank. An ironclad warship like <ORGANIZATION>THUNDERCHILD</ORGANIZATION> could've rammed the TITANIC and survived, but I guess the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> was bound by the same lowest-bidder constraints as our own Military. The costumes are all wrong, especially the <ORGANIZATION>British Army</ORGANIZATION> and Police uniforms, cobbled together mostly from <ORGANIZATION>USMC Alphas</ORGANIZATION>. And <PERSON>Timbo</PERSON>, in an obvious homage to <ORGANIZATION>Western Films Of Yore</ORGANIZATION>, has obviously set his movie in Wild Western <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, because all his riders are using western saddles. The accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of Scottish regional accent used by Clan Macabre, and magically delicious Irish accents from <LOCATION>County Malarky</LOCATION>. On the credit side, and contrary to what one reviewer wrote, the only genuine, authentic feature of this Thing is the artillery. The guns are not from the Civil War, but appear to my eye and research as bona-fide British nine or 12 pounder Rifled Breach Loaders, perfectly authentic to the period. So was the ammunition shown being used. But the Artilleryman, who is a driver in the Horse Artillery, was not shown correctly driving his limber. You don't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team, you ride the nearside wheel horses. The Opening, using what I believe is authentic period film footage, is okay, and the score's not bad. However, to the best of my knowledge Weybridge has never had an underground, and it certainly didn't in 1898.<br /><br />But growing up reading this novel, I am very disappointed. Even more disappointed then I was at <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s zillion dollar, special effects laden version. Maybe his version would have profited by swapping <PERSON>Anthony Piana</PERSON> for <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON>, and vice versa. I have a lot more to say, but I'll let it go at this for now: I wish somebody would make a GOOD version of "War Of The Worlds" that's faithful to the original. <PERSON>Timmy</PERSON>'s vision is fine for a high school film class, or maybe I should say pretentiously stupid for a college-level film student, and about as bad, which is about the best I can say for this thing, but that's about it. Oh, yeah. Just where DID the budget go? And what happened to <PERSON>Michael Caine</PERSON>? I'd like to hear HIS comments! I have a sneaking suspicion that <PERSON>Timbo</PERSON> "Orson Wood" <PERSON>Hines</PERSON>' breathtaking, bound-breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk-taking director's ticket to cult stardom, because, I must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie, which I didn't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a DVD copy for me, with no malicious intent that I've been able to determine. I must add here that I thought <PERSON>Blackmoon</PERSON>'s dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement, but an absolute, hysterically funny (in a good way) treat to watch. I find it hard to watch Master <PERSON>Timbo</PERSON>'s version after <PERSON>Blackmoon</PERSON>. Keep it up, <PERSON>Tim</PERSON>! Make your own version of "DUNE", now. It just awaits the hand of a master like you! And all you headupyourass snobs who hated <PERSON>Cloverfield</PERSON>? FORGET IT. It CANNOT BEAT <PERSON>TIMBO HINES</PERSON> ARTISTRY FOR SHEER HILARIOUS AWFULNESS! HEY GET A LIFE!TIMBO IS WORSE THAN THE MASTER ED WOOD! I KID YOU NOT!
1481 1 "Foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (<PERSON>Porky</PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION>Fast Times</ORGANIZATION> at Ridgement High), the movie holds up well against time.<br /><br />Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> and sk8er boi <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> (remember him?) lead a fine young cast that's well worth watching.<br /><br />The film follows four <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents. The teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts, or out on the street. Seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill, party, or boy away.<br /><br />But rather than condemning them, the film is sympathetic, blaming absent, uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone. And the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike.<br /><br />The film's opening Â– a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood, from Twinkies to a picture of a young <PERSON>John Travola</PERSON>, while <PERSON>Donna Summer</PERSON>'s "On the Radio" is scored beneath.<br /><br />From there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life. <PERSON>Annie</PERSON> (Runaway rocker <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON>) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. <PERSON>Deirdre</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kandice Stroh</PERSON>) is the boy crazy drama queen. <PERSON>Madge</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marlilyn Stroh</PERSON>) is the shy girl in over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line (<PERSON>Sally Kellerman</PERSON>).<br /><br />It's an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails at.<br /><br />Despite its age, "Foxes" remains a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes, and references to Olympic skater <PERSON>Dorothy Hamill</PERSON> haven't hurt the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is simply stunning, with breathtaking filtered shots of the <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> basin at dawn, dusk and at night. <PERSON>Giorgio Moroder</PERSON> adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of <PERSON>Donna Summer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Janis Ian</PERSON>.<br /><br />Perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the casts of "<ORGANIZATION>St. Elmo</ORGANIZATION>'s Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But perhaps like Bowling for Soup's song "1985," they just hit a wall.
1482 0 I have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty, and I can honestly say I feel violated. I had read the reviews and heard the warnings, and I thought I was prepared for anything - at best I thought, a faithful (if misguided) attempt at an original adaptation; at worst, a so-good-it's-bad "Plan 9" for the new millennium. So when I managed to pick up a copy in <ORGANIZATION>Walmart</ORGANIZATION> while in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and brought it back to the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION>, I joked to my friends "Prepare for the worst movie ever made!" Oh, cruel Karma. There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend this film. The "special" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a Spectrum ZX81. The acting is terrible, the accents are WORSE than terrible (one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the British <LOCATION>Isles</LOCATION>, from <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>), the dialogue is stilted, the editing is non-existent, the production values prove that no expense has been gone to. Words really cannot describe how bad this movie is; from the Union Flag flying from the horribly CGI'd Thunderchild (the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> flies the <LOCATION>White Ensign</LOCATION>, NOT the Union flag) to the woodworm ridden acting, this is quite simply a crime against film making. When you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the 'net (the Star Wars short "Troops" for example), the whole "we're enthusiastic amateurs" argument goes right out of the window. And if you believe an interview with <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> website, this film had an 8 figure budget! I can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. Maybe the problem is that <ORGANIZATION>Hines & co</ORGANIZATION> tried to make a film of the book, rather than turn the book into a film (if that makes any sense). Characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words. Ironically enough, the ONLY person who even came close to giving a decent performance was <PERSON>Darlene Sellers</PERSON>, the ex-soft porn actress. My advice? Pray like crazy that <PERSON>Jeff Wayne</PERSON> doesn't screw up, and go watch the <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> version. It may not be true to the text of the book, but I can say this; As a lifelong HG Wells fan (and Englishman as well) Speilbergs film IS true to the Spirit of the book. Maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country, but I will say this: <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> stole three hours of my life, and I want them back.
1483 1 I was just a bit young for this one, but I had to see it. There's some excellent music, which many folks have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by "Angel", a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit. Wearing their trademark white outfits, they grind through "20th Century Foxes", and apparently all try to cram into the camera's field of vision. Keyboardist <PERSON>Gregg Giuffria</PERSON> remains the bands highlight, and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut, ever! <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON> (ex-Runaways singer) begins a brief, but notable, acting career here, and is quite memorable alongside <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>, and the rest. (Her topless 3-D scenes in "Parasite", and her UFO sighting, in "Wavelength" kept us all watching her for a time). <br /><br />It's not a masterpiece, but it preserves a chunk of its period, for all to gaze upon, and wonder.
1484 0 If this film had a budget of 20 million I'd just like to know where the money went. A monkey could make better CGI effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage, although I must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really, really cool on an original play-station 1 game, and early PC games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made. What puzzles me is where did the money go? <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> circa 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or ruining in this case) for about the same 20 million. This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made! I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again. I hated it completely! I regress. I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew. Shame on you <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> films! I want my money back!
1485 1 Coming of age movies are quite usual these days. For 1980, "Foxes" really gives its meaning. <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> plays her character straight out. Ever since she did "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. She's <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON>, a high schooler who has plenty of guts, and seems to get out of any situation she's in. <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> way before <PERSON>Chachi</PERSON> on "Happy Days". He's deemed immature by the other girls. <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON> is <PERSON>Annie</PERSON>, hangs with the wrong crowd, chased by her policeman father. <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous. <PERSON>Annie</PERSON> is rescued by <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> all the time whenever she gets wasted. Reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident. And one gets married to a much older man. Growing up isn't easy, sometimes we got to explore life how it is. In reality, you got to be careful about the people surrounding you. For me, I was my own person, and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great plot, this movie's a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
1486 0 Holy freaking God all-freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way... The character acting is the poorest thing I've seen in quite some time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO(it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, Come on, really. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without <PERSON>Kevin Sorbo</PERSON> there to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.
1487 1 This work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution. Though this is a broad generalization, parents of that time were too self-absorbed to be real parents, and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues, where their children were concerned. <br /><br />This film teaches us how to let go, even when it is painful, and does so with a sweet, melancholy, but informed style whereby Foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie, actually.<br /><br />The transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on, and so must we. <PERSON>Baio</PERSON>'s skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass, and we are meant to get through them, to better times.<br /><br />The whole metaphor of "moving on," and the procession of life, is present throughout the film, and serves to give us hope, in the end.<br /><br />I like this movie, though I do not watch it often, as it tends to make me melancholy.<br /><br />It shouldn't be viewed by young children, and probably only those raised in the 1970's-80's would want to.<br /><br />It rates a 7.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.

1489 1 "Foxes" is one movie I remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's. As I am exactly <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>'s age, I related to this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships & rebellion of youth. The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg. "More Than a Feeling" by <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by <PERSON>Donna Summer</PERSON>. The music of my late teens. Yep, I'll always remember this one, even if it wasn't huge.
1490 0 I'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I had expected), this movie had all of those qualities. <br /><br />The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> 64. Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> scene, the train wreck... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, though, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done.<br /><br />The acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been, having been based directly on <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON>' book. For having such good source material, it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny. And then there's the mustache... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half the movie contains acting. The rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots.<br /><br />To say that <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes, the bad green screening, it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie. I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie. Bravo, Mr. <PERSON>Hines</PERSON>. Bravo. <br /><br />My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies over, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you'll make it all the way through. It does make for an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster.
1491 1 "Foxes" is a great film. The four young actresses <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marilyn Kagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kandice Stroh</PERSON> are wonderful. The song "On the radio" by <PERSON>Donna Summer</PERSON> is lovely. A great film. *****
1492 0 Save the $8.97 you'll spend at <ORGANIZATION>Walmart</ORGANIZATION> to buy this DVD and go see the real film by <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON>.<br /><br />I'm a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON>, I had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time. It's horrible.<br /><br />There are reports that <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> had a $20 Million budget for this production. Where the heck did it go? Did he use most of it to buy a new house? Finance his retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is actually good about this film. It does stay true to the book AND there are a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible... and I do mean horrible special effects. Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the CGI. To me, most of it looked like "stop action" card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $20 Million project should be using.<br /><br />There's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> created. I've seen films with budgets of less than $2 Million look better. Much better.<br /><br />In my opinion the special effects used in the original <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION> were more sophisticated and better than <PERSON>Hines</PERSON>' special effects in this film. IN fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this film. There's no excuse with today's technology for a film to look like a 50's B-Movie unless that was the intention, which shouldn't have been with this particular project.<br /><br />A problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur film-making.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that I produced a $45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.<br /><br />I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
1493 1 As I reach the "backside" of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed, drug influenced teens of today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. From KISS-posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! <br /><br />Watch for a young <PERSON>Laura Dern</PERSON>. Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I'll never know ? <br /><br />I did have a problem with <PERSON>Randy Quaid</PERSON>'s character deflowering a 16 year old girl. While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house. The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff.<br /><br />Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge, <ORGANIZATION>Fast Times</ORGANIZATION>, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks.<br /><br />I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.
1494 0 Finally i thought someone is going to do justice to <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON>'s classic , not another version set in the wrong locale or era , but one based firmly on the book . Well it definitely follows the book pretty closely , and that is the only plus to this mess.<br /><br />This is 180 Min's (yes 3 hours) long , the book is only around 150 pages .<br /><br />If <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> had the nerve to come on here and say "if you can do any better ..." i would say "yes , i could" and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life.<br /><br />I paid good money to get this crap over to the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> , do not make the same mistake as me .
1495 1 Although I was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school (1996) when I saw it I became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them.<br /><br />Their hair, clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished that they would make movies like that still.<br /><br />In fact I saw this movie the night after I had been at a crazy party (not so unlike the one in <PERSON>Jay</PERSON>'s house) which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd. A world class BS'er and "responsible" mother figure type I identified immediately with <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> (I was also the one with a car) although I had a little bit of <PERSON>Madge</PERSON>'s insecurities floating around in there too. My best friend was a <PERSON>Deidre</PERSON> and her good friend from childhood was our <PERSON>Annie</PERSON>.<br /><br />Watching the scene when <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling <PERSON>Madge</PERSON> how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations I had personally had.<br /><br />Now at the age of 27 I recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth (though none of my friends died). I think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up.
1496 0 I love movies, and I'll watch any movie all the way through, just to give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie I can't watch all the way through. The acting is terribly stale and monotone, the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and.....the long scenes of just...walking!!!! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG!!! I didn't even make it 15 minutes until I fast forwarded the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds", lets name this "War of the Walking Long Distances". This cost 5 million dollars to make! What they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song?<br /><br />Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people. That's hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward.<br /><br />So....like I said, if you are a fan of boring, stale, action-less movies, here is one for you DVD collection. But I didn't write this for you, I wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will HATE this movie. It is not worth your time or money<br /><br />I know this is by the book, but the book isn't that long, and I'm a complete book worm/nerd/geek/whatever, but why? Just get the <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> version, it's not all that good, but it's 10 times better than this!! <br /><br />I give this a BIG, FAT ZERO out of 10.
1497 1 This is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago. It connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered.<br /><br />Clothes and music might have changed over time, but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up-to-dateness. And especially this movie does the job pretty well. Of course it is cheesy at times, but very touching as well.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>'s performance is striking, and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.
1498 0 <ORGANIZATION>Nu Image</ORGANIZATION>, UFO and others produce films for the <ORGANIZATION>SCI FI</ORGANIZATION> channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million.<br /><br />Mr. <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish.<br /><br />It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.<br /><br />Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by <PERSON>P.T. Barnum</PERSON>.
1499 1 This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion, its thought provoking, funny and sad with amazing performances all around!. All the characters are wonderful, and the story is just brilliant!, plus <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON> are simply amazing in this!. The Ending is very powerful, however I won't spoil it for you, and I thought the character development was top notch!, plus you can really relate to all of the characters, especially <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Annie</PERSON>, as you will be rooting for them!, plus I loved how it moved slowly, and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about. I can't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion, and it was funny seeing <PERSON>Randy Quaid</PERSON> in this type of role, plus this is extremely well written and made as well!. One scene that really got to me was when <PERSON>Madge</PERSON>(<PERSON>Marilyn Kagan</PERSON>), is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party, and the film has many surprising moments as well!, plus the dialog is especially excellent. This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time (In my opinion), its thought provoking, funny and sad with amazing performances all around, and i say Go see it immediately!, your bound to love it!. The Direction is fantastic!. <PERSON>Adrian Lyne</PERSON> does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!. The Acting is amazing!. <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> is really cute, and is amazing as always!, she was extremely likable, caring, had a lovable character, was intense in some scenes, was focused, and she and <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON> were the heart of the film as <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Annie</PERSON>!(Foster Rules!!!!!!!). <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON> is way hot, and is amazing here, i really felt sorry for her character, as she had a very likable character that just needed help, she gives a powerful performance, and created a very memorable character she was amazing!. <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> is great as <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> he was really likable, and did his job well i liked him. <PERSON>Randy Quaid</PERSON> is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him. <PERSON>Sally Kellerman</PERSON> is great as the mother i liked her a lot. <PERSON>Marilyn Kagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kandice Stroh</PERSON> are both very good as <PERSON>Madge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deirdre</PERSON>, and did what they had to do well as the other two friends. <PERSON>Laura Dern</PERSON> has a very early role here, as it was cool to see her, not much of a part though. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall go see it immediately, it's an underrated masterpiece!. ***** out of 5
1500 0 After hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is I took the plunge and bought the DVD. That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. <br /><br />Secondly, as many had pointed out from the "trailers", the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-Z 1970's or 1980's quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence, in which the Thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns (which fired but had no visible crew), and torpedo tubes. <br /><br />The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out <LOCATION>Mars</LOCATION> to her in the sky. Well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others it's blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The frame-rate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look.<br /><br />Finally, the acting is overall sub-par. One man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents, even to American ears, are outrageous. <br /><br />In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen <PERSON>Gigli</PERSON> or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> has put out. I would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the IMDb rankings. It's a pity that Mystery Science Theater is not still around.
1501 1 <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON> (the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the Runaways in her remarkably able acting debut), <PERSON>Marilyn Kagan</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Kandice Stroh</PERSON> are uniformly believable, splendid and touching as the titular quartet, who are a tight-knit clique of troubled, fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent, uncaring, self-absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> suburbs. The girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex, drugs, alcohol, commitment, and so on at a tender young age when they're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions. <PERSON>Foster</PERSON>, giving one of her most perceptive, affecting and underrated performances to date, is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; she's especially concerned about the good-hearted, but reckless and self-destructive <PERSON>Currie</PERSON>, whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end.<br /><br />This picture offers a poignant, insightful, often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken, dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath <LOCATION>suburbia</LOCATION>'s neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families: tough, resilient, but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent. <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> ("Fatal Attraction," "Jacob's Ladder") <PERSON>Lyne</PERSON>'s direction is both sturdy and observant while <PERSON>Gerald Ayres</PERSON>' script is somewhat messy and rambling, but overall still accurate in its frank, gritty, unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid's nerve-wrackingly chaotic, capricious and unpredictable everyday life. <PERSON>Leon Bijou</PERSON>'s soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence. <PERSON>Giorgio Moroder</PERSON> arranged the excellent score, which makes particularly effective use of <PERSON>Donna Summer</PERSON>'s elegiac "On the Radio." The top-notch cast includes <PERSON>Sally Kellerman</PERSON> as <PERSON>Foster</PERSON>'s neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> as a sweet skateboarder dude, <PERSON>Randy Quaid</PERSON> as <PERSON>Kagan</PERSON>'s rich older boyfriend, British 60's pop singer <PERSON>Adam Faith</PERSON> as <PERSON>Foster</PERSON>'s feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and <PERSON>Lois Smith</PERSON> as <PERSON>Kagan</PERSON>'s smothering, overprotective mother. Appearing in brief bits are <PERSON>Robert Romanus</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mike Damone</PERSON> "Fast Times at <ORGANIZATION>Richmont</ORGANIZATION> High") as one of <PERSON>Foster</PERSON>'s morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing <PERSON>Laura Dern</PERSON> as an obnoxious party crasher. Achingly authentic, engrossing and deeply moving (<PERSON>Currie</PERSON>'s grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking), "Foxes" is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence.
1502 0 I honestly believe that ANYONE considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure. Like the "films" of <PERSON>Edward Wood</PERSON>, Jr. in the '60s and '70s, this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts, re-editing their films, and reworking their special effects until they finally look right. This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios' pre-screening process. If Mr. <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.<br /><br />Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is "good enough" can truly be. Every performance, every line of dialog, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity. A beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think "At least I accomplished SOMETHING" or "Just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself". This movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out.<br /><br />Critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment "the worst movie ever made".<br /><br />Beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are, and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites. Also, beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay, and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story. Writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think "I can do better than THAT" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really IS to produce even mediocre results.<br /><br />I sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers. Particularly those entering the craft in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment. There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects. The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off. Some can't even come CLOSE to it.
1503 1 This is one of the best <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misconception of it as a teen flick. It has wonderful performances, particularly a fight scene between <PERSON>Jodie</PERSON> and her mother, played by a convincing <PERSON>Sally Kellerman</PERSON>. The three girls that play <PERSON>Jodie</PERSON>'s friends are somewhat amateurish but I do think it is worth seeing.
1504 0 Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS? I suppose not. However many stars IMDb displays this just think zero and you'll get my drift. Director and photographer <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> didn't have much of a budget compared to <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s Herculean effort with the same material (rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made), but that need not be an insurmountable handicap. I've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ("Soldier and Saints" is a recent example). With hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells' novella -- and at fraction of what was spent by <ORGANIZATION>Dreamworks</ORGANIZATION> on its "War of the Worlds". Unfortunately, <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> failed in all these departments. Even if he had had <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s budget and <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON> signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he's foisted on us.<br /><br />Primarily, <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> seems unable to tell a story. Thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound, but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records. A guy walks down a country lane, a lot. He talks badly aped Received English to some other guy. Then he walks down the same lane, only shot from the back this time to show he's returning -- clever, eh? Walking and talking, for nearly an hour that's all that happens. OK, I'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character's house to the impact site on <ORGANIZATION>Horsell Common</ORGANIZATION> to show that it's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful (a first-year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this, btw), but half a dozen times? Back and forth, back and forth, et cetera, et cetera with some yakkity-yak in between. Remarkable. The only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish CG works into something that could be offered as a feature-length film. Finally the Martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking, or shrieking. Later we get staggering and wailing for dessert.<br /><br />Thankfully, much of the dialogue is lifted straight from <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON>' text; else we'd have no idea what is going on. But is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text, to realize what words alone can't convey? If a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel, why bother? Why not do a radio play? <LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION> made himself a household name doing just that. However, <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> thinks he's a filmmaker, so he's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning.<br /><br />Secondly, <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> was able to buy some CG effects of a sort for his movie, but he has no idea how to use them. Now I for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy. I believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects. Some really potent Sci-Fi's have flourished on virtually none at all. But "The War of the Worlds" as film requires a certain baseline effort. <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled. The effects don't need to be complex; they can even be crude (e.g. fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the George Pal/Byron Haskins 1953 version), but they must be handled well. Unfortunately <PERSON>Hines</PERSON>' effects are both crude and incompetent Â– tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum Â– Martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort Â– skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream -- the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times (flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice) Â– and on ad nauseum. Crude technique is forgivable. So you have a CG fire effect that's less than convincing? Fine, we can work around that. Just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it. That stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum? Throw it away. It's not necessary. You say your Martian flyer looks like a toy on a string? If you must use it, go ahead, but please don't show it twice! But no, <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> won't listen. We get the worst looking stuff used again and again. Gotta get those 180 minutes somehow, boy.<br /><br />Next we have acting, or more precisely too much acting. Whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out. Evidently <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> thinks he's getting a bargain -- More fleeing in terror over there! You, quaking behind that tree, let's have a real conniption fit this take. You call that writhing in agony? Nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better -- Nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink. They aren't even good amateurs. But this needn't prove fatal. Many a good movie has been made with rancid acting. That's what directors are for. And editors. Which brings up another pointÂ… Who the hell let <PERSON>Tim Hines</PERSON> edit this cheese factory? If <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s butchers were as adept at meat cutting as <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef. In spite of the near three-hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie -- not sequences, but single frames, creating a herky-jerky effect that's nauseating to watch. Maybe <PERSON>Hines</PERSON> intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890's. If he was I can say he doesn't know how to do it.
1505 1 Four teenage girls in a suburb of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. Slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. THAT precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is unfortunately tampered with. Did we really need a long sequence with <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence--also with <PERSON>Baio</PERSON>--where <PERSON>Foster</PERSON> has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and I didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And <PERSON>Jodie</PERSON>'s face at the ending speaks volumes. If viewers do get choked up at the end, the movie has earned this. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****
1506 0 Wow...<br /><br />I picked this up at the local <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time, and just had to buy the film.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing, or lack thereof. Time and again, characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor, but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow...<br /><br />I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even <ORGANIZATION>ILM</ORGANIZATION> still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star <PERSON>Anthony Piana</PERSON> without his distracting mustache). Not since <LOCATION>GETTYSBURG</LOCATION> have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Why <PERSON>Timothy Hines</PERSON> talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while.
1507 1 Story about four teenage girls growing up in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Jeanie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (<PERSON>Sally Kellerman</PERSON>). <PERSON>Annie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Cherie Currie</PERSON>) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. <PERSON>Madge</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marilyn Kagan</PERSON>) has overprotective parents. <PERSON>Deirde</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kandice Stroh</PERSON>) thinks she's more mature than the rest of them.<br /><br />This is nothing new from what we've seen plenty of times before--but this one has one big difference--it's accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes down completely right. Even the main song of the movie ("On the Radio" by <PERSON>Donna Summer</PERSON>) was a big hit before this came out. This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were just like this! The film is (of course) dated but it captures a time we will never see again.<br /><br />The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance. The relationship between her and <PERSON>Kellerman</PERSON> (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done. Even <PERSON>Scott Baio</PERSON> (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy.<br /><br />A very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. The film has a deserved R rating (plenty of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens. I give it a 8.
1508 0 I must admit I burst out laughing when I saw one reviewer compare this to LOTR. Well yes, if you exclude the dwarfs, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If <PERSON>Mr Piano</PERSON> had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a $20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.<br /><br />As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.<br /><br />I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk dogs?
1509 1 If you weren't there, then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. Which as I say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish, it is meant to be for realism. Let's face it--in real life, we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way, even when we mean to. In this sense, it works. This, however, does not apply to our "known" actors in this film, notably <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON> (born a natural). The fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story--<PERSON>Jodie</PERSON> plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close, even with the obvious feeling of fatality. Meaning that no matter how close friends are, eventually there are some people that just fade away, no matter how you try.<br /><br />And therein is the core of the movie. It's not about partying, it's not about sexuality, but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone.<br /><br />If you have ever had a friendship like that in your life, you will feel this movie--it will mean a lot to you, no matter what era it is set in, or what era you grew up in. We all knew these girls in school, or at the very least knew of them. We all knew the frustrated virgin, half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her. We all knew the boy-crazy one, the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world, her fear of acceptance. We all knew the party girl, the one they whispered about, with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits. And we all knew the "mother figure", the one a little more real, a little more grounded, a little more sad because she knew what would happen. Maybe you were one of those girls. Maybe, like me, you had been each one at one time or another...<br /><br />This film really captures that fragile time in life when want, needs, pressures, womanhood, childhood, the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female's head, each factor on the precipice. Which aspect do you hang on to? What do you toss over the edge, no matter how you may want to hold on? And how painful is goodbye to everything you've known? That's what this movie is--steps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood, and how damn tough it is to keep walking. If you were there, you know...and love this film, as I do. Aching and tenderly done. A fine piece of captured femininity.
1510 0 I am currently sitting here, forcing myself to finish this. I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for "War of the Worlds" cause of the rumors of the <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> movie at the time, and I missed the old TV series from the early 90's. The website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book. It was going to be a "perfect translation". Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.<br /><br />First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar. The acting made Shatners classic "dramatic pause" look damn near Shakespearean in quality. The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old <PERSON>Dukes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hazardd</LOCATION> scenes.<br /><br />Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien. After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid. I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm. The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's. The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's NO ONE is concerned for their life. It's like they have no concept. Even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. The "illusion" of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion. THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the "hero" gallop around or walk down silly roads. Get on with the film. I know how people get around, you do NOT need to be so in-depth.<br /><br />Now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. Mighty <ORGANIZATION>Morphin Power Rangers</ORGANIZATION> had better looking effects. Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks, if you want "The War of the Worlds", do one of four things. 1) Watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's TV series, 3) wait for <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s rendition to be released shortly, OR 4) Read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary English class). AVOID THIS MOVIE. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.
1511 1 Dirty <PERSON>Sanchez</PERSON> is the more extreme, British version of Jackass in which the four boys (<PERSON>Pritchard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dainton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joycey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pancho</PERSON>) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason this show is better than Jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny. There are 3 series of the show, the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg. there's an episode on their love lives,jobs etc. The second series sends the boys to try out different occupations. The third follows their European tour. It seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series. In my opinion the third series is the best, but trust me when i say, if you have a week stomach DO NOT WATCH, as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode.
1512 0 Normally when I write a review for a movie online, it is for one of three reasons. Either, I have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, I feel that the public's perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or I believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. While all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, I find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as, "This is one of the best films of all time!", does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. With that being said, War of the Worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggy-backing its loathsome carcass on the multi-million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON>. Many people will buy this DVD in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. This movie is not even "so bad" that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. Now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than I. <br /><br />Judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film (I found it as SAM's Club for 8 bucks), I assumed that the cast would be no-names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular. Check. This is not a big deal for me, as I find a large budget and an over-reliance on big name stars and SE can diminish an otherwise decent movie. I also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score. Check again. What I did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien/battle scenes. <br /><br />Now, as per IMDb's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. The movie opens with a lot of inane small-talk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. Seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. It is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camera-work, spliced scenes, and a LOT of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. However, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. The next 30 minutes basically go as follows: one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. They both walk back to town. These walks aren't two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. They are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. In a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says "Thank you Mary" to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. I apologize for the extreme run-on sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. Characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere. The editing is mind-bogglingly bad. People actions make little sense. For instance, when the professor goes to a farmer's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. When the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. Nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. The entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. I have seen better high school video productions. Finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. I get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. However, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. Avoid this film at all costs.
1513 1 I have to say although I despise these kind of shows, shock horror, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I had seen Dirty <PERSON>Sanchez</PERSON> before I saw Jackass and think it way surpasses Jackass in terms of programme making. Story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of Jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was, everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything. It must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever, shockingly amateur. While drinking puke isn't really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment show goes, <PERSON>Dirty Sanchez</PERSON> is way out of Jackass's league.
1514 0 My children watch the show everyday that its on. Its a great program for younger children. However they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Deedee</PERSON>'s YELLOW TEETH. <PERSON>Moe</PERSON> is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth? Does the show ever make its way to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and if so where can we find its schedule at. And one other thing if we might be able to add. <PERSON>Moe</PERSON> you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope? What does that signify? other then getting wet all the time. They need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole. Kids loose interest that way.
1515 1 I need to be honest. I watched and enjoy this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious, and raunchy. Yeah, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. If you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards, for example then you will have a great time for it.<br /><br />Or, if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad, you will also have a great time. And if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh , you will enjoy the show.<br /><br />I enjoy all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" offers. I like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So if you are tired of the typical American stupidity of Jackass, give it a try to English extreme stupidity on this show. With all due respect.<br /><br />This is a show that has little taste or class. It's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out.<br /><br />Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Specially the <PERSON>Paco</PERSON> character.
1516 0 This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? No. the <PERSON>Doodlebops</PERSON> sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.<br /><br />Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />The show is also extremely cheesy. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's overkill.<br /><br />For kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. They'll never know how to grow up.
1517 1 I knew about this as a similar programme as Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. Basically three Welsh guys, and one mad British bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding, and a complete disregard/masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves. Starring <PERSON>Matthew Pritchard</PERSON> who does pretty much anything, <PERSON>Lee Dainton</PERSON> also up for just about anything, <PERSON>Dan Joyce</PERSON> (the British one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a OTT laugh, and <PERSON>Pancho</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mike Locke</PERSON>) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was number something on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!
1518 0 Most definitely the worst Columbo ever dreamt up. No murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag. <PERSON>Falk</PERSON> looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this.
1519 1 To many people, Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> is living in <LOCATION>NY</LOCATION> in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning. His a crew member of "Beat Street" -a b-boy crew. The movie follows <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> in his average day, dancing, graffitiing, etc.<br /><br />The director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie has old school features such as<br /><br />Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster <PERSON>Melle Mel</PERSON> & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the <LOCATION>New York City Breakers</LOCATION>, and many more....<br /><br />Neither the movie Beat Street nor the Beat Street spirit will ever die.
1520 0 An uninspired and undistinguished "new" Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates...<br /><br />And that it is about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script, given that it is written by <PERSON>Robert Van Scoyk</PERSON>, who penned the highly enjoyable <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> story "Murder Under Glass" in the detective's heyday; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding, which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />Devoid of every Columbo trait possible, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series, with appropriately soap-opera style acting. Very avoidable stuff.
1521 1 I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin'", but I have to say that "Breakin' 1&2" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I will keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon.
1522 0 Absolute garbage. The reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /><br />The supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - it was just routine police work. Utterly tedious.<br /><br />You sat right till the end hoping for a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /><br />There was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap. Could the <ORGANIZATION>Lt</ORGANIZATION>'s personal involvement finally cloud his judgement? <br /><br />All the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it. But surely a genius like Lt C, by constant conversation with the wronged husband, would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
1523 1 I just wanna say that amongst all the so-called classic hiphop films Ive seen like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin', Style Wars etc... IMO BEAT STREET is the best amongst the others. Whenever I ask other people about which is their fave, then it seems that BEAT STREET pops out the most. But still, its the lowest ranked of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (If say, 5 points is the belt). I love the music performances, the breakdancing makes me wanna spin, <ORGANIZATION>RAMO</ORGANIZATION> makes me wanna throw a piece...c'mon, its a classic!!!
1524 0 Loyalty to <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the (1) it deserved. (For that matter, loyalty to Mr. <PERSON>Falk</PERSON> was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails.) Even if you forgive all the glaring errors, this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made-for-TV "Columbo" film ever. I'm glad I watched it on TV for free; would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print.
1525 1 I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a "MC Santa Claus".<br /><br />Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.<br /><br />Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.
1526 0 I love <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot. A mind-bogglingly tedious, pointless, muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored-looking <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON>. The 'plot', such as it is, just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with. One part of the proceedings which I found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON>'s character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON>'s first name a secret, why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous? Like I said, this is the pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.
1527 1 This movie changed it all for me...I heard of breakdancing and hiphop, but had never seen it professionally done (hey I was an 11-year old kid from <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>!) When I saw this movie, this all changed. I got actively involved in the hiphop-movement in our city, started breakdancing and writing lyrics.<br /><br />To this day, I still consider this movie to be a personal favorite. Sure, the filming and "cinematographic" importance might not be that significant. But who cares if the wide-shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody? It's what it does to you personally that counts...
1528 0 The script for this Columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera. Deeply character-driven films are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel. The villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist. The great Lt. <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> himself is no where near his famous, lovable, self-effacing, crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!! I could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would have at least TRIED to struggle or fight back at least a little. And speaking of reality....the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police. The POLICE?? Give me a break. Everyone knows the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> takes over EVERY kidnapping case. This was NO Columbo, just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar Lt. <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> written in and stretched to 2 hours.
1529 1 Without doubt Beat Street is the best film about the breakin scene. Everything about it is spot on,the clothes (puma),the music and most importantly the dancing! The storyline is basic,but hey whats there to tell a story about? The whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing,what mattered to them. It shows that teenagers in general are good,all that mattered to these everyday kids was music,dancing and friendship. Having watched the DVD recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time! The clothes didn't look dated (possibly because <ORGANIZATION>Puma</ORGANIZATION> is now having a massive comeback),the music still sounds fresh,and the dancing is still captivating to watch. A film anyone 10-25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture.
1530 0 Seriously what were they thinking? Over the course of years the Columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it. This movie is basically very different from any other Columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie.<br /><br />Main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other Columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed. The entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the Columbo character in a totally different environment and situation. Also the overall is just totally different and more 'modernized'.<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Alan J. Levi</PERSON> did some other Columbo movies in the past, which all very much sticked to the usual formula. It also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie.<br /><br />The Columbo character himself also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding. The absence of some good relieving and trademark Columbo humor also doesn't exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch.<br /><br />In all honesty, the movie doesn't begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses. It's such a stupid written kidnap-thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely. It also makes the movie more and more unwatchable. This is a very little interesting Columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way.<br /><br />It also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented ones around. Despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style, <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie. Can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him? It would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie I can tell you.<br /><br />An odd Columbo entry, which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula.<br /><br />4/10
1531 1 I guess when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that could rival "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings.<br /><br />The break-dance scenes in "Beat Street" come just before the middle and at the end of the flick. And I loved all of them. Almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the head spins, the suicide sit, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward flip, the figure four---almost everything.<br /><br />Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world...but in a much less violent way than the former. The only major fight scene in "Beat Street" was when graffiti artist <PERSON>Ramon</PERSON> (which in the movie was abbreviated as "Ramo") is chased by a rival gang member on the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail. Well, although that chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot.<br /><br />Most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture, and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. Even the theme song of the movie, which closed the curtain to the flick, was not just an homage to hip-hop culture--it also was an homage to the death of <PERSON>Ramon</PERSON>.<br /><br />By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress <PERSON>Rae Dawn Chong</PERSON> was <PERSON>Sheila E.</PERSON> making a cameo appearance.
1532 0 Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, Columbo smokes out killer, <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> becomes a pest in the process), the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme, and the result is a major flop.<br /><br /> Would you believe: <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> never faces the villain till the very end?!!<br /><br />Frankly, I was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through.<br /><br /> Oh, the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make!!!
1533 1 This started out to be a movie about the street culture of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. What it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life, for American youth. What other movie has done this except Rebel Without A Cause? One of the most important movies of all time. The elements are simple yet fascinating. The story is timeless, young people try to succeed against all odds. Yet the story is always believable and never depressing. The characters are so realistic, a city dweller, would recognize them as neighbors. The story is entertaining, and comes to a satisfying ending. Buy this one for your permanent collection. It is a piece of American history.
1534 0 This should not have been listed as a <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION> because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION> ever made. This should have been listed as a movie starring <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> and not playing the caracter of <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION> because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION>.
1535 1 Being that I am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation, this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as Wild Style, is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/DJ-based music and electro-club culture.<br /><br />Although I will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy, you can't help but feel for the characters, and ultimately "wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-life, real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan's archives as any classic album. Watch some of the breakers' moves in slow-motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned B-boy/B-girl. All praises due to the Zulu Nation!!!
1536 0 I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective.<br /><br />There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First, I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would've been "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Second, <PERSON>Columbo</PERSON> hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it.<br /><br />I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> went back to the usual Columbo.<br /><br />
1537 1 Cinematically, this film stinks. So does a lot of the acting. But I<br /><br />don't care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80's were<br /><br />like(For a lot of us in the innercity anyways) and what hip-hop, Zulu<br /><br />nation, and break dancing were really like.Great music, great<br /><br />dancing! It almost seems like a documentary of a time now past<br /><br />when hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see <LOCATION>New<br /><br />York</LOCATION> looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewers<br /><br />may be too young to remember that It was a poor, run down city<br /><br />during the 70's and 80's. This is the best of all the hip-hop/break<br /><br />dancing movies that came out around that period. Of course the<br /><br />80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and<br /><br />movies, but those of us who lived through it will always remember<br /><br />it fondly for a time when music, dancing, and graffiti were fresh, yo!
1538 0 The major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of Macbeth. Hearing <PERSON>David Lansbury</PERSON>'s soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role. I kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a bigger name was available. Then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast, misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations. Sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works)that they settle for less. This appears to be such an example.
1539 1 Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 film Beat Street is unquestionably the best one. The story follows a DJ, his younger breakdancing brother, a graffiti artist and a wanna-be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The acting isn't always up to par and the characters aren't fully drawn out, but they are more than compensated for by down-to-earth dialogue, a plausible story, fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip-hop sound track. It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ("This ain't <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, this is the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>!"), and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing, dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper <PERSON>Afrika Bambaata</PERSON>. Rock Steady Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80's, the Roxy. A must see for hip-hop lovers.
1540 0 The stranger <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> (<PERSON>Matthew Lillard</PERSON>) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques <PERSON>Max</PERSON> (<PERSON>Vincent D'Onofrio</PERSON>) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> (<PERSON>Valeria Golino</PERSON>) that he is <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s brother. <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> does not buy his story, dominates <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and ties him up to a chair. When <PERSON>Max</PERSON> arrives, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "Spanish Judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. <PERSON>Max</PERSON> invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (<PERSON>Mark Boone Junior</PERSON>), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from <LOCATION>Mars</LOCATION>, to compose the backup team. However, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> and Piece.<br /><br />The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. <PERSON>Valeria Golino</PERSON> is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor <PERSON>Vincent D'Onofrio</PERSON>, they are not able to save the stupid story. Further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
1541 1 I love <PERSON>Tudor Chirila</PERSON> and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much. Two days before the movie premiere I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I had it all figured.. i was wrong: instead of a good movie i assisted a great one! i FELT the movie. it was sad.. it was funny.. but most of all it pictured LOVE.. I can't even begin to describe the soundtrack.. so i won't :) I'm not a movie critic.. I can't describe it in more words.. My kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless.. thank god for the keyboard :) Thank you <PERSON>Tudor Giurgiu</PERSON>, thank you <PERSON>Maria Popistasu</PERSON>, thank you <PERSON>Ioana Barbu</PERSON> and THANK YOU TUDOR <ORGANIZATION>CHIRILA</ORGANIZATION>. Encore! :)
1542 0 Although the director tried(the filming was made in <LOCATION>Tynisia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Morocco</LOCATION>),this attempt to transport the New Testament in the screen failed.The script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies,while the duration is very long.But the most tragic is the protagonist <PERSON>Chris Sarandon</PERSON>,who doesn't seem to understand the demands of his role.
1543 1 I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were <ORGANIZATION>Tudor Chirila</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Maria Popistasu</PERSON>. Yes, I do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. I applaud <PERSON>Puya</PERSON>'s entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor.<br /><br />The wife loved the movie, though, and I think there might have been chords being played and to which I had no ear for. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it should have gotten the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian).
1544 0 This movie is not as good as all the movies of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> I've ever seen. And I'm quite amazed that in this story <ORGANIZATION>Pilate</ORGANIZATION> wants to finish <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON>, when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. It lacks also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> says in one of his letters "If <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> entered <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>. <br /><br />Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact, he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said, God become a man) that indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about <PERSON>Flavius Josephus</PERSON>, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century.
1545 1 Love is overwhelming... In all it's manifestations... Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous... <ORGANIZATION>Tudor Chirila</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Maria Popistasu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ioana Barbu</PERSON>, one truly dramatic story about love in all it's shapes, a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts, about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of <LOCATION>Tudor Giurgiu</LOCATION>. With a magnificent soundtrack featuring Faultline & <PERSON>Chris Martin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vama Veche</PERSON> it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love... Truly remarkable... Is it me or is Romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect? This is a brilliant film... Two thumbs up to everybody involved.
1546 0 No, not the administration of <ORGANIZATION>GWB</ORGANIZATION>, the Decider/Strutter/Smirker--but the mini-series "Monarch Cove." Lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time, most of them broadcast between 11 p.m. Friday nights and 1 a.m. Saturday mornings. As to why I watched the whole thing, I can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism.<br /><br />Most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are <PERSON>Shirley Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rachel Ward</PERSON>, who turn in the only decent performances (<PERSON>Jones</PERSON> doesn't make it through the entire series--lucky woman). <PERSON>Ward</PERSON>, by the way, is aging quite well since her "Thorn Birds" days.<br /><br />The one main thread to the plot--who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of Dad's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer--is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won't especially care who dun it. There is a great deal of "steamy" sex, several murders, and all sorts of rude behavior--virtually none of which is either interesting or credible. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. The writing and direction is on a par with the cast.<br /><br />If you stick around to the end, the post card is a (very minor)hoot.<br /><br />CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!
1547 1 i expected something different:more passion,drama...Again another failed attempt of originality.i'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clichÃ© of 'cheesiness'.15 year old teens may appreciate it though.The acting was not very convincing and the lines common,lacking any wit.Still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted.I can't say that this movie is a total flop,because people do watch it but it didn't meet the public's expectations and sunk into mediocrity.So,to conclude,the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half,which is an appreciable thing.Thus,I guess its worth seeing if you don't get annoyed
1548 0 This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this film, I saw it for <PERSON>John Candy</PERSON> and assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat, unfunny moments. And, to top it off, Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time. So, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, though teens will probably find a few laughs. It's really a shame--it could have been so much better. I mean, with <PERSON>Eugene Levy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe Flaherty</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Candy</PERSON> it SHOULD have been wonderful.
1549 1 i think it is a nice movie; i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere; i think it was not intended to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a purpose); i think it is very natural; i think it is humane; i think it was interesting; i think the actors never made me think... waw lame acting (they are not <PERSON>Sean Connory</PERSON> & co) neither is the film a block buster, they are like the movie... normal ppl that can act...; i think the movie reached its intention; i think it made me feel things (or feel them again :) ); i think i'm not objective;<br /><br />i really enjoyed it... that i know.
1550 0 <ORGANIZATION>John Candy</ORGANIZATION>. Need we say more? He is the main reason you should see this film. Most people don't realize how gifted he was as an actor. Witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk. Just a simple(subtle) facial change and off we go. There are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when <PERSON>John</PERSON>(in a trance) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend-that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude. It is, but it is also very funny mainly because it is <PERSON>John Candy</PERSON> doing this bit. The story in general is pretty lame and <PERSON>Eugene Levy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Flaherty</PERSON>(both SCTV alumni with Candy) are not given enough to do in the film. <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> has his moments, especially filming the wedding at the end(think <PERSON>Rod Serling</PERSON>) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.
1551 1 It's a strange, yet somehow impressive story, about love. Personnaly, I never run over such a twist-off story in real life. But, I can image there is.<br /><br />It's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But, after I watch it, I didn't get this feeling of "sickness" which I would surely have regarding society rules. It's something beautiful in this movie... something impressive...which I cannot contradict using any moral or society rules.<br /><br />The movie focuses mostly on relation between <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON> and Alex. You can see how this relation starts, evolves and finally ends. You feel the moment when this love blossoms, the first whispers, touchings. You feel the connection. And no moment I though this is immoral. You even hope it will not break in the end....it cannot break...it's not right. You feel the pain of being hart broken in the end...<br /><br />But,I need also to add a negative spin to this comment...I don't know if the story is not somehow *showed* to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form, but not in content. You don't have the total story, but only fragments. When movie has started, the relation between <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sandu</PERSON> was already in place. So, no clue about the nature of the relation. You feel only a tension between them...a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation. I think this line of <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON> to <PERSON>Sandu</PERSON> says all: "I want to stop...and if you love me, you will do as I ask you".<br /><br />This movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral...and where's the limit between them. I don't know if the idea of this movie is "love conquers all...even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful...no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think...
1552 0 I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall. I remember that it really sucked. The plot had no sense. I hated the fox that became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! <PERSON>Casper</PERSON> cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part and I don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end. I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he had stayed dead. I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it. No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall. If you have a child don't let them watch this. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
1553 1 I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second, as someone else wrote in a comment, the implications of this kind of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in the romanian society.<br /><br />so... to begin with the second aspect... to make it short, it wasn't visible at all...<br /><br />as for the first.. as i said, it had much more potential... i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension... much more tension... and the potential tension didn't get through...<br /><br />i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme (wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments)... yeah... i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack..<br /><br />the actors... i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10... not enough sensuality in the key moments...<br /><br />a total of 7/10.... mostly for the story
1554 0 I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art. This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.
1555 1 I saw this film at the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Reeling film festival. To pick up on the previous reviewer's remarks, the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is I sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space, drab architecture, overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in Eastern and <LOCATION>Central Europe</LOCATION>. A bit shabby housing project style is how I'd describe it, and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities. I can't say that I'm familiar with <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> where the action unfolded, but I have visited and lived in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> for six months. <br /><br />When I visited <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> as a student for a semester, my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building, just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman, because the elevators weren't working. But, I do concur with the reviewer, that the claustrophobia and muted colors, it's overdone, for there are, to be sure, beautiful historic buildings, parks, squares you can find in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> or in any historic city center of <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>'s didn't get much of any footage in this film. For me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that I would feel during my half-year stay there, feeling trapped and limited. (It makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life, just as people if hope to escape from a <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> urban ghetto.) <br /><br />Also, given the climate of homophobia, say, circa, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in the 1980s, the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter; hence, the focus on their interaction in the apartment.<br /><br />It's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, and I find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing. It's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film, and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources. The actors were fairly good and believable; the dialog was overall well done, and I could identity with these women.<br /><br />The film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women, <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>, an energetic, fun-loving free spirit with a dark, troubling secret (her admiration and love for an abusive, incestuous brother, <PERSON>Sandu</PERSON>) falls in love with <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>, a bright, bookish, idealistic young woman who moves to <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> to begin her college studies. Opposites attract, and their personalities seem to complement one another, though there is some tension between the ambitious, studious, intellectual <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>, who seems to be attending college to please her parents. Keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable, though we don't get any sense of the tension it requires, nor do we ever see or meet any other students--hard to believe--and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed. The chief threat to their love is <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>'s brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him. But <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>'s love for <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond, or does it? That's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops, and I won't say how it concludes.<br /><br />Ironically, <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON>'s love "sickness" isn't love for another woman, but her illicit, incestuous love for her brother. Thus, loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling. <br /><br />Though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic, overly confined to interactions between <PERSON>Kiki</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>, it was still engaging and moving to watch, so I'll give it a 7.
1556 0 What has <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This movie begins like a primer for film students on Irish cinematic cliches: unctuous priests, spitting before handshakes, town square cattle marts, cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music. Quickly, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big Daddy-O of Irish Cliches - religous strife. It concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic-fathered child is educated, which would seem like a reasonable enough wish, though not to the '50's <LOCATION>County Wexford</LOCATION> villagers she has to live with. Rather than send them to a <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> school, she decides to up and leave for <LOCATION>Belfast</LOCATION>, then <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, where a few more cliches are reguritated. While she's there, her father (who looks eerily like <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON>) and family back home are subjected to a boycott, which turns very nasty. I'm not going to give away the ending, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life. The villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to, but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it. In addition, it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION> peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she "must lay down preconditions" for her return. The film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively, and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches, in the past.
1557 1 I'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details, but this movie just hit me deep. I don't think I'll ever forget it. One scene especially (I think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one I am speaking) is imprinted on my brain.<br /><br />I also watched the similar movie Lilja 4-ever (as referred to by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not quite as straight to the point and brutal. If you are sensitive at all, either will bring tears to your eyes, but <PERSON>Anjos</PERSON> Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) may stay with you forever.<br /><br />This is very depressing subject matter, but I think, no, I HOPE that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it.<br /><br />More people need to see this film!!!!!!
1558 0 Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching the show I thought it was good. But the plots just got worse. The storyline were either too boring or predictable. <PERSON>George</PERSON> isn't always funny, he sometimes acts stupid. His jokes are overdone. His mom is the silliest character of the show. How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was the daughter in law, but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. The actors <PERSON>Constance Marie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Masiela Lusha</PERSON> do a great job. Don't know how these shows get to play for so long. <br /><br />If you're really bored like I was and have nothing else to watch, I'd suggest you watch this.
1559 1 In Northeastern of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, the father of the twelve years old illiterate <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> (<PERSON>Fernanda Carvalho</PERSON>) sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization, <PERSON>Tadeu</PERSON> (<PERSON>Chico Dias</PERSON>), to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer LourenÃ§o (OtÃ¡vio Augusto) that deflowers her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in <LOCATION>Amazonas</LOCATION> and explored his owner, the despicable <PERSON>Saraiva</PERSON> (<PERSON>Antonio Calloni</PERSON>). When <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> escapes to <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION> expecting a better life, she is explored by the cÃ¡ften Vera (<PERSON>Darlene</PERSON> GlÃ³ria).<br /><br />"Anjos do Sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> through the fate of the girl <PERSON>Maria</PERSON>. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" that tells an identical story in the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>; therefore this problem does exist in Third World countries. Director and writer <PERSON>Rudi Lagemann</PERSON> presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of the promising <PERSON>Fernanda Carvalho</PERSON>, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival. Most of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous <PERSON>Darlene</PERSON> GlÃ³ria so different she is after many plastic surgeries. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
1560 0 This show is awful. How is <PERSON>George</PERSON> wanting the death of his mother funny? This show is terrible. The parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat. <PERSON>George</PERSON> isn't funny, especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of Spanglish. <PERSON>Ernie</PERSON> is a loser, but at least I've chuckled at him a few times, but mainly at how pathetic he is. <PERSON>George</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Benny</PERSON>, in an awful, despicable character. Sure, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated <PERSON>George</PERSON> as a baby is beyond me.<br /><br />Can someone explain to me how <PERSON>George</PERSON>'s head being big is funny? It's not even that big! I've moved on from characters because they're too awful and it would take hours for me to write and I, frankly, don't care enough. I do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show, that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom, and is not worth your time.<br /><br />I give it 2 starts, because the wife is extremely attractive.
1561 1 I think the weighted average for this film is too low. I give it a 7. Very entertaining, although over the top in a few places. My wife says it passes the <PERSON>Danielle Steele</PERSON> test. Superb performances throughout, particularly by <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION>.
1562 0 This show was absolutely terrible. For one <PERSON>George</PERSON> isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. He also treats his mother with no respect. As a Hispanic, I am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Plus the dysfunctional family thing's been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air, but sadly, we're going to have to stomach this until they "jump the shark".<br /><br />In my opinion, they already did.
1563 1 "Crush" examines female friendship, for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme (e. g., "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The events depicted were highly improbable, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me. Not a film for the speeding-vehicle-and-explosion crowd, but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears.
1564 0 Outside of the fact that <PERSON>George Lopez</PERSON> is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible.<br /><br />Nothing about <PERSON>Lopez</PERSON> has ever been funny. I have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.<br /><br />His stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a grudge that won't end.<br /><br />I feel bad for Hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />The shows plots are always cookie cutter with an Hispanic accent.<br /><br />Canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes.<br /><br />Might be why this show is always on at 2AM in replay.
1565 1 This is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town. One finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor, When tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.<br /><br />*SPOILER!!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER!!*<br /><br />The main character is taken by her young, handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop. In the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together.(in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted)
1566 0 I watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all. It might have been the first episode. Lately i realize <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down. I would say that I believe this show will be cancelled, but seeing as how <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing, they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them.
1567 1 The first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is "beauty". Beauty is all around, in actors' play (<ORGANIZATION>Andie</ORGANIZATION> is superb as always), in well designed shots, and in authors' red line idea - the Love.<br /><br />I think the <PERSON>Kenny</PERSON>'s character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life. His interaction makes <PERSON>Andie</PERSON>'s character living as entertaining as it could possibly be. When he's gone, it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires.<br /><br />The fact that <ORGANIZATION>Andie</ORGANIZATION> successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad, instead it shows that life prevails in any forms, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly.<br /><br />Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in all ways - all that houses and "fags" and accents :))). And <PERSON>Andie</PERSON> again is doing superb job! It is a shame that this movie got such low marks. 10 out of ten!
1568 0 Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins.<br /><br />In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like <PERSON>Beckham</PERSON> it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu.<br /><br />But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. <PERSON>Semra Turan</PERSON>, the "actress" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this clichÃ© movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.<br /><br />Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet. <br /><br />The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which are, by the way, not really convincing.<br /><br />Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story.
1569 1 Well, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was funny and sad and yes, the guy <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION> shagged was hot. Interesting, realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery. I think my Mum would like it. I still think they should have been allowed to call it the Sad F**kers Club though...
1570 0 This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of "Hamlet" to ever reach the screen. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON>'s approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting <PERSON>Ophelia</PERSON> in a straight jacket, having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail") when the palace is apparently guarded only by <PERSON>Francisco</PERSON> (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of "ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of <PERSON>Jimmy Cagney</PERSON>'s Bottom and <PERSON>Mary Pickford</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in <LOCATION>Elizabethan</LOCATION> mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of <PERSON>Hamlet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Olphelia</PERSON>'s relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.<br /><br />The uncut text does allow <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of <PERSON>Kenneth Branagh</PERSON>. This is never so apparent as in the "How All Occasions Inform Against Me" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's "I'll never be hungry again." This may serve <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON>'s ego, but it does not serve <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered "Great Moments With Mr. <PERSON>Hamlet</PERSON>." <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the <PERSON>Olivier</PERSON> film and its justly celebrated death of <PERSON>Claudius</PERSON> by having <PERSON>Hamlet</PERSON> jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Dane</PERSON> does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through <PERSON>Claudius</PERSON>' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.<br /><br />While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this <PERSON>Hamlet</PERSON> has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control.
1571 1 Me being of Irish origins, loved this movie, Not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl who he fell in love with too, she was pretty. They were such a cute couple. The ending was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you should watch prime. Same story line young guy falls for older women, older women falls for young guy to. A lot of paths cross, in the end, the best decision is made or task is completed. Don't have anything else to say, without ruining the whole movie, all though I thought the french guy was ugly, less appealing to me. Umm...if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends" ,that movie is so good. Quick quote, you might not get unless you watch it" well, thats my dinner ruined." LOL
1572 0 I saw this film on its release, and have watched it 3 or 4 more times, including last week. I regret I have to be a voice of dissension with regard to Mr. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON>'s performance.<br /><br />This is really a glorious, sumptuous film, to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designed. <PERSON>Derek Jacobi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Julie Christie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kate Winslet</PERSON>, <PERSON>Richard Briers</PERSON>, and many others do fine jobs. Then there's <PERSON>Kenneth Branagh</PERSON>. If ever there was a vanity project for an actor, this is it, and Mr. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> spares nothing in putting the "ham" in Hamlet. From the stunt casting (which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast <PERSON>Jack Lemmon</PERSON>), to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of "naturalness," to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others. His performance confirms that, while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary, he has never been a great film actor. The scenery budget could be charged to catering, Mr. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> eats so much of it. His performance is a perfect example of why people don't go to see <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> - "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." And if there is fault to his direction, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.<br /><br />No matter what theories people may posit on the Bard, he was, after all is said and done, a playwright. The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. Although there is no "right" way to play his plays, there is most certainly great acting, good acting and bad acting. <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> himself gives instructions to the players in the text of "Hamlet" itself. It amazes me how Mr. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> "mouthed" it, but did not hear it. It was an example of spending too much time working out how he's going to say something, and too little figuring out WHAT he's saying.<br /><br />While Mr. <PERSON>Branagh</PERSON> has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions, he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it. His direction has always been better than his acting. I still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>. He set a great template for other productions. And, it would be interesting to see him onstage, from about 20 rows back. But, I do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing? Certainly. There are many little joys to be found in the film. But, it's a long, long movie and, by the end, one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it.
1573 1 <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION>'s facial expressions are great again in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or all your life) you may feel you are wasting away. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). Her ex-student is cute enough, still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long. <br /><br />There are some parts that I thought rather unrealistic or unpractical, though. For example, at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION> dump the young man, would a mature police officer (the other friend of MacDowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? Is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car? Of course accidents happen all the time, but I hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with (that was the hardest part to believe!! For such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long??)... <br /><br />Maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long. Beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially to jealousy women over 40, who are waiting some miracles to happen. The sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continued to live, would that last? For how long? Nobody knows. Nonetheless, it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later.... a year later maybe.
1574 0 as an inspiring director myself, this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for <ORGANIZATION>DOF</ORGANIZATION>. The editing is good acting decent, sound effects aren't too over the top. I would have give it a 7 for an indie film, but the story aren't that interesting. It's more on the drama side, character developments than a horror flick.<br /><br />It's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.<br /><br />honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's<br /><br />This movie is about a family who has a dry field, and that is just that.
1575 1 I thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends. I laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time. It was just really touching. Although not a new concept this was a very well made film.
1576 0 A film with very little positive to say for it.<br /><br />Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.<br /><br />Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. I lost count of how many times I had seen "that" field at night or that bit of cracked earth.<br /><br />It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. We find <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON> is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. <PERSON>Beth</PERSON> has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.<br /><br />And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary Â– and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so.<br /><br />There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as <PERSON>Beth</PERSON> (the best performer in the piece, followed by <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> Â– the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on "medication".<br /><br />With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? He's six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene. Bad plinky plonk "horror" music fails to add atmosphere.<br /><br />Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
1577 1 Ok - I admit. I think <PERSON>Kenny Doughty</PERSON> looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.<br /><br />Starting out, we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie. One a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about. The third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's.<br /><br />They are almost the "First Wives Club", and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some "he left the credit card" behaviour. Characters set - the movie continues.<br /><br /><PERSON>McDowell</PERSON>'s character, the headmistress, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (<ORGANIZATION>Doughty</ORGANIZATION>) catches her eye. What will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief? Will they live happily ever after?<br /><br />A tissue or two recommended if you're the teary type - the end uplifting, but maybe not what you'd expect. All in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action, special effects and schlock horror.
1578 0 five minutes after watching this i logged on to IMDb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie... genre:horror? it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself "somethings gotta happen soon" it did not...when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer/director i've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works..<br /><br />i was taken in by the plot summary please don't make the same mistake.<br /><br />i gave this movie a 2 for the actors..they were not bad and it wasn't there fault they got such bad direction...
1579 1 Crush provides a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I find the English establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart. Mostly known for directing <PERSON>John McKay</PERSON> wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. All three professional women down-out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin, fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos. <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION> once again thrown by the surrounds of the British (which is where I find she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man. Small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends (great supporting cast) conflicts with her relationship. Unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness. Keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that. This is the type of film you either love or hate, which is why I believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released. As I'm sure most are just unearthing the film now. I very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as "Love Actually", and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments.
1580 0 Here is what happened:<br /><br />1) Head of BBC3 needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to BBC1 and BBC2 to keep licence and job.<br /><br />2) <PERSON>Lenny Henry</PERSON> offers his unfunny friends up.<br /><br />3) Head of BBC3 snaps them up, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny.<br /><br />Worst of all, it is arguably racist, as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes. If a white person did this kind of thing, there'd be uproar!<br /><br />Trash.
1581 1 <PERSON>Kenny Doughty</PERSON> as <PERSON>Jed Willis</PERSON> is sexier in this role than any male porn star, even though he keeps his pants on.<br /><br />The movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life. I don't think I can think of another movie, except perhaps <PERSON>Zeffirelli</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Romeo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Juliet</PERSON> that captures that giddy joy that well.<br /><br />The other draw of the movie is the very English eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously. In that sense it is much the same appeal as <ORGANIZATION>Midsomer Murder</ORGANIZATION> or a Miss Marple mystery, without the mayhem.<br /><br />This is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> an any relationships between people of different ages.
1582 0 Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says "lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask him if he is black, then walk away". The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is funny, and the show contains many such types of situation, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry. Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of the humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier. Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers, divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all.
1583 1 Having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on <ORGANIZATION>Rialto Channel</ORGANIZATION> I found it to be a pleasant, poignant and enriching film. <br /><br />The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places, (but this IS a film). The way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly, as real life can and does. Yes, I thought <PERSON>Andy MacDowell</PERSON> was great. I was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities (I find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion).<br /><br />I loved the bit at the end where <PERSON>Andy</PERSON>'s character said "sometimes I feel he was never here" etc., it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that (which I can personally identify with), then there was that gorgeous classical piece "Nocturne" I think by <PERSON>Chopin</PERSON>, which was a beautiful way to end (bar the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary).<br /><br />I say "well done" to the film makers - I have seen 1,000s of worse films!
1584 0 Thanks to the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. However after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my fortunes started to change. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented. When the series had finished I was running the sales department at work, banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local. If you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to <LOCATION>Poundland</LOCATION> and pick up the DVD it's only 99p.
1585 1 This is a refreshing, enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed, "Four Weddings and A Funeral", "<PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s Friends", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. Made me laugh, made me sad. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Enjoy!
1586 0 I wasn't sure how to rate this movie, since it was so bad it was actually very funny. I'm not a Gackt fan by any means, though he is talented, despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I always thought <PERSON>Hyde</PERSON> was talented though, Faith is an interesting album.<br /><br />But on topic here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films.<br /><br />The movie has almost no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them.<br /><br />The action scenes were laughable. Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that's so laughably bad. Though <PERSON>Hyde</PERSON> looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was horribly done. Though the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie.<br /><br />It keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, or an action flick, or a horror, or a romance... what the hell.<br /><br />If this review is making you mad, why? Is it because <PERSON>Gackt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hyde</PERSON> are your love? Don't fool yourself, this MOVIE IS BAD.
1587 1 I really truly enjoyed this movie. (Which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site!) I am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It is funny, poignant, and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others! (fess up ladies, we have ALL BEEN THERE!) <PERSON>Bill Paterson</PERSON> shines as the Reverand <PERSON>Gerald Marsden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andie McDowell</PERSON> proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it. (And truly, there is the best "wedding escape" that I have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone I have ever known!) You will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have done TONNES of box office. (now I have to look around to purchase a copy!)
1588 0 Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film, save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence.<br /><br />FORGET YOU EVER STUMBLED UPON THIS FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /><br />Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idol pretty-boys featuring nonsensical, convoluted "plot" that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you're ready to scream.<br /><br />Nothing in this film makes sense. It's an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FOR NO GOOD REASON. We can obviously see something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we just don't GIVE A CRAP WHY 'cause there's no backstory.<br /><br />By the time this film is over, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, lanky, girly stars' faces. You'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, be "serious," and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces.<br /><br />That some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the "soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /><br />Only the "converted," mindless minions will like this film, the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous. <PERSON>Freud</PERSON> would have a field day.<br /><br />Unless you're one of these mindless "fans," stay the hell away from this abomination.
1589 1 I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. <ORGANIZATION>Andie MacDowell</ORGANIZATION>'s performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a <ORGANIZATION>MacDowell</ORGANIZATION> film did not make her beauty another character in the film. The romance between <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. <PERSON>Imelda Stalinson</PERSON>, who has been a MVP in so many British films, does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in this but I think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting, clean direction, and witty writing.The film quality is excellent and the music is good, too, though unavailable on sound track.
1590 0 When you see <PERSON>Boris Karloff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bela Lugosi</PERSON> as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction. <PERSON>Karloff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lugosi</PERSON> both play scientists (Rukh and <PERSON>Benet</PERSON> respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins <PERSON>Benet</PERSON> over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." In that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br /><PERSON>Karloff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lugosi</PERSON> were both pretty good here. <PERSON>Lugosi</PERSON> pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. The story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10
1591 1 Too bad a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case. It is based on actual events, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, DE/Philadelphia PA region from '96 through 2000. I have to admit I was highly skeptical of how <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Inquirer</ORGANIZATION> news stories throughout the time period. Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case) who played <PERSON>Fahey</PERSON> looked nothing like her (<PERSON>Anne Marie</PERSON> was actually prettier). I have to admit though that <PERSON>Mark Harmon</PERSON> really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as <PERSON>Capano</PERSON>'s and the behavior that <PERSON>Capano</PERSON> exhibited throughout this period. Details of the case were right on...no deviations of dramatic effect...even down to the carpet, gun, furniture, and cooler. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I have met <PERSON>Tom Carper</PERSON> many times at various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime. Guys like <PERSON>Capano</PERSON> are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars.
1592 0 A somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the <ORGANIZATION>TBS</ORGANIZATION> cable station. <PERSON>Antonio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Janine</PERSON> run around chasing a killer computer virus and...that's about it. For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life '<PERSON>Melissa</PERSON>' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world.
1593 1 <PERSON>Thomas Capano</PERSON> was not <PERSON>Anne Marie</PERSON>'s boss <PERSON>Tom Carper</PERSON>, the Governor was. That is the reason the <ORGANIZATION>Feds</ORGANIZATION> became involved, he called <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and asked him to get the Feds involved in the case. I lived outside of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> at the time so the case was front page news every day. I also read <PERSON>Ann Rule</PERSON>'s book and saw the "City Confidential" segment on <ORGANIZATION>A&E</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Tom Capano</PERSON> was a megalomanic(sp.), an uber-controller and a monster. He claimed to love <PERSON>Ann Marie</PERSON> but all he wanted was someone that he could control. When she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her, the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he is still alive.
1594 0 I've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot. I could make a better movie with my cellphone camera. How do they manage to get actors to play in those movies?? Porn movies have better scenarios and effects... I wish I had those 2 hours back...<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is the cast. Even though, their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable, the rest was just WAY too bad! <br /><br />It's the type of movie that I'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight.<br /><br />Even worse, I saw a translated version of this flick...Imagine, a bad movie...with an even worst translation...Yikes!
1595 1 To those who have not followed the <PERSON>Anne Marie Fahey Murder</PERSON> case. You are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all. The murderer is popular <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON>Tom Capano</PERSON> and the victim is the <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> Governor's Scheduling Secretary, <PERSON>Anne Marie Fahey</PERSON>. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life? Besides, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series. While the actress who plays Ms. <PERSON>Fahey</PERSON> does a fine job, she does not have her dark long hair. His other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman. <PERSON>Mark Harmon</PERSON> is better looking and does an Emmy award winning performance as <PERSON>Tom Capano</PERSON>. It would be better with actual <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> locations. With <PERSON>Ann Rule</PERSON>'s executive producing, she adds accuracy to <PERSON>Anne Marie</PERSON>'s characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder. These bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it is well worth it. <PERSON>Ann Rule</PERSON> is a fascinating storyteller of true crime. It is ironic that <PERSON>Mark Harmon</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Tom Capano</PERSON>. He also played <PERSON>Ann Rule</PERSON>'s former friend and subject, <PERSON>Ted Bundy</PERSON> in an another book adaptation many years ago. He was brilliant then and now. He does an above average job with an amazing story. Even President <PERSON>CLinton</PERSON> offered his assistance in the <PERSON>Anne Marie Fahey</PERSON> case. And now, the former Governor <PERSON>Tom Carper</PERSON> is now the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> Senator for <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> who defeated longtime, popular incumbent Senator <PERSON>Richard Roth</PERSON> in the November 2000 election. IF you don't think the movie is interesting, then the read Rule's book.
1596 0 OK, the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale. This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier. Though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the writer didn't think of that.
1597 1 This excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really did cry in the end (which I don't want to give away!) It also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder. <br /><br />The cast was also very good. The only bad cast member was the actress who played <PERSON>Anne Marie</PERSON>. The actress did a great job, but the director didn't. I say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like <PERSON>Anne Marie Fahey</PERSON> herself.
1598 0 In some ways, the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close-up shots. I felt as though I had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people.<br /><br />The writer appears to have simply lifted clichÃ©s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. The actors did not help matters. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers didn't work very hard to develop the chemistry. Sure, they're both attractive, but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question.<br /><br />The confidence <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION>'s character shows in <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON>'s developed far too quickly and for no particular reason. <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON>'s character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. Think of the <PERSON>Jeff Goldblum</PERSON> character in "Independence Day." Usually, that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance. <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON>'s character does not. He's <PERSON>Cassandra</PERSON> with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball. He appears to be right by random chance.<br /><br />The death scenes are comical. Every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. The symptoms looked like bad claymation, sort of like that video from the 80s, <PERSON>Peter Gabriel</PERSON>, I think.
1599 1 he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case, portraying attorney (and murderer) <PERSON>Tom Capano</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Kathryn Morris</PERSON> is sympathetic as victim, <PERSON>Anne Marie Fahey</PERSON>, but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim. We are sorry for the situation, but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women (including <PERSON>Rachel Ward</PERSON>) as well.<br /><br />The sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues, and <PERSON>Capano</PERSON> actually had her psychologist killed. Pretty hard to believe, but this was based on a true story.<br /><br />There is a cameo with <PERSON>Olympia Dukakis</PERSON> (excellent) as <PERSON>Capano</PERSON>'s mother. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true murder, and you will want to read <PERSON>Ann Rule</PERSON>'s book to get the accurate details. 8/10.
1600 0 Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so silly the desired "fright factor" just isn't realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it. <br /><br />One presumes <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON> has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON> gave for some of his later, trashy venues. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two should be construed,however.
1601 1 I couldn't have been more thrilled; Just eight years old back in 1983, I was going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. To that time, my only Star Wars experience had been a few <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> showings of Star Wars. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet.<br /><br />And boy, did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. A green-bladed lightsaber!! Wow! Since that magical day, I must have watched this movie hundreds of times. I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple viewings, I have of course observed that this movie - the REAL Episode III - does have its flaws.<br /><br />Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "quirks".<br /><br />Millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983, I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie.
1602 0 Despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichÃ©d).<br /><br />The cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn't help thinking, though, that <PERSON>Janine Turner</PERSON> is a bit of a <PERSON>Geena Davis</PERSON> look-a-like. Maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.<br /><br />While it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard, 'Fatal Error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.
1603 1 I suppose <ORGANIZATION>JEDI</ORGANIZATION> is now chronologically to be considered the very "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these. I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> as a character(and also <PERSON>Mark Hamill</PERSON>, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and, err -- <PERSON>Carrie Fisher</PERSON> looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.
1604 0 Like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine... The director clearly is a fan of <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.<br /><br />I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes. Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
1605 1 I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (<PERSON>Lando</PERSON>'s co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and <ORGANIZATION>Yoda</ORGANIZATION> and then it shows up <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sebastian Shaw</PERSON>)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.<br /><br />I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>Death Star</ORGANIZATION>. Post-script: The scenes with <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.
1606 0 I have read the novel Reaper of <PERSON>Ben Mezrich</PERSON> a fews years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaption.<br /><br />Although it's been years since I read the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous. Very important elements, which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad.<br /><br />If the plot sounds interesting to you: go and get the novel. Its much, much, much better.<br /><br />Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by <PERSON>Ben Mezrich</PERSON>.
1607 1 As Most Off You Might off Seen Star Wars: Return Off The Jedi You May Knows Its A Good Movie But As You Might Have Seen On Video They M|might have a party At The end And They Just Probably End The Movie with the party with no a spirits or anything But on the original one (Live TV) When they are Partying But before i say more when <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship Or Death Star They Saw him Disappear And Yoda Dies From Either Old Age Or Internal Illness But because <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> killed <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> (Real Name: <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON>) When They All Are Partying At The end when Luke Or Someone Stops the Spirits Off <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> And Yoda Stands Starring At Him And Smiling While Another Spirit Appears Is its Darth Vader but not as A Sith As The Old Usual Selve off Him And Started Smiling with <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> And Yoda I reckon That made the movie ending a little bit interesting But the Producers or anyone should off made a spirit off Padme And Mace Windu And Other Jedis that got killed with Younglings Under There Arms in the back ground
1608 0 I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.<br /><br />A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /><br />This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage, which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.<br /><br />Oh dear...
1609 1 No, there is another !<br /><br />Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I, II & III and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, I will state the good points of "The Return of the Jedi" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere.<br /><br />What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating insights about the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - <PERSON>Harrison Ford</PERSON>'s smile - A killer scene : Near the ending, when Vader looks alternatively at his son and at the Emperor. The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>, thereby risking his own life ! Oh, boy !<br /><br />What is wrong in the prequel INMHO : - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The <ORGANIZATION>Force</ORGANIZATION> seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /><br />By the way, if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (<PERSON>Obi Wen</PERSON>, I mean) and <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON>, then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in <LOCATION>Ancient Japan</LOCATION>.<br /><br />The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. "De mon Ã¢me Ã  ton Ã¢me", (from my soul to yours), as would write <PERSON>Bejard</PERSON> to the late Zen master <PERSON>T. Deshimaru</PERSON>.
1610 0 <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON> is the evil boss of <LOCATION>Digicron</LOCATION>, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.<br /><br />'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system' <br /><br />'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time'<br /><br />'but it's not going after software, it's killing people'<br /><br />watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
1611 1 "Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> finally comes face to face with <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>, the most recognizable villain in movie history.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the "Empire Strikes Back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at <ORGANIZATION>Jabba's Palace</ORGANIZATION>, a masterful performance of <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON> as the Emperor, <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>'s romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the <ORGANIZATION>Endor</ORGANIZATION> moon.<br /><br />Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!
1612 0 This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. <br /><br />Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time. Just plain torture.<br /><br />I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. Horrible. Horrible.

Well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport.<br /><br />My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK'd this drivel, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: "Sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! Our audience are idiots!"<br /><br />I was hooked just to know how it could get any worse. This is not a good sign, folks. <br /><br />Hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.<br /><br />I should be ashamed for watching it.<br /><br />I am ashamed. I'm off for a long shower.

1614 0 I didn't expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring <PERSON>Antonio Sabato Jr</PERSON>. Still, it managed to disappoint, failing even to be a good-bad film.<br /><br />Every scene was by rote, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, leaned back and said, "My work is done". It's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Watch "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let anyone know that sitting through "Fatal Error" is just that.
1615 1 Dear Readers,<br /><br />The final battle between the Rebellion and Empire. The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Alliance</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON>, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>, now revealed as <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of <LOCATION>Endor</LOCATION> while <PERSON>Lando Calrissian</PERSON> leads the attack on the <ORGANIZATION>Death Star</ORGANIZATION>. Little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the Emperor <PERSON>Palpatine</PERSON> himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mark Hamill</PERSON> is fully matured now into a <PERSON>Jedi Knight</PERSON>, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> is still cool in this film as well as Han and <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>. 3P0, R2, and Chewie do their roles to a T while <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> still is cinema's greatest villain: <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>. <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON> is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless Emperor <PERSON>Palpatine</PERSON>. The Action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON>'s score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.<br /><br />Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
1616 0 Extremely disappointing film based on the <PERSON>James Michener</PERSON> novel.<br /><br />What was even worse was <PERSON>Marlon Brando</PERSON>'s performance. His southern drawl was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. <PERSON>Brando</PERSON>, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. <PERSON>Tyrone Power</PERSON>, in "Witness for the Prosecution," should have been nominated for best actor instead of <PERSON>Brando</PERSON> here.<br /><br />The film, dealing with racism, dealt with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government's attempt to avoid marriages between <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers and Japanese women.<br /><br /><PERSON>Brando</PERSON> was stone-faced throughout the movie. His moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.<br /><br />Only the lord knows why <ORGANIZATION>Red Buttons</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Miyoshi Umeki</PERSON> received supporting Oscars for their performances. Nothing about either performance was equally impressive. <PERSON>Umeki</PERSON>'s appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. A better performance in this film was done by <PERSON>Miiko Taka</PERSON>, who did nicely as <PERSON>Brando</PERSON>'s love interest. She showed great emotion as the anti-American who found love with the <PERSON>Brando</PERSON> character. Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in World War 11. She realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.<br /><br /><PERSON>Martha Scott</PERSON> went from the Hebrew mother <PERSON>Yochobel</PERSON> in "The Ten Commandments" to the bigoted mother of <PERSON>Brando</PERSON>'s love interest at first. Her performance together with the one of <PERSON>Ricardo Montalban</PERSON> was wasted. <PERSON>Patricia Owens</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Brando</PERSON>'s first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
1617 1 I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> no longer fights with Solo, <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> looks boring, <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> is not as evil as before, and <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> just dies.<br /><br />But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of <PERSON>Anakin</PERSON> to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.<br /><br />Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
1618 0 I was expecting a little something from "K-911", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be <PERSON>Jame</PERSON>'s movie, not <PERSON>Jerry Lee</PERSON>'s. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that <PERSON>James</PERSON> seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, <PERSON>James</PERSON> will realize it was his brother <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish <PERSON>Ashlee Simpson</PERSON> would take that same advice? :D <br /><br />3/10
1619 1 A very good movie. A classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of aliens. We see the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Alliance</ORGANIZATION> leaders and much of the Imperial forces. The Emperor is somewhat an original character. I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON> spirit along with <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader turns on the Emperor. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> and...his father (1997 version not <PERSON>Hayden Christenssen</PERSON>). The next best scene is when <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> rushes to strike back <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> to protect <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>. There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. I felt there was much more than meets the eye. And as always the <PERSON>John William</PERSON>'s music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe.
1620 0 If you are one of the people who finds "According to <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. And might I add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, which prefers to air crap like <PERSON>Jim Belushi</PERSON>'s show year after year.<br /><br />"K-911" is a big, steaming, brown, German shepherd-sized "thank you" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser <PERSON>Belushi</PERSON> deserve. <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>'s comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard. Look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.<br /><br />If you enjoy <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>'s work, this movie is your reward.
1621 1 This is probably the best of all of the Star Wars movies. <br /><br />The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster Jabba the Hutt was getting even more serious. He ordered <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of <PERSON>Bantha</PERSON>, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Jedi</PERSON> powers eventually finish the monster off. Adding to the sneaky rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of Episode V, <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON> was very angry about this that <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> was sentenced to die at the Sarlacc pit outside.<br /><br />But all of the Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas...and those other ideas fended off <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s execution; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> was able to use the force to fatally choke Jabba to death.<br /><br />Like in Episode IV, the <ORGANIZATION>Death Star in Episode VI</ORGANIZATION> makes its appearance. As I analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the Imperial fighters around the Death Star, the Star Destroyer personnel, I guessed, sped up the arming of the main laser, using the Imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 Star Destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the <PERSON>Death Star</PERSON> was fired in surprise. Once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the Death Star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected <PERSON>Lando</PERSON> so much because he wanted to destroy the <PERSON>Death Star</PERSON> but he couldn't until the shield was taken out. And it was taken out with <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>'s increasing impatience.<br /><br />Like in Episode V, the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Walkers</ORGANIZATION> make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the Ewoks...but the Ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. For instance, Chewbacca, as well as another Ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.<br /><br />It is amazing what <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> could do with his Jedi powers on his Light Sabre, like, for instance, the scene on <ORGANIZATION>Endor</ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> deflects incoming laser shots from a Storm Trooper speeder bike, and using the <ORGANIZATION>Sabre</ORGANIZATION> to knock out part of the bike. Or, in a climax, using the <ORGANIZATION>Sabre</ORGANIZATION> to break off his own father's arm during the final <ORGANIZATION>Sabre</ORGANIZATION> fight with Sith Vader.<br /><br />You probably know the Ewoks celebration after the Death Star was blown, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (e.g., Storm Trooper Masks), and <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> finally meeting up with <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> after <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s own nemesis---<PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>, now dead, is burned on a pyre. The celebration include Ewoks singing but I think <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON>.<br /><br />On the home movie version, I think <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration on <ORGANIZATION>Endor</ORGANIZATION>, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the Death Star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.
1622 0 The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and have watched it several times. And though I know that sequels are not usually as good as the original I certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb. The romance was flat, the sight gags old, the spoken humor just wasn't. This may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen but it comes close.
1623 1 When I think of Return of the Jedi I think epic. Yeah Ewoks were in there so what? They're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). <PERSON>Jedi</PERSON> is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. Emperor <PERSON>Palpatine</PERSON> (portrayed by the amazing theater actor <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON>) was one the best parts of the movie. <PERSON>Palpatine</PERSON> is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> compared to him . Speaking of <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern day Greek tragedy and I think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you. The best part was of course the special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. The scenes at Jabba's palace (<PERSON>Leia</PERSON> looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. In all Jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between <PERSON>Luke Vader</PERSON> and <PERSON>Palpatine</PERSON> and when <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> reveals the truth to <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.
1624 0 I am very disappointed with "K-911." The original "good" quality of "K-9" doesn't exist any more. This is more like a sitcom! Some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back. The captain of <PERSON>Dooley</PERSON> now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show. That was crazy. What's the deal with the change of Police? It seems like they are now LAPD! Not <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> PD. It is a completely different movie from "
1625 1 I was but a babe in arms when <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> and the notorious <PERSON>Darth Vadar</PERSON> but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. In A New Hope <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>, the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister <PERSON>Darth Vadar</PERSON>. In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. Vadar it seemed had won the day. How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? In <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from <PERSON>Han</PERSON>'s daring rescue from <LOCATION>Jabba</LOCATION>'s palace to the the final climactic battle on the Death Star between <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and Vadar as <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> struggles between fulfilling his duties as a Jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his Father's soul.<br /><br />Old friends like the smooth talking <PERSON>Lando Calrissian</PERSON> and the ever lovable Chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the Emperor himself ( played by the brilliant <PERSON>Ian McDiarmiud.How</PERSON> he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice <PERSON>Darth Vadar.All</PERSON> in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed Master of the events that unfold. His new and improved <PERSON>Death Star</PERSON> spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the Empire's reign for good. <br /><br /><PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. We watch in excitement as Han and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> attempt to bring down the shield around the Death Star from the forest Moon of Endor with the help of some adorable Ewoks ( who I really do not believe take from the movie at all. In fact I feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the <ORGANIZATION>Death Star</ORGANIZATION>) and hindered by legions of Stormtroopers and <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Officers</ORGANIZATION>. We cheer on <PERSON>Lando</PERSON> and the other pilots as they take on the mighty <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Fleet</ORGANIZATION> and risk life and limb to fly into the <ORGANIZATION>Deatn Star</ORGANIZATION> to destroy it once and for all. And we watch with bated breath as Vadar and the Emperor attempt to turn <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back.<br /><br />But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside <LOCATION>Darth Vadar</LOCATION>. For ROTJ is a battle of emotions and feelings. Vadar is caught between his loyalty to the Emporer and the Empire and his Fatherly inclinations to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>. Never did I think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on Vadar's face during the final scenes as the Emporer turns on <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>. There is more depth and emotion to Vadar than I believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible. He is conflicted. The Apprentice as much as the Master. The Victim as much as the Villain. Without ruining the end too much Vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.<br /><br />So in conclusion what can I say. <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> is the master of the Saga. Star Wars is the most compelling and engaging Sagas I've seen in a long time and I have yet to see another Saga rival it. Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> masterpiece deserves. It's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> can be proud of.
1626 0 The Biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say <PERSON>Zues</PERSON> takes DUTCH commands. But she is speaking German to him. The 2 languishes are completely different, its like saying "well he takes French commands" and start talking Spanish.<br /><br /><PERSON>James Belushi</PERSON> gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest. The role just doesn't fit him, even if its mend to be a comedy.<br /><br />To many stereotype/predicable stuff. Typical comment or comebacks.<br /><br />If you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on TV. But i wouldn't suggesting renting it.
1627 1 After ''Empire strikes back'' ''Return of the Jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series.<br /><br /><PERSON>Luke</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>Tattoine</LOCATION> to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Alliance</ORGANIZATION>. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.<br /><br />R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Jabba</LOCATION>,where <PERSON>Lukes</PERSON> pretends to negotiate <PERSON>Han</PERSON>'s life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON> as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite) <PERSON>Lando</PERSON> is hidden as <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON>'s guard and <LOCATION>Chewbacca</LOCATION> is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> in a disguise. The problem is that <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON> discovers <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>'s plan and takes her as his slave,while <PERSON>Han</PERSON> is thrown away in <LOCATION>Chewbacca</LOCATION>'s cell.<br /><br /><PERSON>Luke</PERSON> comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON>'s monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it. Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han,Chewbacca and <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>Sarlacc</ORGANIZATION>, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even <PERSON>Boba Fett</PERSON> dies when <PERSON>Han</PERSON> accidentally throws him in to <PERSON>Sarlacc</PERSON>'s mouth. <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> kills Jabba and goes after <PERSON>Han</PERSON>,<PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and Chewie as well c3po and R2. <br /><br />Everybody's safe again,<PERSON>Luke</PERSON> decides to go to <LOCATION>Dagoba</LOCATION> to complete his training as a Jedi,as well his promise to <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON>. The problem is that <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> says to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> that he does not need more training,but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> that Vader is <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s dad, and that there is another <PERSON>Skywalker</PERSON> besides <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>. In his last moments, <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> asks to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> dies,<PERSON>Obi</PERSON> wan's spirit shows up to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and tells him that <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s father killed his good side <PERSON>Anakin</PERSON> to become <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. <PERSON>Obi Wan</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> that his twin sister is <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>, and says the reasons why <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> were separated since babies. He gives his last advice to <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.<br /><br />At the same time, the Emperor says to Vader that he must give <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to him when he shows up, since <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to the dark side.<br /><br />Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Alliance</ORGANIZATION> plans to attack the new space station, the '' Death Star 2'', <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> will confront Vader and the Emperor, and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>, Han and chewie needs to turn off the 'Death star 2' power field, with the help of the EWOKS. (little creatures who looks little bears)<br /><br />This is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!
1628 0 This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cop movie clichÃ© is present and accounted for. Bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess they're saving those old chestnuts for <PERSON>Dooley</PERSON>'s next outing. Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like <PERSON>Dooley</PERSON>'s prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.
1629 1 Thanks to <PERSON>Kevin Smith</PERSON>, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Return of the Jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone liked <PERSON>Return of the Jedi</PERSON> until someone in a <PERSON>Kevin Smith</PERSON> movie made a negative comment about it. Now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it. This movie is so much better than anything <PERSON>Kevin Smith</PERSON> ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it. This movie is good fun! It's just as awesome as I remember it being when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing <PERSON>Kevin Smith</PERSON>'s opinions! His aren't correct!<br /><br />And that <PERSON>Ewok</PERSON> song at the end ruled! I bet you people don't even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor"!!!! I'm going to set you all on fire!
1630 0 I just got the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5. The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and here are my findings.<br /><br />Some initial disappointment - I hadn't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the <PERSON>Kirk Alyn</PERSON> serials. I'm not a huge fan of <PERSON>George Reeves</PERSON> as <PERSON>Superman</PERSON>, and I hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of <PERSON>Kirk Alyn</PERSON> - but hey ho, never mind.<br /><br />This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON>' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget.<br /><br />The story concerns the small town of <LOCATION>Silsby</LOCATION> - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of <LOCATION>Metropolis</LOCATION> reporters <PERSON>Kent</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.<br /><br />A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so <PERSON>Jeff Corey</PERSON> (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these "creatures". <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. <PERSON>Corey</PERSON>'s pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. <PERSON>Corey</PERSON> incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised <PERSON>Mole-Man</PERSON>. <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. A total of 4 <ORGANIZATION>Mole-Men</ORGANIZATION> emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at <PERSON>Jeff Corey</PERSON> (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make <PERSON>Corey</PERSON> go "Aargh!") and <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The end.<br /><br />Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the "Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.<br /><br /><PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> is quite a good <PERSON>Clark Kent</PERSON> - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than <PERSON>Phyllis Coates</PERSON>' rather indifferent <PERSON>Lois Lane</PERSON>. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to "strike the pose" (which <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.<br /><br />And <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.<br /><br />I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.<br /><br />Something of a disappointment - I shan't be watching it again.
1631 1 This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. It's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.<br /><br />One problem here is the look of the film, which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer <PERSON>Gary Kurtz</PERSON>. The first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. In "Jedi" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.<br /><br />Another aspect is its lack of originality. Where "Star Wars" created a whole new experience in cinema and "Empire" brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, "Jedi" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> or <PERSON>Kasdan</PERSON> could). Also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of "Star Wars" if they hadn't run out of cash. It just feels like lazy construction.<br /><br />The most unfortunate aspect of "Jedi" for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character. Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> loves <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> -- as if the conclusion of "Empire" where she confessed her love of him had never happened. The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This is more like a 1990s <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> performance, bored and looking "above" the film itself. <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> for her part is visibly high in some scenes. <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>, an interesting character introduced in "Empire", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. Only <PERSON>Hamill</PERSON>, given an interesting development in the Luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON> does excellent work as well as the Emperor. The film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).<br /><br />Visually and in terms of effects work, other than the "clean" look of everything it's hard to find fault. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.<br /><br />Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' later productions.
1632 0 Back in the 1970s, <ORGANIZATION>WPIX</ORGANIZATION> ran "The Adventures of Superman" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years. Every once in a while, we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air "Superman and the Mole Men." I always looked forward to those days. Watching it recently, I was surprised at just how bad it really was.<br /><br />It wasn't bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. True, <PERSON>George Reeves</PERSON>' Superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible. And true, the Mole Men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year-old, since the zippers, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. But these were forgivable shortcomings.<br /><br />No, what made it bad were the contrived plot devices. Time and again, <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating. A lynch mob is searching for the creatures? Rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to <PERSON>Lois</PERSON> and the PR man. The creatures are cornered? Again, he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot. <PERSON>Luke Benson</PERSON>, the town's rabble-rouser, shoots at him? Attempted murder to any reasonable person, but <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> releases the man over and over to cause more problems. <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud, but never once took advantage of them.<br /><br />That said, both <PERSON>George Reeves</PERSON> and <PERSON>Phyllis Coates</PERSON> played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles. If only they had been given a better script to work with.
1633 1 first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> has found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.<br /><br />How, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about <PERSON>Anakin</PERSON>, not just <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>'s lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.<br /><br />Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.
1634 0 "You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive." Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fiÂ… Yet despite the odd gem like that, <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> and the Mole-Men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. It's beyond cheap (the one shot of Superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message Â– the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr <PERSON>Mxyzptlk</PERSON> without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and <PERSON>George Reeves</PERSON>' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by <PERSON>Jeff Corey</PERSON> from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
1635 1 I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like <ORGANIZATION>ROTJ</ORGANIZATION> was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.<br /><br />It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> died b) Because <PERSON>Bobba Fett</PERSON> died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> was revealed<br /><br />I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if <PERSON>Bobba Fett</PERSON> died??? If <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of <PERSON>Bobba Fett</PERSON> but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out <ORGANIZATION>Bobba Fett</ORGANIZATION>'s name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON>'s death.. Well, nobody complained when <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was <PERSON>Obi Wan</PERSON>'s death okay but <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON>'s not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add, it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, <LOCATION>Chewbacca</LOCATION>, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at <LOCATION>Cloud City</LOCATION> when our heroes were escaping <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>'s base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> and being shot at (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> were trying to exit the <ORGANIZATION>Death Star</ORGANIZATION>.<br /><br />The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> was trying to find whether or not <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> was his father, <PERSON>Annakin Skywalker</PERSON>. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By <PERSON>Annakin</PERSON>'s revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was <PERSON>Annakin Skywalker</PERSON> (by removing the helmet). The point is that <PERSON>Annakin</PERSON> died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?<br /><br />On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that "Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see." That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.<br /><br />I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and his father in <ORGANIZATION>ROTJ</ORGANIZATION> was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!<br /><br />Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as "just another sequel") to trash the movie such as "This movie stinks because <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> is not in it!" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like <ORGANIZATION>ROTJ</ORGANIZATION> suffered unfortunately.<br /><br />
1636 0 This film is notable for three reasons.<br /><br />First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking <PERSON>George Reeves</PERSON>' and <PERSON>Phyllis Coates</PERSON>' initial appearances as <PERSON>Clark Kent</PERSON> / <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lois Lane</PERSON>. Part of the opening is re-used in the series. Outside the town of <LOCATION>Silby</LOCATION>, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth' allowing the 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot).<br /><br />Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. No 'mild mannered reporter' here! <PERSON>Clark Kent</PERSON>, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout ("I'll handle this!"), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole-Man! As <PERSON>Superman</PERSON>, he is gentler than <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> towards the feisty <PERSON>Lois</PERSON>, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as "Nazi storm troopers." <br /><br />Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'Adventures of <PERSON>Superman</PERSON>' had not yet been made.
1637 1 Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.<br /><br />The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s Jedi powers, they have the edge.<br /><br />We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> and Chewy battle it out on <ORGANIZATION>Endor</ORGANIZATION>, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Fleet</ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>, battle with the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Fleet</ORGANIZATION> while they wait for the shields to go down, and <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> has a final showdown with <ORGANIZATION>Darth Vader</ORGANIZATION>. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two.<br /><br />10/10
1638 0 "The Domino Principle" is, without question, one of the worst thrillers ever made. Hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream "I give up!!!"<br /><br />How <PERSON>Gene Hackman</PERSON> and director <PERSON>Stanley Kramer</PERSON> ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks.<br /><br />I hope they spent their money well.
1639 1 Despite the feelings of most "Star Wars" fans, in my opinion "Return Of The Jedi" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. Ever since the first time I saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> gives us a rousing finish of the "Star Wars" saga in "Jedi".<br /><br />Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)<br /><br />After "The Empire Strikes Back" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in "Return Of The Jedi". Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction. The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Alliance</ORGANIZATION> and bring young <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> to the Dark Side. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>, Chewie, and the droids all travel to <LOCATION>Tatooine</LOCATION> to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON> defeated, <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> returns to <LOCATION>Dagobah</LOCATION> to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> is in fact his father. The rebel heroes regroup with the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Fleet</ORGANIZATION>. Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While <PERSON>Lando</PERSON> heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Moon Of Endor</ORGANIZATION>. It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks. During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In emotionally charged sequences <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. As young <PERSON>Skywalker</PERSON> is about to face his death at the hands of <LOCATION>Palpatine</LOCATION>, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life. <br /><br />Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, "Return Of The Jedi" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us.

1641 1 This final entry in <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON>'s STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.<br /><br />The first third of the movie, where <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.<br /><br />Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> discovers that he and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by <PERSON>Warrick Davis</PERSON>) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Troops</ORGANIZATION>' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.<br /><br />By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, <PERSON>Lando</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Forces</ORGANIZATION> launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s final showdown with <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> and the Emperor. The latter ties with the <ORGANIZATION>Jabba Palace</ORGANIZATION> sequence as the highlight of the movie. <PERSON>Mark Hamill</PERSON> flexes his acting chops once again as <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured <PERSON>Jedi Knight</PERSON> makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>' voice as <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON>. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.<br /><br />The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; <PERSON>Hamill</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harrison Ford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carrie Fisher</PERSON> all mature and deepen into their roles, and <PERSON>Anthony Daniels</PERSON> provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. <PERSON>Frank Oz</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON>' music.<br /><br />All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.<br /><br />In 1997, <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) "Special Editions", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) "Jedi Rocks" musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on <LOCATION>Naboo</LOCATION>, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, "Wesa free!"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, <PERSON>Hayden Christensen</PERSON> as the specter of <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON> in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.<br /><br />As nice as it would be to have <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the "definitive" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.
1642 0 <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Kramer</ORGANIZATION> directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features <PERSON>Gene Hackman</PERSON> as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. <PERSON>Richard Widmark</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edward Albert</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Eli Wallach</PERSON> are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> asks a lot of questions that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>'s direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. <PERSON>Widmark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wallach</PERSON> are suitably nasty and <PERSON>Albert</PERSON> is well cast as <PERSON>Widmark</PERSON>'s cruel lackey. Even the usually obnoxious <PERSON>Mickey Rooney</PERSON> is pretty good as <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON>'s sidekick. One oddity however is the casting of <PERSON>Candice Bergen</PERSON> as <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON>'s wife. We're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>'s idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. It's a role better suited for the likes of <PERSON>Valerie Perrine</PERSON> or <PERSON>Susan Tyrell</PERSON>.
1643 1 After "Star Wars: A New Hope" redefined science fiction, and "The Empire Strikes Back" redefined "Star Wars", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>), the battle raging on in space (including <PERSON>Lando</PERSON>), and a confrontation between <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of "The Empire Strikes Back", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of "A New Hope" and the more sinnister tone of "The Empire Strikes Back", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for "Return of the Jedi" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening <PERSON>Sarlaac</PERSON>'s mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.
1644 0 There are really two sections of this film. Firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'The Simpsons' <PERSON>Troy McClure</PERSON> should be doing the narration.<br /><br />Then the rest of the film begins (starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film) which, while technically OK, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense.<br /><br />This is especially so with <PERSON>Mickey Rooney</PERSON>'s Spiventa, who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? In that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is.<br /><br />The overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy. It's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.<br /><br />Put simply, the film fails on all levels.
1645 1 The last film in <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a notch above episode IV (and just a notch below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. It is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' universe. There is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s (and Vader's) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. I'm glad <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> eventually dropped the idea of making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinÃ©e style.
1646 0 First, it takes a full half hour to get <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> out of jail and to start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. Then <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. By the time the real action gets going, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.
1647 1 Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.<br /><br />None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Darth Vader</LOCATION>.<br /><br />Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between <PERSON>Carrie Fisher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harrison Ford</PERSON>. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.<br /><br />In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.
1648 0 <PERSON>Gene Hackman</PERSON> gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination. It's a given of course that <PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> has the proficient skills for the job.<br /><br />Nobody tells him anything though, he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information. That's supposed to be suspenseful, instead it's annoying and boring. <br /><br /><PERSON>Hackman</PERSON> goes through with the mission, but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up. So everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit. Maybe something really was lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience.<br /><br />A very talented cast that had people like <PERSON>Richard Widmark</PERSON>, <PERSON>Candice Bergen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mickey Rooney</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eli Wallach</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Edward Albert</PERSON> is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime. <br /><br />And we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this, the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION> or even the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>.
1649 1 When it comes to creating a universe <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON> went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Vader</LOCATION> more bitter considering the love he felt for PadmÃ© and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.<br /><br /><PERSON>Mark Hamill</PERSON> does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. <PERSON>Harrison Ford</PERSON> is still good. However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired from Raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. <PERSON>Carrie Fisher</PERSON> was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON> appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON> still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very, very good.<br /><br />In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' fortÃ© so that is really to be expected. The final battle over <ORGANIZATION>Endor</ORGANIZATION> is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. <br /><br />The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.<br /><br />All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that <PERSON>Richard Marquand</PERSON> is a less accomplished director than <ORGANIZATION>Irvin Kershner</ORGANIZATION> does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON>' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.<br /><br />8/10
1650 0 I can't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie. That's all I've got to say - the movie speaks for itself!!
1651 1 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original "Star Wars" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first "Star Wars" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON>, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a <ORGANIZATION>Northern Illinois University</ORGANIZATION> thing).<br /><br />I can't review "Star Wars" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on <PERSON>Hoth</PERSON> (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to "Star Wars" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Trek" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON>'s films.<br /><br />I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of <PERSON>Anakin Skywalker</PERSON>.<br /><br />Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+
1652 0 I love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick.<br /><br />I can only wonder, what WERE they thinking agreeing to this crap???<br /><br />Debra Winger just phoned it in; <PERSON>Dennis Quaid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arliss Howard</PERSON> were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably like this too. I hated both. 3/10
1653 1 I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks! True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable. Yubb Nubb!<br /><br />This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> to <PERSON>Anakin</PERSON>. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.<br /><br />I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. <PERSON>Hamill</PERSON> does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). <PERSON>Harrison Ford</PERSON> - need I say more?<br /><br />The music is once again brilliant. It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> shouts "NOOO!" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON> is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!<br /><br />Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.<br /><br />Bravo!
1654 0 Blazing saddles! It's a fight between two estranged brothers (<PERSON>Dennis Quaid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arliss Howard</PERSON>), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director <PERSON>Glenn Gordon Caron</PERSON> (the TV whiz-kid behind "Moonlighting") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in <PERSON>Vince Gilligan</PERSON>'s screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. These aren't even characters, they're plot functions. Barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good. Winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed. *1/2 from ****
1655 1 Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: "Return of the Jedi". Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect "The Empire Strikes Back". Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? Only he can answer that question.<br /><br />This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga. Following on from the conclusion of "The Empire Strikes Back", <PERSON>Luke Skywalker</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mark Hamill</PERSON>) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to <LOCATION>Tatooine</LOCATION>, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (<ORGANIZATION>Harrison Ford</ORGANIZATION>), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by <PERSON>Jabba the Hutt</PERSON> for overdue debts.<br /><br /><PERSON>Skywalker</PERSON> is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (<PERSON>Alec Guiness</PERSON>) to fight the evil Empire. Now swathed all in black, <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.<br /><br />Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from <PERSON>Jabba</PERSON>'s lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty <PERSON>Sarlac</PERSON>' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the <LOCATION>Sarlac</LOCATION>, making it look fake and overdone.<br /><br />The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.<br /><br />When <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> one more time, the viewer is let down by <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON>'s distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of "The Empire Strikes Back", <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> is all but erased from the story as the progression of <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s destiny is played out on screen.<br /><br />ROTJ really is <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>'s film, perhaps even more so than the original. His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON> and his fate. The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The romance between <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> (<PERSON>Carrie Fisher</PERSON>) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in "Empire". In fact only <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>'s character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.<br /><br />Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion. This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful <PERSON>Skywalker</PERSON> to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) <PERSON>Darth Vader</PERSON>. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor <PERSON>Tarkin</PERSON> (<PERSON>Peter Cushing</PERSON>) from "Star Wars", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Played brilliantly by <PERSON>Ian McDiarmid</PERSON>, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.<br /><br />All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. <PERSON>Hamill</PERSON> surprises as the more wisened <PERSON>Luke</PERSON>, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all. <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Leia</PERSON> is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... Add in favourites like <PERSON>Alec Guiness</PERSON> as <PERSON>Kenobi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Yoda</PERSON> and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.<br /><br />Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on <ORGANIZATION>Endor</ORGANIZATION>, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for "2001: A Space Odyssey", <PERSON>John Williams</PERSON>' score is as much a part of "Star Wars" folklore as light sabers and the Force.<br /><br /><PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again. <ORGANIZATION>ROTJ</ORGANIZATION> works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.<br /><br />When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. Is it already? The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series. This is why "Return of the Jedi" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.
1656 0 Let's see. In the "St. Elsewhere" finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child. "<PERSON>Newhart</PERSON>" ended by telling us that it had all been a dream. And "Roseanne" ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind. Very "creative". Annoying was more like it. Yes, it was just a TV show and wasn't at all reality. It's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or TV show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all "real". At least as far as the reality it portrays on screen. This type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. Now "<PERSON>Newhart</PERSON>" being all a dream? At least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. The idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the Best Series Finale Ever. <PERSON>Roseanne</PERSON> left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.
1657 1 I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.<br /><br />This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br /><br />-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.<br /><br />-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.<br /><br />-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br /><br />-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and <PERSON>Leia</PERSON>) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (<PERSON>Lando</PERSON>'s Moment)<br /><br />-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.<br /><br />All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.
1658 0 I heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good. But I started watching the film (on my film-channel)and was interested. This could be a really great, darkly black satire on todays morals in media. The small featurettes on every contestent were good. It build up to something I wouldn't wanna miss. But when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. Here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb.<br /><br />The ending is so bad I give it a 1. Even if the film starts of promising.
1659 1 I will admit, I thought this movie wasn't going to be any good but I soon changed my mind. The movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going. <PERSON>Pierce Broson</PERSON> is amazing in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help. <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> is an awesome straight man, as his role as a mild mannered man from <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, who starts a innocent conversation with <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> at a Mexican bar. The movie will have you laughing as <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex).<br /><br />The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.
1660 0 I really don't understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic.<br /><br /><PERSON>Eva Mendez</PERSON> is hot but terrible in this film. But I don't think it is her own fault but the directors. He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.<br /><br />The star I'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.<br /><br />Don't watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> or some <PERSON>David Lynch</PERSON>.
1661 1 I didn't have many expectation going into the film, but I thought it was fantastic. <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> is outstanding in a very different role. He has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor. <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> and <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> play off each other great, and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time. The humor is dark, the performances by <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> are great, mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship, and you have a great film. This is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time. This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s career.
1662 0 Live! Yes, but not kicking.<br /><br />True story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show. A contest rather. The main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure. For real.<br /><br />The country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd, saying it was appalling, immoral, what-is-this-world-coming-to, and the like. In a way, I had to agree.<br /><br />As the months passed, the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not, instead of running the country.<br /><br />The show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead. And up to the last moment the country was up in arms, the Prime Minister making speeches, every newspaper writing about it, everyone in the country holding their breaths. And the network pushed on. Towards a new frontier in television. And they definitely succeeded in doing just that. They pushed the envelope.<br /><br />The show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live, whilst she would die shortly after.<br /><br />And then, in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. The woman was not ill, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, that, with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions, built up for months to a fantastic climax, was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors. The man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease.<br /><br />Now THIS is television. Leaving everybody far behind in amazement.<br /><br />Don't give me a poorly acted, poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a <ORGANIZATION>Russian Roulette</ORGANIZATION> show on American TV.<br /><br />As if.<br /><br />*Spoiler* As if I'm going to believe they would get this through the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION>. As if I'm going to believe this would get through the <ORGANIZATION>US Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> on the basis of free expression. As if I'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air.<br /><br />It's all been done before. Watch Running Man with <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION> instead. At least it had a semi good ending.<br /><br />*Spoiler* This is an appallingly bad piece of film, together with a ridiculous ending. So she gets shot in the end, is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Don't take my word for it, but I would say this: leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead, you'll get more quality.
1663 1 I saw this movie while it was under limited release, mainly for the novelty of seeing <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> with a moustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all year. It starts out almost as a thriller, but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one-liners and great comedic energy between <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>. Also, while I say this movie is a comedy, it doesn't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be. When I went into the theater I didn't know what to expect much more than a moustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Leaving the theater I felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big moustache.
1664 0 I give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. BUt I couldn't get past the implausibility of the whole thing.<br /><br />First and foremost, a game built around the notion of "Russian Roulette" that has to fill on hour. the big problem is that if you are doing a "live" show, you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the "real" bullet. Then what do you do? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that Okay, you get to the end and the first five contestants survive, which means number six has the bullet and can't possibly get the payout. He isn't going to shoot himself at that point, so it's kind of anti-climatic. <br /><br />second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People are going to flinch, panic, soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television. Too much randomness. That's why "real" Reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited.<br /><br />(The only random thing is the "performance artist's" rant about female sacrifices, which were actually rare historically. Even that was predictable, since she went through with shooting herself to no effect.) <br /><br />We are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 AM in the morning (unlikely) with the token Asian girl announcing each boost in ratings.<br /><br />A point on race and sex. Big surprise the movies two minority (one gay) and two female contestants are the ones who survive. So we are left with the two white males, and of course, the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show would be it's randomness, but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies.<br /><br />the Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide, the <PERSON>Eva Mendes</PERSON> character (<PERSON>Mendes</PERSON> produced and starred in this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself) actually grows a conscience when someone dies. What did she THINK was going to happen? She is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing (motives never explained) and the show went on to be a big hit. Really? <br /><br />the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous (like Network). This is neither.
1665 1 Interesting how much more realistic <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s performance is to that of the original <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> novels when compared to the bond films. He's neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. This is perfect break for him, even so much as to make fun of the bond icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself" he says. It doesn't get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is very much how <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON> had portrayed <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>. Personally I never liked <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> as <PERSON>Bond</PERSON> because he fit the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with, as compared to <PERSON>Roger Moore</PERSON> or <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>. Its great to see <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall. A shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with. It's an impressive portrayal, and having <PERSON>Greg Kinear</PERSON> to ground him, is just poetic. This movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in "My Blue Heaven", but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.
1666 0 There really wasn't much of a story in this film. It loosely based itself off the events in the first Lion King movie. It is supposed to be how Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> met via their aloneness. But there isn't much more than that.<br /><br />It mixes some scenes from the original, then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit. But still, is that it? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation.<br /><br />I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, then this is it. But other than that, it does little justice for the animators. Disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions. It really was quite boring and could have used <PERSON>Jason Statham</PERSON>. "D-"
1667 1 First let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Greg Kinear</PERSON> is pretty lackluster. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. It is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters come off realistically. So many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes... I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think of sideways when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall...
1668 0 I found this to be an utter waste of time, effort and money. I know Disney always displays lack of creativity when making "straight-to-video" films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is an all-time low...soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a "new version of the movie we all love." <PERSON>Nathan Lane</PERSON> surprisingly returns to his role of Timon yet again. Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> the animated animals from the world of the original "Lion King" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it REALLY happened...as they see it.<br /><br />Of course <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah...<br /><br />The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember <PERSON>Matthew Broderick</PERSON>, <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> or <PERSON>Nathan Lane</PERSON> being in anything of real commercial substance? Overall if you liked the original you'll hate this. It's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike. And that about sums it up.
1669 1 Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How does one make a comedy out of murder? It can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. So, the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work. So, <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis. He meets a struggling businessman, <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>, and after a rocky beginning, he learns that he needs a friend. But, <PERSON>Greg</PERSON>'s happily married to <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> sees in him the basic things he doesn't have, love, home and a life. Add character actor, <PERSON>Philip Baker Hall</PERSON> as the hit-man's manager and we're off to the races. Brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> delightful as his counterpart, the very human businessman. <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> adds a sparkle as <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>'s very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives. The ending is delightful and with some surprise to it. You should leave the theater feeling, at least, partly good-- if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people.
1670 0 Having watched both the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment ! <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> must be getting desperate for revenues.<br /><br />Especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.<br /><br />Basically, they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make a<br /><br />quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both of which had strong story lines.<br /><br />This movie hardly has a story at all. While the characters and animation are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> - Shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!<br /><br />Next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work.
1671 1 <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> the newest but no longer <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>, is an assassin. He is very very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. <PERSON>Greg Kinnair</PERSON> is really good as the straight and narrow business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious I never thought that <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> would be this funny, but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see.
1672 0 A dedicated fan to the TLK movies, with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> has produced, along comes this film... Now I'm not arguing with animation, voice work, music, but this is no more than a Timon/Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Although it isn't bad, it doesn't add anything. Basically this movie is one big joke... and that's about all that saves it. Make a real TLK3, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>! The potential is there.<br /><br />4/10
1673 1 This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies. <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> is also excellent as <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s straight man. I've read a few negative comments in here about <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. There are lots of good chuckles as <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing. My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> describes himself as a "facilitator". Much like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.
1674 0 I saw and liked the first two a lot, really. Especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. And it's a story standing alone. You don't have to know the first movie. I liked that in the "Free Willy" movies, too.<br /><br />But... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. But what for? Timon and <LOCATION>Pumba</LOCATION> were funny creatures in the first two movies. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. But what for? I'd really like to know. You know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes after is mostly unnecessary. I guess many people liked <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pumba</PERSON>, and so do I really. Yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. No chance, most of it wasn't funny at all, at least for me. Btw. what was the movie about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and <PERSON>Pumba</PERSON> or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I'm very disappointed about it.<br /><br />If you like to see stories like: "the story behind xy", you should see "<PERSON>Rosencrantz</PERSON> and Guildenstern Are Dead" by <PERSON>Tom Stoppard</PERSON> with <PERSON>Tim Roth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gary Oldman</PERSON>. That's really funny and no try to get more out of "Hamlet" then it has.
1675 1 "The Matador" is a dark comedy starring <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow, happily-married American businessman (<PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>) in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Although the sardonic <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> (ironically surnamed "Noble") appears to be a "tough guy" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless. Thus on his birthday, he reaches out to <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>, a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s "unconventional" lifestyle. In fact, both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter, franker moments of self-evaluation.<br /><br />Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of "Analyze This" and "Midnight Run" to feel entirely fresh and original, "The Matador," nevertheless, earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>, looking aged and almost used up, sinks his teeth into the role of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> in a way he never has before. Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being, <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> is flip and cavalier one moment, then genuine and sympathetic the next. He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale. <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> is also excellent as the Regular <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> deepens. Hope <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> does a fine job as "Bean," <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>'s loyal and loving wife who, like her husband, finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and "dangerous" figure from a world far different from the one she knows.<br /><br />At times, we find ourselves feeling that "The Matador" is holding something back from us, not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise. At the end it feels a little too light, a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should. This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director <PERSON>Richard Shephard</PERSON>, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet. Still, one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece, rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh.<br /><br />'The Matador" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will, hopefully, signal a new phase in <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s acting career.
1676 0 [CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]<br /><br /> Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> are watching The Lion King. <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> decides to go back BEFORE the beginning, to when the story really began. So they go back. Way back. Back even before <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> was born. Back to <PERSON>Timon</PERSON>'s old home which was miles away from <LOCATION>Pride Rock</LOCATION>. A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. The worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named Timon. His mother took pity on him but <PERSON>Uncle Max</PERSON> just shook his head. Mother suggested putting <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> on sentry duty; <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. Just then, hyenas <LOCATION>Shenzi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bonzai</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ed</PERSON> arrived and nearly killed poor <PERSON>Uncle Max</PERSON>. That did it. The other meerkats just wanted <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> to go away while <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> took it upon himself to leave. So he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. He didn't get very far before he started getting homesick. Just then he met <PERSON>Rafiki</PERSON>, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION>, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> join up then, but <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> declared them acquaintances, rather than friends.<br /><br /> They soon arrive at <LOCATION>Pride Rock</LOCATION> where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffe's, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. What was going on? <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> didn't care. They pressed on. Timon then saw <PERSON>Rafiki</PERSON> atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something he couldn't see. Just then all the animals took a bow. Was this to honor the birth of the new king? No, <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> suddenly find themselves heading down stream. When they reach land, <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> decides to give up. But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. It was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> named the place after a strange phrase he learned from <PERSON>Rafiki</PERSON>: <ORGANIZATION>Hakuna Matata</ORGANIZATION>. Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into <LOCATION>Simba</LOCATION>. They take him under their wing and become father figures. They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. Pretty soon, a teenage <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest. <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> won, leaving Timon deathly ill.<br /><br /> Then one day, <PERSON>Simba</PERSON>'s childhood friend <PERSON>Nala</PERSON> arrived. <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> just knew she'd break up the friendship. Suddenly, <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> runs away. Nala and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> race after him, but not Timon. He chose to stay at "Hakuna Matata" by himself, until <PERSON>Rafiki</PERSON> "talked" some sense into him, so he joins his friends at <LOCATION>Pride Rock</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Timon</PERSON>'s mother and Uncle <PERSON>Max</PERSON> arrive then. While <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> battles Scar, <PERSON>Mother</PERSON> and <PERSON>Max</PERSON> dig a large hole to trap hyenas <LOCATION>Shenzi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bonzai</PERSON> and Ed in. It worked. Scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. Then all is well. Mother, <PERSON>Uncle Max</PERSON> and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> in the paradise that is <PERSON>Hakuna Matata</PERSON>. Back to the present, <PERSON>Timon</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> finish the movie when suddenly Mother, <PERSON>Uncle Max</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Simba</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Rafiki</PERSON> want to watch it again. So do <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON>, <PERSON>Donald Duck</PERSON>, Goofy, <PERSON>Snow White</PERSON>, the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, <PERSON>Peter Pan</PERSON>, the Lost Boys, Mad Hatter, March <PERSON>Hare</PERSON>, Genie, Aladdin, and <PERSON>Jasmine</PERSON>.<br /><br /> Well, I must say that The Lion King 1 1/2 wasn't as good as I had hoped. It was too ridiculous and silly. The original Lion King was a masterpiece. It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. This one was just silly and made a mockery of it. I swear, sometimes Timon and <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION> are just way too overplayed. They're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. The original voice cast is back: <PERSON>Nathan Lane</PERSON> as <PERSON>Timon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ernie Sabella</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Pumbaa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Matthew Broddrick</PERSON> as Adult <PERSON>Simba</PERSON>, <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Shenzi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cheech Marin</PERSON> as <PERSON>Bonzai</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Cummings</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ed</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Guillame</PERSON> as <PERSON>Rafiki</PERSON>. New to the cast are <PERSON>Julie Kavner</PERSON> of TV's (Too) long running series The Simpsons as Timon's mom and <PERSON>Jerry Stiller</PERSON> as Uncle <PERSON>Max</PERSON>. So anyway, this movie isn't The Lion King III, and it isn't II because there already is a II. It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away. Hence, it's 1 1/2. In conclusion, I don't recommend this to die hard <ORGANIZATION>Lion King</ORGANIZATION> fans because it's far too ridiculous and frivilous. However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them. I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie. Two is enough. "The Lion King 1 1/2". What we've come to expect from <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> sequel makers.<br /><br />-
1677 1 ***1/2 <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adam Scott</PERSON>, <PERSON>Philip Baker Hall</PERSON>. Directed by <PERSON>Richard Shepard</PERSON>.<br /><br />A well formulated story and film all together, <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> has never been better in a film role outside of his "Bond" movies. After 2004's "After the sunset" his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time. Professional hit-man, so to speak, <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON> on a job in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man <PERSON>Danny Wright</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>, possibly one of his best roles) also on business there. The two on-screen duo produce a comically charged, laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> in one of her best roles since "American Splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. One of the years most enjoyable and best films. My final rating 9/10
1678 0 The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> guy went to the alleged killers location, Mr. <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an <ORGANIZATION>FBP</ORGANIZATION> agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. <PERSON>Xavier</PERSON> appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen. It would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.
1679 1 Think <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> and you think suave, dapper, intelligent <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>. In this movie, <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so (as does the audience). This is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman... and it works!<br /><br />This is a fun movie, with very good scenes (a riveting, on-the-edge Brosnan and a good, compliant "off"-the-edge <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> have some good lines). My only cavil is that <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>, playing the oh-so-tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") doesn't appear more often: she could have been a marvellous foil to these men.<br /><br />This movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience, while "going for a kill". The ending is awesome because a storyline (with a positive moral!) emerges: this is a frenetic, frantic and fun movie, which does deserve a wide audience.
1680 0 I agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made .I too had to fast forward through most of this movie. <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> must have done this movie as a favor to someone.The picture quality is grainy all the way through .And what little plot there is,is just plain stupid .I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I could give it a lower score I would .Don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it.
1681 1 Wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I love watching <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> in any movie, he's always good, but this was totally different. He's a mess, and plays being a mess very well. In fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni :) So yes, there's not a lot of violence, there's not a lot of action, but the dialogue is cracking, the acting is superb and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny too :) I don't think you'll come out of the cinema going "Wow! I was blown away", but you'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film. Can't ask for more than that.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're lucky, some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you'll get inverted, upside down, reversed (with reversed audio) adverts!! Brilliant. Nothing like watching a Jack Daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff American "Twin Peaks" commentary :)
1682 0 I just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just watched. Mainly I think it's a film about an internet S&M "star" of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. She's murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of <LOCATION>Big City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic "as the real thing". I know. Wow.<br /><br /><PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him. He's in the film for about 15 minutes, and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason. I won't even explain the ending, because quite frankly I can't make it out myself. But before the final scene, we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. Honestly, they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.<br /><br />All in all, stay away from this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON>. I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.
1683 1 I found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy. Brosnan is genius; as anyone will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role. <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I've laughed as hard during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favourite line would be 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse. I was also very impressed with <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>'s performance. It seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will definitely like this. <br /><br />I voted 10.
1684 0 This is not <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON>'s fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Sorry <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>. The cinematography was dark. All the other actors are unknowns. When watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual overtones, since it is about a underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, except <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON>'s parts. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. It is something I would not be proud of. It is not even a B movie for cable, it is more like a F and it should never be shown, ever.
1685 1 The Matador is a witty, dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, who has never ever been better than here, and the always reliable <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> who has his best role here since playing <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>'s gay neighbor in As Good As It Gets. A big plus goes to the writing as well. Clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way. The story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next.<br /><br />Nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film. But that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat.
1686 0 A BDSM "sub-culture" of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess, plainly a vanity piece for its top-billed player, <PERSON>Celia Xavier</PERSON>, who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> and <PERSON>Celia</PERSON>. A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer. <PERSON>Celia</PERSON> is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD-ROMS, but when disaster befalls "Mistress <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON>", virtuous <PERSON>Celia</PERSON>, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a "sex slave" at the private <ORGANIZATION>Castle Club</ORGANIZATION> where the specialty of the house is a "dungeon party". Two <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> field agents (whose deployment to the <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites), in addition to a <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police Department</ORGANIZATION> homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for <PERSON>Celia</PERSON> whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D.'s <ORGANIZATION>Operations-South Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film. Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario. One solid acting turn appears among this slag: <PERSON>Stan Abe</PERSON> as a zealous <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent.
1687 1 Not to mention easily <PERSON>Pierce Brosnon</PERSON>'s best performance. Of course <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> is always great. Really, when has he really been bad? I think this film is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this movie is something very different in today's film world where every other movie has the Payback blue filter. I also love the way they used the song by <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. Proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly.<br /><br />I was making my first feature when this came out. Being that my film was a hit-man movie, I had to check out anything in the genre that was released. After seeing it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was pretty cool when my film got on the IMDb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine. How any of the others relate I have no idea, making an even more interesting coincidence.<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
1688 0 This has to be the worst movie I have seen. <PERSON>Madsen</PERSON> fans don't be drawn into this like I was. He is only in it for a maximum of five minutes. This movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t.v. had been destroyed.
1689 1 A chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives. This is an odd film that works, an impressive effort for writer-director <PERSON>Shepard</PERSON>. In a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job, but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope. <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> is equally good as the salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> is fine as <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>'s flirtatious wife. Mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
1690 0 It is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! In fact I would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars. <br /><br />I, like many others, bought this film thinking that because it has <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> in it, it could be good... No chance! This film was shocking! Imagine a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful', well, Primal Instinct did not even come close to that good, and I had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. <br /><br /><PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON>, how could you do this to us? The worst part is, I didn't fast forward a bit, I was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film.<br /><br />Where do I start...? Directing - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Make-up - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half a Star, Graphic Design - Half a Star, DVD Menu - Half a Star.<br /><br />However I think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is, so for that reason I am happy that I saw this film, just so that I have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list.
1691 1 The Matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it, it seems so light. The humor is always medium-gauge, never unfunny but never gut-busting. The story is a very simple thread. The characteristics of the plot are often recycled features, namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight-laced glass-wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other's lifestyles. I also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary, as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself. However, it really is a good film, because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time, it wasn't. It has a subtle way of connecting with the audience.<br /><br />I believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it's a formula that is nothing new, even most of the humor, both main characters, virtually the only characters in it, are somehow met and gotten to know. Forget calling them real. That's not at all what I mean. What I mean is that though <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>'s filthy, womanizing, boozing hit man is a detached comical character, he's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>, who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh <PERSON>James Bondless</PERSON> air. <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>'s character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness, but he's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later. We then realize the film is not simply Analyze This or Planes, Trains and Automobiles told stalely over again. Its truly saying something.<br /><br />The film's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists. But with its lightness, how can that possibly be the focus of the film, though the plot has been leading up to it? No, the focus is what <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> get out of their unlikely relationship to each other. Strangely, The Matador is a film about regret and loneliness. Brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day, and though we don't understand why <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> is so lenient and accepting with <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> continually interrupting his life, it's slowly understood that <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> is salvaging <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> from a more down-to-earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption. The very last scene of the movie stays with me. It, I think, is where the film's subtle side-stepping impact finally begins to seep.
1692 0 This has to be, by far, the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that <PERSON>Michael Madsen</PERSON> was in it I figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films, and he was a pretty fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this film. I fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and I don't feel that I missed a thing.
1693 1 Two years ago I watched "The Matador" in cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally under impression of <PERSON>Pierce Brosan</PERSON>'s magnificent role. Yesterday, I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper. Now, I can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man. <br /><br />Brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON>, tired hit-man who has no friends. Soon <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> meets <PERSON>Danny Wright</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>) in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident, his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (<PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>).<br /><br />I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor. Mostly that humor comes from <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> hooker on a Sunday morning, after the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION>'s left town." <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually. I also like <PERSON>Greg</PERSON> 'typical American face' <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like <PERSON>Danny Wright</PERSON>.<br /><br />So I recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> ever. He'll make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in not equally great movie.
1694 0 The movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.<br /><br />I honestly didn't like the style of the movie. I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much of it. The movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all. It gives the comic book like experience. However it's visually numbing the viewer, it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs, monotonic scenes, dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises.<br /><br />The movie's storyline is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts.<br /><br />I will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit.
1695 1 <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON> (<PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>) is a hit-man. Or a "facilitator of fatalities", as he prefers to be called. He is also a drunk, a womaniser, and in the middle of a mid-life crisis. On a job in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, he bumps into <PERSON>Danny White</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>), an unconfident businessman who thinks he's just nailed a recent pitch, but is unsure. They meet in the hotel bar late one night, after they've both had a few too many margaritas.<br /><br />Sounds like the set-up for a by-the-numbers comedy thriller, doesn't it? But it isn't. Instead, The Matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study. It avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest, sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down. It is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it, without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances.<br /><br /><PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s hit-man will inevitably be compared to his <PERSON>Bond</PERSON>, but this is unfair to both performances. Bond is a half-formed idea, a product of all that has gone before; while <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws. He has existed in his own shadowy, seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being.<br /><br />When he meets <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> in the hotel bar, he sees his opposite: a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems. He envies <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>; the hit-man has become fed up with his life, sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable "burn out", as he puts it. But when <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> opens up about the death of his only son, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> tries to change the subject with a dirty joke. He is a man who has, in his own words, been "running from any emotion." <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> holds his own opposite <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s performance, and injects <PERSON>Danny White</PERSON> with his effortless everyman charm. He is the perfect foil to <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>; while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism, <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> is down to earth, with just a hint of eccentricity. But he too goes deeper than his established persona, showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruin.<br /><br />There is real chemistry between <LOCATION>Brosnan</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>. It is most visible in the film's three key scenes: the hotel bar; a bullfight, during which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> what he does for a living, and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination; and a scene in which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> turns up at <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>'s house six months later. This scene also introduces us properly to <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>'s wife, Bean (yes, Bean). In another example of how much The Matador respects its characters, Bean (<PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>), instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house, merely asks with forced calm, "Did you bring your gun?" The script isn't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite. One or two lines seem a little forced, and a couple of the jokes need a little more work. But in the scenes where <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> (and later Bean) just talk, the writing is superb. The film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations (other than meeting a hit-man, and said hit-man turning up on your doorstep). It just lets them talk, gently nudging them toward necessary plot points.<br /><br />There is action, but only when it reflects on the characters. One notable instance is when <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> botches a job in <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope. The rest of the film is about the characters, how they interact, how they each affect one another. And, ultimately, it is about friendship, even in the most unlikely of places. At one point <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> that he is his only friend. And he really means it.
1696 0 OK, If you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong film.<br /><br />I revolves around two brothers. <PERSON>Max</PERSON>, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. It however, does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. Most of the movie focus is on <PERSON>Max</PERSON> and his parting ways. Eventually <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs).<br /><br />This movie has almost no climax. Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, <PERSON>Adam</PERSON>, is horrific.<br /><br />I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference.<br /><br />Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy. Try and see for yourself...
1697 1 The turning point in "The Matador" comes about half through the movie when <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>, an unsophisticated man from <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, is sitting in the balcony of his <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. But did he really? <br /><br /><PERSON>Richard Shephard</PERSON>, the director of "The Matador", presents us with a character, <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON>, who shows no redeemable qualities. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> meets <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> at the bar of the Camino Real in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living.<br /><br /><PERSON>Danny</PERSON>, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract. <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>. It's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>'s door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>. It's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way.<br /><br /><PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON>. Just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character. <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer. <PERSON>Philip Baker Hall</PERSON> puts an appearance as the liaison between <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and his assignments.<br /><br /><PERSON>Richard Shephard</PERSON> directs with style working with his own material. The musical score is by <PERSON>Rolfe Kent</PERSON> and the crisp cinematography of <PERSON>David Tattersall</PERSON> enhances everything.
1698 0 <ORGANIZATION>One Star</ORGANIZATION>. That's all this documentary deserves. I haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, in quite some time.<br /><br />I'm a BIG fan of the "Walking With..." series, including it's <PERSON>Nigel Marvin</PERSON> spin-offs, for all their gleeful fun yet informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other docs from the series, I figured I need to see this one as well, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places.<br /><br />Well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc... what were you thinking?! lol.<br /><br />Though the information that they were able to get through was interesting, the presentation failed in every other way possible. It had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say (with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place), horrible effects (that includes the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects), and overused MTV-style camera effects.<br /><br />Speaking of the makeup effects, one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie. Well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.<br /><br />The worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or looks remotely real. It doesn't even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in "Walking With Dinosaurs" of the fate of the Ornithochirus (sp?)? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it. It's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all. When you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts surrounding it.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration (at least in the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, DO NOT bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh (which I did frequently, but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not belong on the shelf with the other "Walking With..." docs.<br /><br />And does it make sense to learn that this doc was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm...
1699 1 The Matador is a strange film. Its main character <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>, is not your typical hero. <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises. Having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely. And so, after a chance meeting at a bar with <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>), he latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship. <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well. The two make an unexpected connection, and <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> sticks around to hear <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s story, even after learning the "unsavory" truth about <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s work.<br /><br />Matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'Assassins' and '<ORGANIZATION>Grosse Pointe Blank</ORGANIZATION>' come to mind). But Matador differs in several key ways. First of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you. And second, unlike most anti-hero films, <PERSON>Matador</PERSON> makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character. <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing. This is unusual, given that 99.99% of us would consider killing for money horrific. And yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic. Although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder. Did <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s victims deserve to die? Who is paying to have people killed? Who knows. The movie never deals with these questions. The focus is on <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship. If you read about someone like <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity. Sympathy for the devil, I guess.<br /><br /><PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s take on <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is well done and deeply unsettling. He doesn't completely divorce himself from his <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix. Weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance. It keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him. It's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays, but it works. The films only other major role, that of <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>, is not nearly as meaty. <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> with a regular <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> life and problems.<br /><br />The film doesn't really have any huge shocks or M Night Shyamalan twists, but I wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying. It doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human. And it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet I thought the pacing was well done and I was never bored. Maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites. Even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people. It's a comment on the strange, random world we live in. A good film; worth seeing.
1700 0 This has got to be the most stupid film I have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find that the kid has a gift, the "Shining". This gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. Then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. Why else would he do it? All of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. Then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on IMDb.
1701 1 THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Philip Baker Hall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dylan Baker</PERSON>. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on assignment in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> where he befriends a square yet likable American businessman (<PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> at his most affable) and discovers there is more to life than death. Newbie filmmaker <PERSON>Richard Shepard</PERSON> makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee. A sleeper gem indie hit.
1702 0 After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie.<br /><br />********** SPOILERS **********<br /><br />1. The casting. <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> barely fits into <PERSON>Jack Torrence</PERSON>'s character. Also, I would have NEVER picked <PERSON>Shelly Duvall</PERSON> for <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>. I pictured <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON> much differently. I can see why they picked <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. He's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> was alright, he needed more life though. He acted way to droney.<br /><br />2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated.<br /><br />3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly, <PERSON>Halorann</PERSON> died, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> froze to death, <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON> never got hurt...The Overlook didn't blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, I was apalled. <PERSON>Hallorann</PERSON> was never supposed to die, but <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least have <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.<br /><br />There are other things that I didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. I applaud <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Kubrik</ORGANIZATION> any more. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.<br /><br />Rating: 2/10
1703 1 <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> has sipped his last <PERSON>Martini</PERSON> and returns, in an outrageous self-parody, as the aging foul-mouthed boozy assassin <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON>, who has a particular fondness for teenage girls, bullfights and tacky clothes. During a job in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> he meets <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>), a straight-faced Denver suburban business-man, who's in town to make his deal of-a-life-time, in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s crude and insensible remarks, they become friends. <br /><br />Largely carried by the performances of <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>, director <PERSON>Richard Shepard</PERSON> revealed that he didn't write the film with <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> in mind , but I can hardly imagine this without him. He proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> or cold-war spies. The scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) really is a bravura piece of acting skills. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably carefully scripted, the two actors are largely improvising, but they succeed wonderfully! It almost feels like a new standard in screen acting. Think of <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harvey Keitel</PERSON> in MEAN STEETS improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichÃ©s and the actors' own typecasting (<ORGANIZATION>Brosnan</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> in particular), and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. <br /><br />Sadly, the story wears thin after a while. After an hour, the film just runs out of steam. Nevertheless, and I can't put my finger on it exactly, I did enjoy this very much. It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to <PERSON>Seijun Suzuki</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Melville</PERSON>. The other characters aren't given much to do, but this film does offer something new, in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof. Very amusing.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 7/10
1704 0 I am going to keep this short.This "adaption" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nickolson</PERSON> fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> is laughable as <PERSON>Torrance</PERSON> and so is <PERSON>Shelley Duvall.The</PERSON> story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wendy Torrance</PERSON> are complete jokes.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....<br /><br />Oh ,and the people who are saying that <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> had every right to destroy the King story cause <PERSON>King</PERSON> is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing "masterpieces" like "eyes wide shut".
1705 1 THE MATADOR is hit-man movie lite....if you can say that about a hit-man movie. The violence is never really shown but often introduced. At first I was scared I was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy BUT was happily surprised when I realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy. Good film.
1706 0 Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>'s performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was <PERSON>Stanley Kubrick</PERSON> thinking drafting <PERSON>Shelly</PERSON> as the <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.
1707 1 "The Matador" stars <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> as a burned out assassin. He's <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> gone to seed, in too-tight, garish clothes, gold chains, and an ugly haircut. Our struggling assassin, <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON>, is in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, trying to regain his nerve. Staying at the same hotel is a likable, down-on-his luck businessman <PERSON>Danny Wright</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>), also trying to regain his equilibrium. <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> (<PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON>) with good news.<br /><br />Noble and <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> unexpectedly become friends. <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques, which he demonstrates at a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. <br /><br />Writer and director <PERSON>Richard Shepard</PERSON> did the Q&A after this delightful movie at the Austin Film Festival. <PERSON>Shepard</PERSON> was also down on his luck. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts, he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play. Then <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> called. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> regains his equilibrium in this movie. (There is life after <PERSON>Bond</PERSON>!) He has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy. Don't miss it. <br /><br />Stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more of <PERSON>Richard Shepard</PERSON>'s projects.
1708 0 Ladies and Gentlemen,please don't get fooled by "A Stanley Kubrick" film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> is not alive to make any changes.
1709 1 "Margaritas and Cock..."<br /><br />This tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs, surprises and unexpectedly touching moments. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost any other film from 2005. It is a wacky film with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON> (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs (assassinating rich dudes). He is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis. After coming to realization that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into <PERSON>Danny Wright</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>).<br /><br /><PERSON>Danny</PERSON> is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him. He loves his wife dearly, especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier.<br /><br />The two men are chalk and cheese, hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night. And somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever.<br /><br />The friendship they form reminded me a lot of <LOCATION>Laurel</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON>. One is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble. The interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned, due in no small part to the wonderful performances from <LOCATION>Brosnan</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>.<br /><br />But make no mistake... This is <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s film. He imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him. Brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer, but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date. I wouldn't be averse to seeing an Oscar nod for this role.<br /><br />Consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line, "All blushy blushy... No sucky fucky". He does it with the familiar Bond smirk and manages to get away with it. He manages to tell a young boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years. Then get back to me" without coming across as unlikable. In fact, it makes us like him even more.<br /><br />And yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes, most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns. However, when <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> and his wife (<PERSON>Davis</PERSON>) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion.<br /><br />"The Matador" is stylish and energetic. It is constantly entertaining. And it contains a career-defining role for <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life. This is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>TC Candler</ORGANIZATION> of IndependentCritics.com
1710 0 Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and was expecting it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and environment was good, but there was no story here. Not was there a single moment of fright. I expected it to a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing "Wednesday". There are lots of fragments i the movie. Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown. Might be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not for the 21st century.
1711 1 This film is fantastic. Finally well-written characters you can love for all their good and bad. <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role. I think its the best thing he's ever done. He's done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully-fledged work, but this role finally gave him the room to run with it. I almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> are a couple to aspire too, as well as actors to aspire too. <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON> is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying. You give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back.
1712 0 These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.
1713 1 The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> is alone worth the price of admission. He plays a kind of "<PERSON>James Bond</PERSON>'s psycho twin brother", separated at birth, no doubt. As an intense hit-man, his character is very sexual but even better, very funny. Add the kind-hearted, uber-likable American "guy next door', <PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON>, to set up contrast. The myriad locations, vivid colors, and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment. <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> is well cast as the "gem of a wife". But the focus of the film is on the two fellows, a new "Odd Couple", and that's the part that works very well. Have a great (probably R-rated) laugh, and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper.
1714 0 Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. I'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow up with the question "Really... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none...), names the "Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators" shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.<br /><br />One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr <PERSON>Halloran</PERSON> up to the Overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes <PERSON>Halloran</PERSON> FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. <br /><br />Oh, and nice choice for Mr. <PERSON>Halloran</PERSON>'s artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more "off," out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?<br /><br />I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> fan-boys, who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in front of them. <br /><br />Toss in the grotesque overacting of <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>, the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments, and the Razzie nominated performance of <PERSON>Shelly Duvall</PERSON> and you have a very crappy movie.
1715 1 Greetings again from the darkness. Much anticipated, twisted comedy from writer/director <PERSON>Richard Shepard</PERSON> is a coming out party for <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> the actor. That Bond guy is gone. This new guy is something else entirely!! Have read that <PERSON>Shepard</PERSON> thought <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> proves to be the perfect <PERSON>Julian Noble</PERSON>, "Facilitator" ... and is anything but pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect. <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON> takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold.<br /><br /><PERSON>Greg Kinnear</PERSON> is the straight guy to <PERSON>Brosnan</PERSON>'s comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. <PERSON>Hope Davis</PERSON> has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as <PERSON>Kinnear</PERSON>'s wife (what's with her name "Bean"?) who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room.<br /><br />The visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> suburb. And how often do we get The Killers and <PERSON>Xavier Cugat</PERSON> on the same soundtrack? This one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film-making, it could be for you.
1716 0 I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON> escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. <PERSON>Halloran</PERSON>! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important. Overall, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off.
1717 1 This film has a rotting core of flexible morality, and yet a quirky sense of justice. So many of the regular Joes among us would love to "stick it to the MAN". The "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. <PERSON>Keller</PERSON>, who <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> reports to at her office. Later, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> owes 70 large to Mr. <PERSON>Marchand</PERSON> the club owner. And then there is <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s Parole Officer. There seems to be so much question about this last character's side story. Reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonists, escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically. They are beholden to each agent of the "MAN". One or both could be fired, killed, or imprisoned if they don't do as they are told.<br /><br />The film has a sense of relief at the end. <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> finally gets laid. Her boss is forced out for being a jerk. Mr. <PERSON>Club Owner</PERSON> is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom. They get the $money$. And... they need not worry about reporting in to the Parole Officer, because HIS moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). It is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight. Never mind that someone else may get <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s file later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free! They might even get away with it! <br /><br />Woohoo...<br /><br />They STUCK IT TO THE MAN!
1718 0 I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released. Many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Kubrick</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Steven King</PERSON>. The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed "master" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. "Salem's Lot" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series, directed by <PERSON>Tobe Hooper</PERSON> (he of "<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Chainsaw Massacre" fame) and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a "Chiller Theatre" vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. Fans hoped that a director of <ORGANIZATION>Kubrick</ORGANIZATION>'s stature would succeed where <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> had failed. It didn't happen.<br /><br />Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it's all downhill. <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> cannot be anything but <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>. He's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here. I don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this clinker, the "Here's <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON>!" bit notwithstanding...he's just awful in this movie. So is everyone else, for that matter. <PERSON>Scatman Crothers</PERSON>' character, <PERSON>Dick Halloran</PERSON>, was essential to the plot of the book, yet <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> kills him off in one of the lamest "shock" sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. King's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom.<br /><br />This movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me.
1719 1 It's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn. Surprises throughout delighting throughout.<br /><br />A couple of things I could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays "the good girl, hard worker" and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker. That was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause.<br /><br />The other thing I could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film. I never did get who he was or what his issues were. If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear what they might be.<br /><br />The film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing. Very much worth seeing.
1720 0 <ORGANIZATION>Kubrick</ORGANIZATION> meets King. It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since.<br /><br />The King cultists say <PERSON>Stanley Kubrick</PERSON> took a great horror tale and ruined it. The <ORGANIZATION>Kubrick</ORGANIZATION> cultists don't give a damn about <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s story. They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.This is a film, they insist: It should be considered on its own. As it happens, both camps are correct. Unfortunately.<br /><br />If one views it purely as an adaptation of <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION>'s novel, "The Shining" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits. <br /><br />I used to blame that on <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON>'s screenwriter. The writer <PERSON>Diane Johnson</PERSON> (author of Le Marriage, <PERSON>L'Affaire</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Le Divorce</ORGANIZATION>, etc.) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. Maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. But the little blue-collar town of <LOCATION>Sidewinder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> doesn't exist on any map in her Francophile universe. <br /><br /><PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> the Anglophile probably found her congenial, however. He, of course, is the real auteur. And considered on its own merits, his screenplay for "The Shining" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation -- just doesn't stand up to logical analysis.<br /><br />I'm willing to consider <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON>'s "Shining" on its own terms. I'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie. But it doesn't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness either. Parsed either way, the film pretty much falls apart.<br /><br />Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little <PERSON>Danny Torrance</PERSON>, then as the hallucinations of his father? One notes how whenever <PERSON>Jack Torrance</PERSON> is seen talking to a "ghost" he is in fact looking into a mirror. One notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s stunted, convoluted psyche. Very deep stuff.<br /><br />But if indeed the Overlook's "ghosts" are purely manifestations of <PERSON>Jack Torrance</PERSON>'s growing insanity, then who exactly lets the trapped <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet, so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage?<br /><br />And can ANYONE explain, with a straight face, that black-and-white photograph (helpfully labelled "1921") of <PERSON>Nicholson</PERSON> as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds? Are we to seriously conclude that <PERSON>Jack Torrance</PERSON>'s Bad Craziness stems from a some sort of "past life" experience? (And if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)<br /><br />Maybe <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> didn't care about his storyline. Maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. Whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This movie hasn't improved with age, and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings.<br /><br />I don't deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long, long film. But those gushing Elevators o' Blood, seen repeatedly in little <PERSON>Danny</PERSON>'s visions, are absurd and laughable. And <PERSON>Jack Torrance</PERSON>'s infamous tag lines ("<PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>, I'm home!" and "Heeeeeere's <PERSON>JOHNNY</PERSON>!") merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: "Whew! Glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!") Finally, <PERSON>Kubrick</PERSON> is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON> wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. A foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I really am afraid.<br /><br />Given <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>'s brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling, eyebrow-wiggling, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. The performance of <PERSON>Shelley Duvall</PERSON>, as a sort of female version of <PERSON>Don Knotts</PERSON> in "The Ghost and Mr. <PERSON>Chicken</PERSON>," is best passed over in silence.<br /><br />This movie simply doesn't succeed -- not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. It probably merits a 3 out of 10, but I'm giving it a 1 because it has been so GROTESQUELY over-rated in this forum.
1721 1 <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> made here a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman, in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected... Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail. Their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. Characters'description is profund, goes into details...both start to help each other; for she can read on lips, which reveals itself to be very useful for him...She will progressively evolve, far from what she was at first.<br /><br />It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a film noir at the end. Gesture is in particular beautifully observed in <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON>'s filming. <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON> should be nominated at the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistral play. Action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". It's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10.
1722 0 A disappointing film.<br /><br />The story established our protagonist as <PERSON>Chrissy</PERSON>, a 'young', rather sullen individual drifting, not doing much. Actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives. It's a pity though, <PERSON>Chrissy</PERSON> seem like interesting character.<br /><br />Story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated. So the question now is, when are we going to see the Campions, Jacksons, and the <PERSON>Tamahori</PERSON>'s breaking ground with compelling, cinematically-told stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br /><br />Technically, a disgusting shot film.
1723 1 What can you say when you see a good French movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters? The major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together. It's simple and really efficient. The background story is less important. Why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most French film-jerkers like to make. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes lÃ¨vres is only an entertaining French film with good characterization.<br /><br />For all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy. It goes quite as easy as in Rear Window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context. Where I am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before. <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON> is not a new-comer yet. Strange and weird.
1724 0 'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon GetrÃ¤umte SÃ¼nden', is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics, since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever. Apparently, this is one of the better of his 180+ films Â– it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.<br /><br />The unfathomable plot deals with <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>'s usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M for good measure, and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.<br /><br />I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again Â– life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this.
1725 1 <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she finds herself overloaded at work, she is able to hire <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> to help her out. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> is just out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him. To say too much more about the story, which has many twists, would be a mistake.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> can hear and when she can't -- a sort of "point of hear" (like point of view). The early scenes that set this up, as well as the early character development of <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on, some of which were hard to follow and/or stretched credibility a bit. There is also some unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing, but perhaps not seeking out. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
1726 0 I've come to realise from watching Euro horror, especially films made by cult luminary <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON>, that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense. However, <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> has gone overboard with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - Succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film. I've got to admit that I saw the American cut version, which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing S&M and talking rubbish, and it's all really boring. There's no gore and the sex is dull, and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had difficulty making it all the way to the end. I have to say that the locations look good and <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money, and overall I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works.
1727 1 I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. It is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. The real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. It's the sort of film <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> really wants to make, but just can't.
1728 0 Even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often named as THE best <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker <PERSON>Fritz Lang</PERSON> counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. So, maybe it's me but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie. The opening is great, though, and shows <PERSON>Janine Reynaud</PERSON> performing an SM act on stage. It's all downhill from here, unfortunately. <PERSON>Reynaud</PERSON>'s character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score. This COULD have been his greatest film indeed, if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic but I'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. Half of the time, you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages. This most certainly isn't <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>'s best film according to me. I wouldn't even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans. If you're looking for more superior <PERSON>Jess Franco</PERSON> film, try to get your hands on '<PERSON>Las Vampiras</PERSON>', 'The awful Dr. <PERSON>Orloff</PERSON>' or 'Female Vampire'.
1729 1 Surely one the French films of the decade so far, a taut, atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema. <PERSON>Emannuelle Devos</PERSON> gives a truly stunning , multi-faceted performance, at times devious and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
1730 0 I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad film. It fails on pretty much all levels; the cast is awful, the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth, leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines.<br /><br />Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy.<br /><br />A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie.
1731 1 <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON> plays the part of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meets <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>, a secretary who is Â‘quite deaf', when she has her hearing aids in Â‘very deafÂ‘ when not (played by <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>). Together they help each other to develop as people.<br /><br />What was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters Â– not fitting into obvious stereotypes. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> appears uneasy in the office environment, is it that he's just not cut out for work? This belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines.<br /><br />The film has a certain amorality which I find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified.<br /><br />Finally, it is a film full of great Â‘moments' both touching and humorous. One is when <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby. She continues to cuddle it Â– but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort.
1732 0 "Plan B" is strictly by-the-numbers fare except for one thing. I surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jon Cryer</PERSON> is the "star" of this film and plays his usual, smarmy, egotistical, snotty character that was actually endearing in "Pretty In Pink" and has NOT been amusing ever since. Grating doesn't even begin to describe his performance. <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mark Matheisen</PERSON>) is a muscular, blonde, struggling actor who (gasp!) is only worried about his hair and getting laid. Talk about a stock character...ugh. At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging. <PERSON>Lisa Darr</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lance Guest</PERSON> play a grounded, optimistic, caring couple who are struggling to conceive. Since they are not whiny drama queens, however, their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren't given enough screen time. <PERSON>Sara Mornell</PERSON> rounds out the cast by playing <PERSON>Gina</PERSON>, your usual nice and good-looking young woman who just can't seem to find the right partner in love. I've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.<br /><br />What startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes. They introduced a Russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked. He was portrayed as being wild, ignorant and amazingly shallow. They were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays. <PERSON>Gina</PERSON> decides to be gay for a while since she isn't having any luck with guys. Honestly. That wasn't that bad except they really went overboard when <PERSON>Gina</PERSON> brought a lesbian to a Christmas party her friends were throwing. Her lesbian date had very short hair (like I'm sure all lesbians do). She also got quite upset (like I'm sure all lesbians do) when <PERSON>Gina</PERSON> had the nerve to put on lipstick(!). Finally, her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when <PERSON>Gina</PERSON> expresses her disappointment. Of course, we all know how gay people can't stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years, right? (Please note the sarcasm in that statement. Thank you.)<br /><br />This film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but <PERSON>Cryer</PERSON>'s unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema. 2/10
1733 1 Put yourself into <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s shoes. She is an overworked, unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible. You know her: she's trained three of her last three bosses, knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. Always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability, she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled. What? You don't want to hear it? Well, she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place. Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired.<br /><br /><PERSON>Carla</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>) needs a change in her life. Work is leading nowhere; friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. She won't take a vacation - a contract is going critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> submits requirements that convey her real needs: a 'well-groomed' man. This brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. <br /><br /><PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Vincent Cassell</PERSON>) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s interest in his non-job-related qualities. She sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds, their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependence. <br /><br /><PERSON>Paul</PERSON> has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison: one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt. His skills as a thief help <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> win a political battle in the office. But <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> sees a grander opportunity with <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue.<br /><br />This is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens. <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> grows more powerful, professionally as well as personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us. She grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world.<br /><br />The two main characters are meant for each other, in a strange way. Without <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> will remain in her role of a doormat. She has our sympathy, hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't make the best decisions along the way. <br /><br />You will hear the world through <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s ears, from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid, muffled sounds, all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking. With one major sense disabled, we see <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s heightened intuitive power to compensate. And we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.
1734 0 I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite sick by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>'s 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and <PERSON>Michael Hanneke</PERSON>'s 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening. And when the film climaxed in an "orgy" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema.
1735 1 As in Amelie, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant, centered on a female finding her one true love. In this case, desperation leads to a convict, which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype. Clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male.<br /><br />For those of us that don't speak French, the subtitles are a little quick, but not unreasonable.<br /><br />The soundtrack, as seems to be increasingly the case with European films, is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of various urban horror movies. There's a <PERSON>Wes Craven</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> feel to it.
1736 0 Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who don't say much, just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny.<br /><br />Black comedy? There isn't a black person in it, and there isn't one funny thing in it either.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Walmart</ORGANIZATION> buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. It's labeled Unrated. I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken out other stuff too, who knows? All we know is that whatever they took out, isn't there any more.<br /><br />The acting seemed OK to me. There's a lot of unfathomables tho. It's supposed to be a city? It's supposed to be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves, why are they all wearing coats?
1737 1 What is very French about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters. This might require a bit of patience, especially since neither is "attractive" in the typical <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> definition of such. However, once the "heist" kicks in, the film rushes forward quickly, perhaps at times too quickly. But it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable. The kind of film that you know <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> would have botched up.
1738 0 Where to start... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price I paid, got it from <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>), this movie was meant to be a thriller. The only THRILL I got was watching <PERSON>Kirkland</PERSON>'s lousy rendition of <PERSON>Anne Wilkes</PERSON> from Misery sans snowy woodland area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don't even bother.<br /><br />I for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. But Wow... I Meant WOW!! The only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy, played by <PERSON>Vincent Berry</PERSON>. The only reason why I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
1739 1 Deaf secretary <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues.<br /><br />When they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult, but, when the first applicant is ex-con <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON>) she seizes the chance to change her life.<br /><br /><PERSON>Carla</PERSON> covers his mistakes and he, anxious to go straight, reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues.<br /><br />When <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> asks <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> to return the favor, she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld, ruled by ruthless lone shark <PERSON>Marchand</PERSON> (<PERSON>Olivier Gourmet</PERSON>).<br /><br />Recognizing her ability to lip-read as a weapon no one will have bargained for, the two set out to see justice done.<br /><br />French filmmaker <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>'s third feature "Read My Lips" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller.
1740 0 Towards the end of this thriller Ally <PERSON>Sheedy</PERSON>'s gaunt latter-day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image. She convinces one that, if a nasty <PERSON>Bette Davis-type</PERSON> role were to come her way, she could carry it off brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can't find many other reasons for seeing this. If you've wondered what <PERSON>Sheedy</PERSON> looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) then here's your answer. For the rest, <PERSON>Sally Kirkland</PERSON>'s sex-starved crazy woman is really tiresome, and even if you like this sort of thing more than I do you'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes. <PERSON>Savage</PERSON>'s drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role. Of the leading actors, <PERSON>Nicholas Walker</PERSON> inspires no sympathy at all for <PERSON>Paul Keller</PERSON>'s plight and his acting is wooden. <PERSON>Dara Tomanovich</PERSON> is better and during her scenes with <PERSON>Sheedy</PERSON> the level rises a little. <PERSON>Sheedy</PERSON>'s meticulous, understated performance (though she often seems to be on automatic pilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest. The sets are drab, the camera-work undistinguished.
1741 1 "Read My Lips (Sur mes lÃ¨vres)" (which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its French title) is a nifty, twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope.<br /><br />The two leads are magnetic, <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON> (who I've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in French movies) and an even more disheveled than usual <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON> (who has brought a sexy and/or threatening look and voice to some <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> movies).<br /><br />The first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte. The second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu.<br /><br />Writer/director <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON> very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrÃ©e for us into her perceptions, turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk), using visuals as sensory reactors as well.<br /><br />None of the characters act as anticipated (she is not like that pliable victim from "In the Company of Men," not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line (well, until the last shot, but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office, to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs. <br /><br />There is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary, but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites of the year! <br /><br />(originally written 7/28/2002)
1742 0 <PERSON>Nicholas Walker</PERSON> is <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, the local town Reverand who's married to <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ally Sheedy</PERSON>), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, <PERSON>Veronica</PERSON> (<PERSON>Dara Tomanovich</PERSON>). However in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). <PERSON>Sally Kirkland</PERSON> is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of "Misery" type of way. It's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Not the least bit <PERSON>John Savage</PERSON> in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film billed as a 'black comedy', one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie. While this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. Furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them.

1743 1 Sur mes lÃ¨vres or READ MY LIPS is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders', people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in'. Director <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON> with and co-writer <PERSON>Tonino Benacquista</PERSON> have created a tense, tight, completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights.<br /><br /><PERSON>Carla</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>) is a plain <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>, mostly deaf, thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak. Enter <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON>) a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s assistant. There is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting: <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> had hoped for a well-groomed, genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> is a coarse, unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk. Their concepts change rather quickly when <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> salvages <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> discovers <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed. So this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s safety and freedom. The relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways.<br /><br /><PERSON>Devos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cassel</PERSON> deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. Once again <PERSON>Alexandre Desplat</PERSON> has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer <PERSON>Mathieu Vadepied</PERSON> finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the Hitchcockian sense of suspense. Director <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments. This is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the French film noir genre. Recommended. <PERSON>Grady Harp</PERSON>
1744 0 First of all, I was expecting "Caged Heat" to be along the same lines as "<LOCATION>Ilsa</LOCATION>, The Wicked Warden". Boy, was I wrong! In no way is this film 70s exploitation, "chix in chains", or "women in prison". Sure, the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison, who wear street clothes btw (quite comical), but NOTHING happens.<br /><br />There aren't strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape, and no inmates make out. There are 2 shower scenes, that I suspect is just recycled footage, but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, unsympathetic, and flat characters, a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to "free" their fellow inmates??!!<br /><br />PUH-LEASE, the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset...as opposed to letting this mess continue!<br /><br />I feel scammed.
1745 1 <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. She is also deaf.<br /><br />Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company. Help arrives in the form of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment.<br /><br />An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. When <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s criminality by having him steal the contract back. The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price. <br /><br /><PERSON>Paul</PERSON> is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan which utilises <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. It's now <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s turn to enter a frightening new world.<br /><br />The fourth feature from director <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>, 'READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird. <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>, who plays <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>, has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame. <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.<br /><br />Like many French films, 'READ MY LIPS' appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.<br /><br />It was the French 'New Wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and I've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.
1746 0 An executive, very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life, meets a boy with down syndrome, escaped from a residence . Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life... With this argument, the somehow Amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, I didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, <PERSON>Daniel Auteil</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pasqal Duquenne</PERSON>, was very good, I decided to go on watching the movie. The French cinema, in general, has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life, opposed to the more stereotyped American cinema. But, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from heaven as <PERSON>Michael Landon</PERSON>... Really nasty, in my humble opinion.
1747 1 I watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it. I loved it. A very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex-con, and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried. <br /><br />A much, much better film than the same director's De battre mon coeur s'est arretÃ©, which was boring and unbelievable.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from conventionally beautiful, but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it. Superb. I wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is. I've seen a bit of <PERSON>Gilles</PERSON>' Wife and a bit of The Moustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and I've seen all of De battre mon coeur s'est arretÃ©, and that certainly is rubbish. She seems to have a few coming up, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
1748 0 Long, boring, blasphemous. Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll.
1749 1 This movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters. I popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact. Toward the end I couldn't decide which I wanted more: Our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion. RML could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty. I'm nitpicking though. After a series of <ORGANIZATION>Netflix</ORGANIZATION>, Blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making.
1750 0 When I sat down to watch this film I actually expected quite a bit, as the plot takes on quite complex issues. Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. Still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.<br /><br />However, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. The film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. This has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. By this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.<br /><br />Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when "the ball drops". This way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clichÃ© that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending. Nothing is left out in the <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> like ending. So even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution. Personally I was close to shouting "finish already!!" at the screen.<br /><br />There were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. So did their parents and other bi-characters. However the handsome Irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. He didn't even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.<br /><br />I give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. The script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. Had the let-downs not been this disappointing, I'd easily give the film a 7 or 8. If you enjoyed this film, I'd recommend the film "East is East", which I think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.
1751 1 Well, what can I say having just watched this fantastic film, when my nerves are still jangling! <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON> the director must be making quite a name for himself in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and rightly so. <PERSON>Vince Cassel</PERSON> is no <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON> and <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON> is no <PERSON>Penelope Cruz</PERSON> either, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection, the director, the actors, right down to the cameraman, and everything seems so real, no stupid gun play, the fighting when it happens is so credible, the expressions, the emotions, it is almost as you are there as a spectator. Do yourself a favour, get the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the lights low, take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
1752 0 Up until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly <PERSON>Jackie Chan</PERSON>'s worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of <PERSON>Chan</PERSON>'s career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of "comedy" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless "football" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - watch to find out what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies. (**)
1753 1 A super, unusual film from <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON>, Read My Lips is a pulpy, lonely- hearts thriller. It's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON> and features a marvellously contained performance from <PERSON>Emanuelle Devos</PERSON>. <PERSON>Devos</PERSON> is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that <PERSON>KArin Viard</PERSON> pops up for <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Jeunet</PERSON>: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.<br /><br />This is almost the definition of her role as <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness. Yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in <PERSON>Cassel</PERSON>'s ex-con <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>. Each exploits the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement. Devos/Audiard manage <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.<br /><br />In this film (2001) <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> is already clearly in control of his handling on tension, action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - A Prophet - of nine years later. 7/10
1754 0 I was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic "Private Lessons" which portrays the dream of any male teenager.<br /><br />"Private Lessons II" has NOTHING to do with the title I mention. It's just a regular soft-core <ORGANIZATION>Cinemax</ORGANIZATION> flick that won't make a change in your life. There's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it. I watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core flick.<br /><br />The women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable.
1755 1 <PERSON>Jean-Jacques</PERSON>' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>; at any rate, it's quite romantic.
1756 0 I can only believe that <PERSON>Garson Kanin</PERSON> must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as "<PERSON>Adam</PERSON>'s Rib" and "<PERSON>Pat And Mike</PERSON>" with his wife <PERSON>Ruth Gordon</PERSON> and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome, sad drivel as "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut", and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clichÃ©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful <PERSON>Brenda Vaccaro</PERSON> are defeated. The script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which <PERSON>Janssen</PERSON>'s character tests Drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. An ugly sequence, but sadly one which could easily play in a film today. "Ethnic" jokes are now totally verboten, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
1757 1 Interesting characters, lots of tension. As close to black and white without being black and white. I was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, near deaf secretary, was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues, rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist, and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away. I'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks. In this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with, or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. Too bad, the film could have been great.
1758 0 Casting bone to pick: <PERSON>David Jannsen</PERSON> was 38 playing the father of <PERSON>Robert Drivas</PERSON>, who was then, 31 (yeah, I realize he's supposed to be just out of college, but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he's probably 24-25 in the script--- that still puts <PERSON>Jannsen</PERSON> in parenting classes in Junior High). I assume the <ORGANIZATION>AMA</ORGANIZATION> wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 Year in Medicine. This movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of <LOCATION>Sin City</LOCATION>, circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking, the weird hair (<PERSON>Drivas</PERSON> has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well-groomed hip Cousin It) and trendy fashions that went along with it. If anyone remembers, <LOCATION>LV</LOCATION> wasn't exactly <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>... the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days. Drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous; his dad thinks he might be gay (in a sad irony, <PERSON>Drivas</PERSON> himself died of AIDS at 47) and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue (ahem, as if one may call 7 years a gap). <PERSON>Sonny</PERSON> boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino (<PERSON>Caesar</PERSON>'s Palace!), and plies him with girls (including the horny-for-money <PERSON>Edy Williams</PERSON>). Interestingly enough, the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay--- unusual for the time and a cute <PERSON>Brenda Vaccarro</PERSON> is nearby to swoon platonically over him. What nudity there is is awfully lame--- just what was needed to pull the audience in for an 'R' rating in the early days of the <ORGANIZATION>MPAA</ORGANIZATION> rating system (which then was G-M-R[16]- and X). The editing is HORRIBLE and there's stupid-silly overdubs by The <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> (a late 60's neo-avante-garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years). <PERSON>Don Rickles</PERSON> is on board as a blackjack dealer... seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later. Not to give anything away, but they would've dealt with Mr. <PERSON>Rickles</PERSON>' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then. A curiosity at best, far from <PERSON>Joshua Logan</PERSON>'s usual caliber of work. Dos/Dias. Now go watch CASINO again...
1759 1 After erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times, there is a feeling that I can now conquer this review for the complex French drama, "Read My Lips". Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>'s subtle, yet inspirational love story. Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film, and while the "loves" overpowered, it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind. "Read My Lips" is a drama. To be more precise, is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work. Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items Â– but it is moreÂ…much, much more. As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>' portrayal of this fragile woman named <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty. <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid, causing an immediate unrest, not only from the characters within the film, but to those watching. Without sound, the world is left open to any possibility, and that is frightening.<br /><br />As we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life, we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (played exquisitely by <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON>), a slicked-back hair, mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison, homeless, jobless, and forced by his parole officer to get a job. This is how <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> meet. There is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction. The one where we think she loves him, but he is dark (and here is where it gets even more fun) Â– and where we think he loves her, but she is dark. The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown. Who, as viewers, are we to feel the most sympathy for? <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> sleeps in the office, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> helps him; <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> looses a contract to a rival co-worker, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> helps her; <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>. The continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair, waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave. It never does. Audiard cannot just allow this story to take place, he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next. Even our rock, our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing Â– a subplot to this film that at first angered me, but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film. Yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters. <PERSON>Devos</PERSON>' solemn and homely look is breathtaking, as she changes her image for <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>; the truth of her beauty is discovered. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, the wildcard in the film, continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame. Then, just as we assume one, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> takes on one last shape.<br /><br /><PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters. <PERSON>Cassel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Devos</PERSON> could just play cards the entire time and I would still be sitting at the end of my chair. The story, probably the weakest part of this film, is at first random. The interwoven stories seem unconnected at first, but <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> lets them connect bit by bit. Again, the entire parole officer segment was tangent, but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means. Not attempting to sound vague, but this complex (yet utterly simple) story is difficult to explain. There is plenty happening, but it is up to you to connect the pieces. A favorite scene is when <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is attempting to discover where some money is being held. That use of sound and scene was brilliant. It was tense, it was dramatic, and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes.<br /><br />Overall, I initially though this was a mediocre French film that I could easily forget about when it was over Â– I was proved wrong. "Read My Lips" opens the floor for discussion, not just with the characters, but the situations. One will find themselves rooting for <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> in one scene, and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> in the next. When a discovery is made in <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s apartment by <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>, I found myself deeply angry. <PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development, and what he was lacking in plot Â– the actors were able to carry. I can easily suggest this film to anyone, but be prepared; this isn't a one time viewing film. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****
1760 0 <PERSON>Garson Kanin</PERSON> wrote and directed this look at "modern day" <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! <PERSON>David Janssen</PERSON> is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (<PERSON>Robert Drivas</PERSON>, who looks disconcertingly like an older <PERSON>Jason Bateman</PERSON>). <PERSON>Janssen</PERSON> approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from <PERSON>Janssen</PERSON>, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out <PERSON>Don Rickles</PERSON> and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. <PERSON>Brenda Vaccaro</PERSON> is cute as a self-conscious secretary and <PERSON>Edy Willaims</PERSON> has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, "Where It's At" doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** from ****
1761 1 Probably the best film of the year for me. This small French film centers on put upon office secretary <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>) who spends her days doing other men's jobs, uncredited, and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as, being partially deaf, she reads lips. A change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON>) as her assistant. The relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film. Mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> becomes attracted to <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve <PERSON>Carlas</PERSON>' skill of reading lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the whole film, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing bond between <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>. I cannot remember when I have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. <PERSON>Emmanuell Devos</PERSON> gives a brilliant performance (she won the French <PERSON>Cesar</PERSON> for best actress). You never feel like you are watching a piece of acting, this really is <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>. The chameleon like <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON> is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive. I loved this film because of these two people, and both times when I had finished watching it I wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again.
1762 0 Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series, Four For <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> is not only awful, but really awful. So awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash.<br /><br /><PERSON>Nick</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> and <PERSON>Luis</PERSON> is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> works as a waitress and <PERSON>Luis</PERSON>, an artist. <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> indirectly causes <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> to lose her job as an waitress. <PERSON>Luis</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> had an affair at the back of <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nick</PERSON>. <PERSON>Luis</PERSON> cheated on <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> by lying to her that he would be flying off to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is, he is flying off to <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> for an adultery holiday. <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> kidnapped <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> and dragged her 2 kids along to <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> for confrontation. The trip to <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> ends up both <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> falling for one another.<br /><br />The presentation of the journey from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> between <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> marks the failure of the comedy. It not only look senseless, but also draggy. In the film, <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail. It is either the strangers around him who acts like morons, or they are just simply dumb.<br /><br />The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem.<br /><br />It fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> fails to pull up the reputation of the film.
1763 1 "Read My Lips" tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (<PERSON>Devos</PERSON>) and her workplace trainee, a crude excon (<PERSON>Casel</PERSON>). As the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. Good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B+)
1764 0 There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, <PERSON>Nick Cage</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON> in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. Judge <PERSON>Reinhold</PERSON> as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.
1765 1 I picked this one up on a whim from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. Lots of tight, expressionistic camera work, an equally tight script, and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather the true aficionado of cinema. If <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> ever does get its grimy hands on it, I'm sure it will ruin it. A choice treat all the way around. Other posters here have more than amply sung its praises, so I needn't bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice, and mine, and don't miss this gem. Call it what you like; I call it two hours of entertainment well-spent. Read my lips: don't miss it.
1766 0 The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director <PERSON>Mira Nair</PERSON> took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has descended en masse into the cesspool.
1767 1 I settled back to watch "Read My Lips," a plate of Freedom Fries before me. The food was quickly forgotten as I became engrossed by director and co-writer <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>'s original and superb thriller.<br /><br /><PERSON>Carla</PERSON> (<PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON>) is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects. She actually has some significant responsibilities that don't often fall to secretaries and she's capable and ambitious. And thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her.<br /><br />Work piling up faster than she can handle it, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is told to hire a secretary. Enter ex-con and general layabout <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> (<PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON>). He lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require. After an initial serious misunderstanding by <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> as to <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s interest in him, the two become allies. A quirky friendship starts. In a stunt that would have made a real <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> a major contender on "The Apprentice," she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s connivance. Exit the rival.<br /><br /><PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. With it she hears almost normally. She turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She's also very lonely. A heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she's truly beautiful. She hasn't a boyfriend. She babysits so a friend can have a liaison (it IS a French movie) Worse and humiliatingly, she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s bed. Not nice.<br /><br />As <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> get to know each other better, the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges. There's a side story, by the way, of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending.<br /><br />"Read My Lips?" Ingenious <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> recognizes that <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be.<br /><br />From there a caper develops. Enough said.<br /><br /><PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> are a true criminal oddball couple. She wants love but will also accept money. He wants her, sort of, but business must come before possible erotic satiation. Together <PERSON>Cassel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Devos</PERSON> are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly.<br /><br />Rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you'll go for "Read My Lips." And you may well want to watch it several times: I do.<br /><br />9/10
1768 0 <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, I Love You, or rather should-be-titled <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, I Love Looking At Your People In Sometimes Love, is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation. Case in point, look at two of the segments in the film, one where <PERSON>Ethan Hawke</PERSON> lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk, and another with <ORGANIZATION>Orlando Bloom</ORGANIZATION> trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two <PERSON>Dostoyevsky</PERSON> books. While the latter isn't a great story by any stretch, it's at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, as the composer tries to score, gets <PERSON>Dostoyevky</PERSON> dumped in his lap, and in the end gets some help (and maybe something more) from a girl he's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director. The <PERSON>Ethan Hawke</PERSON> scene, however, is like nothing, and feels like it, like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in (or, for that matter, <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> with a combo of Before Sunrise and Reality Bites).<br /><br />What's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible 'stories' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another (i.e. bits involving <PERSON>Bradley Cooper</PERSON>, <PERSON>Drea DeMatteo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hayden Christensen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andy Garcia</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Caan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Natalie Portman</PERSON>, etc). It's not even so much that the film- set practically always in *<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>* and not the <LOCATION>New York of Queens</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION> or the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> (not even, say, <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Washington Heights</LOCATION>)- lacks a good deal of diversity, since there is some. It's the lack of imagination that one found in spades, for better or worse, in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> J'taime. It's mostly got little to do with <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, except for passing references, and at its worst (the <PERSON>Julie Christie/Shia</PERSON> LaBeouf segment) it's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling.<br /><br />So, basically, wait for TV, and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in, that is, for three scenes: the aforementioned Bloom/Christina <PERSON>Ricci</PERSON> segment which is charming; the <PERSON>Brett Ratner</PERSON> directed segment (yes, X-Men 3 <PERSON>Brett Ratner</PERSON>) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and <PERSON>Eli Wallach</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cloris Leachman</PERSON> as an adorable quite old couple walking along in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> on their 67th wedding anniversary. Everything else can be missed, even <PERSON>Natalie Portman</PERSON>'s directorial debut, and the return of a Hughes brother (only one, <PERSON>Allan</PERSON>) to the screen. A mixed bag is putting it lightly: it's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left.
1769 1 If you're a fan of film noir and think they don't make 'em like they used to, here is your answer -they just don't make 'em in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> anymore. We must turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>, featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON>.<br /><br />The basic plot could have been written in the 40's: dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing, manipulate each other to meet their own ends, develop complex love/hate relationship, cook up criminal scheme involving heist, double crosses, close calls and lots of money. All action takes place in depressing, seedy and/or poorly lit locations. <br /><br /><PERSON>Audiard</PERSON> has fashioned some modern twists, of course. The femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature. Add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film, but make no mistake - this is old school film noir. It's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films I've seen all year.
1770 0 An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised. There's a lot of talent involved here. A great many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had.<br /><br />First of all, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them clash with the others. <br /><br />Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped to me. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather, they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in. <br /><br />Last but not least, I did not feel New-York and its inhabitants were properly portrayed.<br /><br />What you're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
1771 1 I must admit that I had my doubts about this movie before I was going to watch it. The main reason for that is because it was compared to a <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> movie. I've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> or that could have been made by the 'Master of Suspense' himself, but so far I haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time. In my opinion <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some (cheap) thrillers, but on the other hand I must admit that I was intrigued by it because this is a European movie. Normally it's the big <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> studios who like to abuse <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>'s name if that can raise their income. But this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic European countries ever and I'm sure that most French would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an Englishman. That's why I decided to give this movie a try and I must say that I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />"Sur mes lÃ¨vres" or "Read my Lips" as it is called in English, tells the story of a young secretary named <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>. She is a hardworking and loyal employee, but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues. That has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency, which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company. But when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her, all this is about to change. <PERSON>Paul Angeli</PERSON> is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict. The man is a thief, but <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> gives him a chance and covers for him when needed. She hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like, but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life...<br /><br />Since I still believe that the name <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - I will not make any comparisons between <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>'s directing. Fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie. I hadn't heard of him before, but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end. That also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course. I doubt if there is someone in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role, instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband (you know, the typical TV-movie story).<br /><br />Also worth noticing is the acting in this movie. <PERSON>Vincent Cassel</PERSON> is quite famous, but <PERSON>Emmanuelle Devos</PERSON> was a complete mystery to me. There is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles, but they both did an excellent job with their characters, making them feel very believable and realistic. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> the typically helpless woman, but thanks to their performances, you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together.<br /><br />All in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting. Despite the fact that I had my doubts about it, I've soon become one of its greatest admirers. I give this movie an 8/10. Don't hesitate to give it a try.
1772 0 A few years back the same persons who created <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>,J'TAIME., which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7), created this piece of garbage about <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.<br /><br />In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, I Love You (J'taime)created a feeling for <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> & it was made in many parts of beautiful <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.<br /><br />In this current film, I did not recognize <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth.<br /><br /><LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> does have 5 boroughs,I saw no scenes in The <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, or <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> ,There is one scene in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>,(<LOCATION>Brighton Beach</LOCATION>), I saw no scenes in <LOCATION>Times Square</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Greenwich Village</LOCATION>/ No scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres.

1773 1 This was one of the DVD's I recently bought in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to brush up our French before our planned holiday in beautiful <LOCATION>Provence</LOCATION> this year. So far, as well as improving our French we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of French cinema.<br /><br />What a breath of fresh air to the stale, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. What a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. It was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures. <br /><br />The other thing I liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end. Is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naÃ¯ve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display? Will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other.<br /><br />Once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again. I still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office. You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. But if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
1774 0 Following the success of "<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story, it's over in too many cases. And, the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.<br /><br />Sadly, however, while "<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Je T'Aime" was hit or miss (mostly hit), most of "<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, I Love You" was miss. The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet--and often quite terrible. It was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories--and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so. Now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also in the first film) and the crotchety old couple. This is all so sad because I had loved the first film so much--and I really WANTED to love this film. I respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much.<br /><br />By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed how many people were smoking in the film. For a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.<br /><br />Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film. One consists of <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog....and absolutely NOTHING more for almost ten minutes. The other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world--including a very unhappy couple.
1775 1 French film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary, everyday suburban life. This was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of L'Emploi du temps ( Time Out ) , a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job. As is the penchant of French filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places, giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet L'Emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a Swiss mountain retreat ). Running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive French production, <PERSON>Jacques Audiard</PERSON>'s gritty crime caper, Sur mes levres ( Read My Lips ). Actually, to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that. As with the earlier French release, it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them. In a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> construction firm <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>, a shy, diminutive young woman sits at her desk, sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.<br /><br />Obnoxious coworkers use the front of <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s desk to chat and drop off their half-finished Styrofoam cups of coffee. Partially deaf, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome, be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby. When her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> fears she may lose her job. At the employment office <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> lists the specifications she wants for her assistant (preferably male) as if she were at a Personals Agency. He should be 25 years old and clean -cut , with extensive computer and filing skills. When the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> is both shocked and intrigued. They leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery, where <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> interviews her prospective assistant. When she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> initially wants nothing to do with <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, but has a change of heart and hires him on. Although she is basically kind toward her helper, <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> learns quickly and becomes an able worker. <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> helps <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> missed his appointment. During one of their lunch breaks <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> informs <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips. Later, when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> has been working on, a furious <PERSON>Carla</PERSON> asks <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s help in seeking revenge on the man. From here on in Sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years. The screenplay borrows elements from <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>, most notably REAR WINDOW, where <PERSON>Carla</PERSON>'s lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars. There is a teasing, on-again, off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars. That being said, what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> thrillers, although those elements are definitely there, but the pervasive view a of a modern day city (in this case <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy, garish nightlife where sex, drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters. Unlike Hollywood productions, this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street, where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared. It's <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON> with the gloves off.
1776 0 This was a movie i could not wait to see! So i finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. For starters,the movie has so little said about <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings,streets,bridges and cafes.It really doesn't stay focused on the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> magic.Another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.I know that it is a remake,but it is not a french style remake! Anyway,here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies,such as long and messy scenes,no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! The story follows many lives ( too many for my taste) and they somehow seem connected in the end. I feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories. The movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending.So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and i loved the cast !
1777 1 One of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as I had hoped given the glowing reviews. The movie starts out well enough, with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you'd think for this era) and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable (for a kung fu movie, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of <PERSON>Jackie Chan</PERSON>'s Police Story I) cop dramas, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. Unfortunately, in the latter 1/3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which I thought was unnecessary.<br /><br />The action is overall good, featuring a duel between <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> and 1/2 of the <ORGANIZATION>Shaw Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' only 2 stars, <PERSON>Kar-Leung Lau</PERSON> and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays <PERSON>Jet Li</PERSON>'s bad guy. There's only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames. I get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth edits and then there's this. It really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with.<br /><br />That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here won't dissuade you, and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this.
1778 0 I've never been to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, but after seeing "<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Je t'aime" I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I LOVE the city and its boroughs. I kinda expected to be touched by this film, to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away, but, lo and behold, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine. Maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own. Can't you find love in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>?
1779 1 This is one of the best <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. This <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> film has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well. It is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> fans- This is a must see (See also Eastern Condors, <ORGANIZATION>Shanghai Express</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Yuen Biao</PERSON> is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
1780 0 I saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and I was straight up blown away by how bad it was. <br /><br />First off, the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots. There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, say, know the self-involved white people in love? I know it's not the love Crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness but you can't pretend to have a cinematic <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with out these fairly prevalent members of society. Plus, you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that ham-handed Oscar, so where is everyone? <br /><br />Possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs? Me either). This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants. <br /><br />But thank god they finally got powerhouses <PERSON>Hayden Christensen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rachel Bilson</PERSON> back together for that Jumper reunion. And, side note, <PERSON>Uma</PERSON> dodged a bullet; <PERSON>Ethan Hawke</PERSON> looks ravaged. This, of course, is one thing in terms of his looks, but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor, lovely <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> Q.<br /><br />I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire, but it has to be the <PERSON>Anton Yelchin</PERSON>/ <LOCATION>Olivia Thirlby</LOCATION> bit for the sheer lack of taste, which saddens me because I really like those two actors. I don't consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt. <br /><br />A close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former <ORGANIZATION>Disney Channel</ORGANIZATION> star to act against <PERSON>Julie Christie</PERSON>. I don't mean opposite, I mean against. Against is the only explanation. I realize now that the early sequence with <ORGANIZATION>Orlando Bloom</ORGANIZATION> is a relative highlight. HIGHLIGHT. Please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits, which seem to be a nod to the first <ORGANIZATION>New York Real World</ORGANIZATION>. This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real idea of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at all. <br /><br />(The extra star is for the <PERSON>Cloris Leachman</PERSON>/ <PERSON>Eli Wallach</PERSON> sequence, as it is actually quite sweet, but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless, masturbatory torment.)
1781 1 This is one excellent <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON> movie. Actually, this is a great piece of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> action cinema. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in <LOCATION>Macao</LOCATION> looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined. The story is involving and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON> proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business. The action is simply amazing, esp. the fight w/ <PERSON>Lau Kar Leung</PERSON> and the finale. <PERSON>Billy Chow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON> are amazing. A must see for any fan of action.
1782 0 Having loved '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Je T'aime', I highly anticipated this film and I admit I went in with high expectations, but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Although, I was not expecting a re-make of '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>' in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>' was the breakup of the neighborhoods. You got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell. In 'NY', there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who I was watching and what exactly was going on. Also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about the '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>' film was the different takes on love. It wasn't all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman yearning for love etc., it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. 'NY' seemed to only go for an edgy, over-the-top sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts (the older couple having spent a lifetime together, <PERSON>Julie Christie</PERSON>'s short), but overall the'NY' film didn't evoke any emotion for me. I didn't connect with any of the characters like I did with '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>'. I remember watching '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder... it just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the 'NY' film.<br /><br />Maybe if I had gone into it without having '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a self-titled re-take of '<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Je T'aime' I was sorely disappointed.
1783 1 What can I add that the previous comments haven't already said. This is a great film and the Light Sabre duel Star Wars tribute has to be seen to be believed!! There are moments of genius throughout this movie, if you can, SEE IT NOW! Thanks again to <PERSON>Rick Baker</PERSON> who gave me this movie many years ago!
1784 0 (I'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin.) My dissatisfaction is split: 30% tone-deafness, 70% lackluster writing.<br /><br />The 30%: I agree with the first commenter's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. I was surprised how, this film, at best, woefully shortchanges the real NYC by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it's inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl (this is coming from someone who likes Gossip Girl). A few minority characters are written into the stories, but they are included by obligation, while we can see the gears under the film so clearly, striving to "be diverse" but falling ever-so-short.<br /><br />The 70% is why everything falls short. All characters, white plus a few token minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts of people concepts. Worse, their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what I'd say is a "gag": we get a basic conceit, then some punchline intended to be a clever twist. But even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say, "Okay, that was a surprise"...the stories are still not that interesting, because they, too, are shallow. When you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending, you're writing jokes.<br /><br />Spoilers below...<br /><br />The movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories. That's fine. But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other. Words exchange, thoughts are projected through voice-over, but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another.<br /><br />Meaning, there is no seduction (in the broad sense), no tension, and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other. The only story involving a superficial "seduction" is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy (<PERSON>Ethan Hawke</PERSON>) gets outwitted by the girl he's hitting on, who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker. Sure, his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we'd be if we were next to them, but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of "A then B". So it unfolds, if something like a postcard could "unfold", with all the other tales as well: A then B--That's It, the only point being that these happen to occur "on set" in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. By the way, the only <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> we see is the <LOCATION>Coney Island</LOCATION> sketch; the only <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the <LOCATION>West Village</LOCATION>.<br /><br />It's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. _<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, I Love You_, however, deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title. We expect to see the real <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and real New Yorkers, but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic, its characters flown in from The O.C., plus a few others to make it SEEM as if we are paying attention to diversity. But when we look closer at who those characters are, the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent.<br /><br />For example, the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park, who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny (male nanny) when in fact he's the father. Notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic-construction point of view (it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend/stepfather are strutting the girl away), it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl's father is Latino ALSO must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, the dad can't be just some guy from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>? Now that he's obviously hot, is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle-to-upper-class white woman? Are we that naive as to require such? As if a Mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable.<br /><br />It's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. But in every conceivable set-up and plot twist, the direction taken screams status quo, appeals to safety. All these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we were forced to keep the single-dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them, at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION> being leered at by a scraggly old white guy? How 'bout an Asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead. Again, I'm not saying the entire conceit has to be changed. It's just that every. damn. story premise. is so hackneyed--and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, outside the trite. The real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading.<br /><br />I will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack, the good pacing of the movie (even if what was being paced was, well, dredge), and the general feel of many of the scenes. The movie was just fine to sit through, and I wouldn't dissuade anyone from doing so. However, it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrased) "That's what I love about <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>: everyone's from a different place." Well, you wouldn't know it from watching this one.
1785 1 sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos.<br /><br />this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat. sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in.<br /><br />some great and touching moments in the film, lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted.<br /><br />the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the best end fights I've seen. sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow.
1786 0 When I bought this DVD I though: "It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standardsÂ… let's give it a chanceÂ…" I was TOTALLY WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring, and leads nowhereÂ… It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one or another directionÂ… The production is also bad! The sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80'sÂ… The acting should have been better tooÂ… Well, to sum up, it's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years! Bad argument, bad acting, bad productionÂ… I had no high hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I've ever imagined! Just forget about it!
1787 1 <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON>'s 1989 film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> film ever has. It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry.<br /><br /><PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Max Mok Siu Chung</PERSON> play two pedicab drivers who live in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> in the middle part of the last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> is interested in local baker girl <PERSON>Ping</PERSON> (<PERSON>Nina Li Chi</PERSON>) while <PERSON>Max</PERSON> one day meets a mysterious and beautiful <PERSON>Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying</PERSON> he falls madly in love with. Many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created. As well as some nice drama.<br /><br />The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and "humor" as in <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON>'s otherwise great Eastern Condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar <LOCATION>HK</LOCATION> cinema faces and directors in small roles like <PERSON>Corey Yuen Kwai</PERSON> (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul 1 and 2, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and <PERSON>Fong Sai Yuk</PERSON> 1 and 2), the masterful composer <PERSON>Lowell Lo Koon-Ting</PERSON> (<PERSON>John Woo</PERSON>'s The Killer and <PERSON>Ringo Lam</PERSON>'s School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included!), the <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON>Liu Chia Liang</PERSON> (whom with <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> has a furious fight with sticks), <PERSON>Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting</PERSON> (the director of dark HK noir classic On the Run from 1988), the late great <PERSON>Lam Ching Ying</PERSON> (best known for his friendly face in various <LOCATION>HK</LOCATION> vampire horror/kung fu/comedies) to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other <LOCATION>HK</LOCATION> production.<br /><br />The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between <PERSON>Max Mok</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fennie Yuen</PERSON> and one crisis they confront thanks to <PERSON>Lowell Lo</PERSON>'s character. They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past or what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner. Also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. Still I think what <PERSON>Fennie</PERSON> says to <PERSON>Max</PERSON> (about the future "bad cooking") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately.<br /><br />But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. Which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. The fight scenes include traditional kung fu, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene I've seen in any film ever, <PERSON>Jackie Chan</PERSON>'s Drunken Master II (1994), they really are that great! There are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched. Simply amazing and again something ONLY <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> cinema can deliver. Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. Still the film makers seem not to "accept" the violence of the film as <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> is, like the late <PERSON>Bruce Lee</PERSON>, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious or shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment.<br /><br />The film has also some very witty bits of humor that I'm not sure everyone in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> (for example) would understand or like at all. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created out of <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON>'s passion for <PERSON>Ping</PERSON>. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course.<br /><br />Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> action films that I have ever seen and easily among <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON>'s greatest achievements. If the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. 8/10
1788 0 Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before going I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty nice rate...<br /><br />After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did this), but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening.<br /><br />I did not like at all, the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogs, nothing lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: plenty of <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> and Organics advertising on the movie. Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! All of this would be bearable if the plot, characters, romances, anything was good, but was bad, really bad! A "don't know how to do" sex-in-the-city.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.
1789 1 This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favourite <PERSON>Sammo Hung</PERSON> films. The Fat Dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "Condors", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor. He is, in fact, at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story also. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes.<br /><br />The opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON>'s pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. The fast and furious stick fight between <PERSON>Sammo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lau Kar Leung</PERSON> is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its type. The film's violence escalates slowly until, finally, when the climactic showdown comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a <LOCATION>Sammo</LOCATION> production. The director/actor's assault on <PERSON>Billy Chow</PERSON> and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.<br /><br />Terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made.<br /><br />Great score, too.
1790 0 but "Cinderella" gets my vote, not only for the worst of <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s princess movies, but for the worst movie the company made during <PERSON>Walt</PERSON>'s lifetime. The music is genuinely pretty, and the story deserves to be called "classic." What fails in this movie are the characters, particularly the title character, who could only be called "the heroine" in the loosest sense of the term.<br /><br />After a brief prologue, the audience is introduced to Cinderella. She is waking up in the morning and singing "A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes." This establishes her as an idealist (and thus deserving of our sympathy). Unfortunately, the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about. Freedom from her servant role? The respect of her step-family? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds? In one song (cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD) <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON> relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently. You go girlfriend! In short, <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON> is a very bland character. She passively accepts her step-family's abuse, escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief. She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family. For this, she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear, a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except, of course, <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON>. Can anyone see <PERSON>Belle</PERSON> or Jasmine being such a doormat? If <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON> is dull, her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless. The Prince in <LOCATION>Cinderella</LOCATION> gets no dialog and almost no screen time. We are given no indication if he is a good man, if he respects <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON> or anything. All we know is 1) he is a prince and 2) he dances well. Heck, even the prince from "Snow White" got to sing a romantic song at least. Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting, it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot, weakening her already tenuous appeal.<br /><br />Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were, the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie's comic relief, <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON>'s friends, the mice. Granted, these characters are amusing. Even so, when the comic relief steals the show from the principals, well, let's just say your story has some problems.<br /><br /><PERSON>Dinsey</PERSON> loves to proclaim all its animated features as "masterpieces." While many of them are, there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way. <PERSON>Cinderella</PERSON> is a prime example of this fact.
1791 1 I have seen this movie. This movie is the best according today's need. Dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays. In stating this problem this movie is the best. In this movie, the Indian values are stated very well. Today's youth must understand this problem. There is less population of girls. And due to this problem of dowry , the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there is no girl child, is not far away.So, keep in mind this statement ,today's youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriages.We have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken.And if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society. This is the major change in the society.
1792 0 This film is awful. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (<PERSON>Winona Ryder</PERSON> wannabe <PERSON>Tara Frederick</PERSON>) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director <PERSON>Paul Shapiro</PERSON> has mainly worked in TV, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.
1793 1 Once in a while, you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained. Vivah is just that Â– maybe more. After watching DDLJ, <PERSON>Saajan</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Lamhey</PERSON>, I really thought that Bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that - EVER. Boy was I wrong! I went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new "DON" (just so I can compare The Great AB with ShahRukh Â– although the decision is already made in my mind). After debating whether I should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie I decided to watch it realizing I had nothing else to do. When I saw the rating of U instead of an A, I was happy that at least it is something where I don't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> B actress. For the first 5 minutes or so I thought I would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting. After all everyone who has seen <PERSON>Shahid Kapor</PERSON> know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor. Boy Â– was I wrong about this movie. This movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go. It was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society. I liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept (of arranged marriage), but also that he did it with a conviction (that it is the right thing to do). I have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good. I felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever, it was still very very good. The good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the I watched that movie a second time. The other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies. These songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition. Just like <PERSON>Ajay Devgan</PERSON> went from being a joke to a great actor (after Company), and <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> found his groove after "Hum Aapkey Hain Kaun"; this movie will help <PERSON>Shahid Kappor</PERSON> jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in Bollywood. This is the first movie of his in which I like him and his role. He acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid. Yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw ShahRukh in DDLJ (even though he is shown to be an Indian in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> Â– both countries not big on Basketball by the way), he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values. <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>, for the first time came across as someone to be remembered. In all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her. No one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie. Some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting. Although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one. I think this movie will and should do wonders for her. Move over <PERSON>Rani Â</PERSON>– there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you. She is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence. Oh having almost 0% body fat does not hurt either (yes people I will challenge you find even 0.1% fat on her and unlike so many others like <PERSON>Sonali</PERSON> she can actually act too). I thought I will never be enamored by anyone's beauty after <PERSON>Madhuri</PERSON> and early <PERSON>Kajol</PERSON>, but she completely changed that. <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job (although I was waiting for <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> to turn into a girl like <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> did every time he uttered "Hum aapkey Hain Kaun"). When I finished watching this movie, it left me so emotionally drained that I decided to watch this movie again (right away). Yes right away. I have never ever done that. Not even with DDLJ, but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again. I will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so I can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with. I miss those times where families sat down and had fun. When parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in. I know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down don't we all want it to happen. The families, thee tradition, the love and respect. This is what this movie will remind all of us of. I can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy. I am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 I doubt that you will be one of them.
1794 0 Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", <PERSON>Steve Gordon</PERSON> had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for <PERSON>Henry Winkler</PERSON>, then TV's "The Fonz". A 1950s college thespian (and all-around jerk) woos a co-ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling, eventually becoming a "Gorgeous George"-like celebrity. Turning likable <PERSON>Winkler</PERSON> into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and mean, staged rather sloppily by director <PERSON>Carl Reiner</PERSON>. Particularly crude is a wincing bit involving HervÃ© <PERSON>Villechaize</PERSON> (of "Fantasy Island") putting the moves on <PERSON>Polly Holliday</PERSON> (<PERSON>Flo</PERSON> from "Alice"). As <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>'s beloved, <PERSON>Kim Darby</PERSON> looks a little out of her element--particularly when surrounded by all these TV hams--rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential. *1/2 from ****
1795 1 What can i say, i have grown up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, <ORGANIZATION>Hum Aapke Hain Koun</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Maine Pyar Kiya</PERSON>. Soraj have always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times Soraj creates something thats hard to find. Love and joint family that loving and great. Vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage. <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> has done fine work. <PERSON>Anupamji</PERSON> as always brilliant. <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> quit different even though I felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role. We've seen her in <LOCATION>Ishk Vishk</LOCATION> and Ab ke baras, and Main ho on Na. So quit different role that she isn't in to. She is been excellent in Main ho on Na and ishk vishk but may be she could've put little more in the role. Anyways great going work by <PERSON>Barjatya</PERSON>. This movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot. Sweet film of the year. Great music and lyrics. I am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original. <PERSON>Soraj</PERSON>'s movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him. Great work by all the cast the crew and everybody. Lovely family film to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and love ones. I give it 10 out of 10.
1796 0 <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>'s "Delirious" is completely and totally rude, crude, crass and lude. This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling, trashy piece of stand-up. <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON> goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over. He does manage to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes.<br /><br />Forget it! Unless you happen to enjoy <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON>'s foul style. I don't think I will bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I much prefer <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> in the confines of a movie script.<br /><br />Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
1797 1 One would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies, too). The actors, the beautiful settings, locations, and surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of <PERSON>Udit Narayan</PERSON>, my favorite) -- everything was just lovely. The human (imperfect) element was also woven in, to create some drama and drive the plot, as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution. <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON> is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances -- ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love -- as one of the best films out there, Hindi or otherwise!
1798 0 On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball (1998): "This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk. Unfortunately, I was sober when I saw this movie."<br /><br />So quoted the late <PERSON>Gene Siskel</PERSON> for this lame-brained, supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior "There's Something About Mary" in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998. "Mary" was a gross-out fest, but in addition to the many gags, it had a lot of heart, which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.<br /><br />"BASEketball" tried to outdo <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of "<LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Trey Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matt Stone</PERSON>, who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera, the only member of ZAZ <PERSON>David Zucker</PERSON> helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck, and the other two <PERSON>Jim Abrahams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Zucker</PERSON> clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture, a small bit by now 90 years young <PERSON>Ernest Borgnine</PERSON>, wasting his precious time in his distinguished career, dying on a hotdog and singing "I'm Too Sexy" as he videotapes his will, <PERSON>Jenny McCarthy</PERSON>, who has little screen time as <PERSON>Borgnine</PERSON>'s not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter, a bigger female part by <PERSON>Yasmine Bleeth</PERSON> as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters, and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey, <PERSON>Robert Vaughn</PERSON> as a corrupt archrival, and pointless cameos by "Airplane!" alumni <PERSON>Kareem Abdul Jabaar</PERSON> and the late <PERSON>Robert Stack</PERSON> who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate "Airplane!" humor and mixing it up with the crudity of "<LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION>," but failing in every way.<br /><br />To make this long 100-minute movie short, "BASEketball," a real game invented by <PERSON>David Zucker</PERSON> and his friends in his hometown of <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>, is about two lazy losers (<PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of one's house. After <PERSON>Borgnine</PERSON> dies, he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team, the <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Beers</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone. Sure enough, the game goes national, and archrivals <PERSON>Vaughn</PERSON> and <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> want to take away ownership of the <ORGANIZATION>Beers</ORGANIZATION> team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men, particularly <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>, and one poor, sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them. Those are the characters, not strongly developed.<br /><br />Now witless gags ensue. Blood, electroshock hair, egg-throwing and screaming are among them. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital, but he pulls through the liver transplant. <PERSON>Borgnine</PERSON> sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON>, who seemed to get over <PERSON>Borgnine</PERSON>'s death by choking on a frank right away, quickly massages <PERSON>Vaughn</PERSON> in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And <PERSON>David Zucker</PERSON> forces the parodies of "Riverdance" and "Titanic." Parody forcing is nothing new to <ORGANIZATION>ZAZ</ORGANIZATION>, post "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun" series.<br /><br />And like <PERSON>Siskel</PERSON>, I was sober as well, but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers, but will they remain alert and awake, or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out, then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!
1799 1 I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. Since my younger brother has recently got married, we could connect with the goings-on. The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites, hence adding to the connection with movie. The dialogues are much better than those in the "Umrao Jaan Ada" - a supposedly dialogue based movie. The background music is augmenting the "soft focus" of the movie. It somehow remind me of VV <PERSON>Chopra</PERSON>'s "Kareeb", in which neha and to some extent <PERSON>Bobby</PERSON> did full justice to the character. Same here, in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. The Supporting cast are too good. I rate the actress playing the role of <PERSON>Bhabhi</PERSON> in the front league. The situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. Songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. However, though I respect <PERSON>Ravindra Jain</PERSON> for his body of work from movies to <ORGANIZATION>Ramayana</ORGANIZATION>, I missed <PERSON>Ram Laxman</PERSON> badly.<br /><br />It had no double entendres(<PERSON>Sivan</PERSON> category), no bikinis, no intrigue, and no nonsense. You would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged. I want to express on candid thing here that though <ORGANIZATION>Suraj</ORGANIZATION> proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals, his approach is totally individualistic. The movie is only about <ORGANIZATION>Prem & Poonam</ORGANIZATION>, rest of the characters are incidental. Art immitating life? The "peripheral characters" are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair. <br /><br />Coming back, Everything was almost great. Except, for the drama part. The situation of tragedy was artificially created. The outcome, the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. That is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. But, a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film'. But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came. The preaching by <PERSON>Mohnish Bahal</PERSON> and later by <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON> on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. May be this will help the movie a tax-free status. But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was.<br /><br />There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended? 2 Has the movie ended?
1800 0 ...and not in a good way. BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way. It is offensive to all the senses. This doesn't necessarily bother me, I've seen plenty of bad movies, really bad movies before and will see them again. BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars <PERSON>Trey Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matt Stone</PERSON> in a film they didn't write. Any respect I had for <PERSON>David Zucker</PERSON> has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes. "Airplane" was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.<br /><br />I have so much respect for <PERSON>Trey Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matt Stone</PERSON>. These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today. Their pictures and <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION> episodes are as relevant as they are funny. Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them. It's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity. I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons. It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone have essentially whored themselves out. The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.<br /><br /><PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone have never been great actors. They've been serviceable in their films. I can't really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball, other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film. Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way. It's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way. I am reminded of the <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION> episode "How to Eat with your Butt" where <PERSON>Cartman</PERSON> sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture. Really it's sad.<br /><br />And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There isn't any indication that <PERSON>Zucker</PERSON> let them improv scenes either. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> especially if he were allowed to take <ORGANIZATION>Zuckers</ORGANIZATION> script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Don't rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around
1801 1 This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south Asian culture alive. <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> acted extremely well in this, also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies. This is a must see movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This movie is also from the makers of Hum Saath <PERSON>Saath Hain</PERSON> and Hum Apke Hain <PERSON>Kon</PERSON>. This movie is their best right now... the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction. This movie is must see... recommended to everyone!!
1802 0 <PERSON>Sophia Loren</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Aida</PERSON>, in one of the worst films of all time. She can't lipsync. In terms of production values, the film is so bad, that at one point, while <PERSON>Loren</PERSON> is mouthing "O <PERSON>Patria Mia</PERSON>," she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support, and the canvas set billows and shakes.
1803 1 Well... Vivah is quite a good, but typical <PERSON>Sooraj Barjatya</PERSON>'s movie. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The movie is more than good, but not extremely good.<br /><br />The big plus point of the movie is direction, music and <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>'s acting (especially the last scene). The movie starts with a common factor of Indian movie--- A girl being disliked by her step-mother. Story is the movie is a bit common, but it is good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster.<br /><br />Minus point is common story of Bollywood movie. Overall I would say it is two times must watch movie, if you want to see typical Indian family values and of-course love!
1804 0 I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early <PERSON>Sofia Loren</PERSON> film. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.<br /><br />I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of <ORGANIZATION>Sofia Loren</ORGANIZATION>'s early work. I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Surely, today, this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. It actually became annoying watching Ms. <PERSON>Loren</PERSON> in skin color paint throughout the film.<br /><br />Yes, this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then, the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.<br /><br />As beautiful as Ms. <PERSON>Loren</PERSON> was at age 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage. After all, we don't see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" back stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers. One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the <ORGANIZATION>J. G. Wentworth Company</ORGANIZATION> with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.<br /><br />The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality. The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.<br /><br />To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.<br /><br />Watch this film not because of the story of <PERSON>Aida</PERSON> nor the fact that this is an opera. Aside from Ms. <PERSON>Sofia Loren</PERSON> none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. <PERSON>Loren</PERSON> and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is.<br /><br /><PERSON>Larry</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>
1805 1 i thought this movie was really really great because, in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> cinemas nowadays, all you see is skin, music, and bad acting...in this movie, you can see some tradition, ethnicity, and at least some decency...although some parts were a little dramatic, guess what? that is what Indian cinema is all about! after watching this movie, at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music, or any violence, its just the truth, it teaches about love, and of course caring for the person you love throughout life...i think it was an amazing movie...Kids can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s sure profoundness...until all these rap hits, miniskirts, and skin showing became a part of it.
1806 0 1937's "<PERSON>Stella Dallas</PERSON>" with <PERSON>Barbara Stanwyck</PERSON> hasn't exactly aged well--how anyone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler. Perhaps they thought jaunty, cheerfully brash <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON> could make something out of it, but this hoary script defeats her. Plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock, and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life, can't escape tatty, old-fashioned trappings and sentiment. <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> works best with a movie director who can control her excesses, but that fails to happen here; <PERSON>Stephen Collins</PERSON> is stolid as the man who changes her life, but <PERSON>Trini Alvarado</PERSON> is well-cast as <PERSON>Midler</PERSON>'s daughter. This is what used to be referred to as a "woman's picture", a wallow, but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins. *1/2 from ****
1807 1 I can honestly say I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family films. I am far from a fan of <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON>. The director's last movie (MPKDH was complete stupidity. And the music was very boring and bland. But there was <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>, who has become my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also <PERSON>Seema Biswas</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON> who are very talented. So a few plus points.<br /><br />I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed. He brings us the young lovers of MPK with a pinch of the HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. The story outline is similar to <LOCATION>HAHK</LOCATION>, light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end. The director also made character that you could relate to. The thing I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. The casting adds to its perfection. <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> surprised me with a good performance. This is a major improvement, and most importantly he suits the role. The best is easily <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>. In fact, this is her best performance. Her screen presence is so electrifying, you are bound to love her performance. <PERSON>Sameer Soni</PERSON>, <PERSON>Amrutha Prakash</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON> and <PERSON>Seema Biswas</PERSON> are terrifically cast. Not one actor feels out of place. <br /><br />The songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them. <PERSON>Mujhe Haq Hai</PERSON> and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads. Milan <PERSON>Abhi Aada Adhura Hai</PERSON> is also nice in watching. The songs aren't colorful and dancey, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein which is bound to remind you of HSSH and <ORGANIZATION>HAHK</ORGANIZATION>. So what was the flaw in the movie? The movie gets quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched. But the movie is still goes at a good pace, making it a perfect family film.
1808 0 "<PERSON>Stella</PERSON>", starring <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON> in the title role, is an unabashed tearjerker. Set in upstate <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Stella Claire</PERSON> works nights as a bar maid, pouring and dancing in a workingman's saloon. One night, in comes a slumming medical intern, <PERSON>Stephen Dallas</PERSON>, who woos <PERSON>Stella</PERSON>, and in the course of their affair impregnates her. She spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion, sends him packing to a lucrative medical career, and raises her daughter herself in near-poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous, loving, young lady. Dr. <PERSON>Dallas</PERSON> is not out of the picture, still maintaining a tenuous, but caring relationship with his daughter andÂ…..I'm rambling, and worse yet, making the movie sound somewhat interesting. The acting and screenwriting are so over-the-top you'll let out a groan in almost every scene. The chief offender is <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON>, but close behind is <PERSON>John Goodman</PERSON> as her alcoholic buddy. Each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale, which is truly a hoot. Taken as a dramatic piece, this film rates no more than grade D, but as camp, it scores an unintended B+.<br /><br />
1809 1 <ORGANIZATION>Suraj Barjatya</ORGANIZATION> is best in movies on marriage. And here he is; back to his basics on <PERSON>Vivaah</PERSON>. As the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage. A movie you can watch with your entire family around you. A movie you will hate watching alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, cinematography is excellent, direction is best, everything about the movie has a class of its own. There are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart, you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>Shahid & Amrita jodi</ORGANIZATION> has given us hit movies earlier like <PERSON>Ishq Vishq</PERSON>, & <PERSON>Shikhar</PERSON>. Though <PERSON>Shikhar</PERSON> was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the public.A truly <ORGANIZATION>Shahid & Amrita</ORGANIZATION> film.
1810 0 An unmarried woman named <PERSON>Stella</PERSON> (<PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON>) gets pregnant by a wealthy man (<PERSON>Stephen Collins</PERSON>). He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own. Things go OK until the child named <PERSON>Jenny</PERSON> (<PERSON>Trini Alvarado</PERSON>) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse.<br /><br />I've seen both the silent version and sound version of "Stella Dallas". Neither one affected me much (and I cry easily) but they were well-made if dated. Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I guess <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to get this made. This (predictably) bombed. The story is laughable and dated by today's standards. Even though <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alvarado</PERSON> give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end. <PERSON>Stephen Collins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marsha Mason</PERSON> (both good actors) don't help in supporting roles. Flimsy and dull. Really--who thought this would work? See the 1937 <PERSON>Stanwyck</PERSON> version instead. I give this a 1.
1811 1 I had lost faith in <PERSON>Sooraj R. Barjatya</PERSON> after the movie Main <PERSON>Prem Ki Deewani hoon</PERSON>, then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good. But I didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj. I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie. <PERSON>Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot</PERSON> it right this time, okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke <PERSON>Hai Kaun</PERSON>. But I have always loved <PERSON>Manie Pyar kiya</PERSON>, after <PERSON>Manie Pyar kiya</PERSON> to me I think <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON> is <PERSON>Barjatyas</PERSON> best work. I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie.<br /><br />The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition. It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. When <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> meets <PERSON>Poonam</PERSON> for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> and <PERSON>Poonam</PERSON> meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song "Do Ajnabe" shows that very well. Getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Poonam</LOCATION> (<PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>) and there families. A twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box.<br /><br />What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Poonam</LOCATION>, how they fall for each other is too sweet. Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they first meet during and after the song "Do Anjane Ajnabe" It's very sweet to watch, She hardly says anything and <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other. It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with <PERSON>Poonam</PERSON> more then just <PERSON>Prem</PERSON>. When she finds happiness through <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. Which brings me to performances and <PERSON>Amrita Roa</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Poonam</LOCATION> is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> as <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> is amazing too, he is Poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since <ORGANIZATION>SRK</ORGANIZATION> and Kajol. If <PERSON>Ishq Vishk</PERSON> didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. "Mujhe Haq hai" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. Scenes which touched me was when <PERSON>Prem</PERSON> takes <PERSON>Poonam</PERSON> to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever.<br /><br />The direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie. The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop! The music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for?<br /><br />What I can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. Its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifeÂ…Well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing!
1812 0 Yes, this movie make me feel real horror, when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho - Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen . Believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie, i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I'm always supporting independent movies, when it deserves the support, but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies. I'm still traumatized. I will not trust in any nice cover anymore.
1813 1 <ORGANIZATION>VIVAH</ORGANIZATION> is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006 ! PERIOD !!. In my book it is one of the best 100 movies EVER MADE IN Bollywood. Its sad that this movie doesn't have that many reviews and isn't having that much popularity. <br /><br />VIVAH is once again a true achievement from a director who DOES it again. After HAHK and <PERSON>Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj</PERSON> has once again pulled off a brilliant one VIVAH. <br /><br />This is the most simple and cute movies that I've seen this year. After seeing <PERSON>Don</PERSON> 2 which was CRAP and later Dhoom 2 which even beat <PERSON>Don</PERSON> in that matter, I finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture.<br /><br />I don't know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> remake style crap movies like Dhoom 2 and don. <br /><br />The story is beautiful and relates much to the Indian system of Arranged marriage which I too would like to be a part of. Our system which teaches us to obey elders, follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie!. Of course there isn't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie. <br /><br />Coming back to the movie.....VIVAH is a story of Journey between the beautiful period of Engagement and marriage. The phase where the guy meets the girl !....Both understand each other ..Both try to assess if they could love each other for Seven generations (as our system says) and the various which occur during marriages.<br /><br /><PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> is brilliant in the movie.......<PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> is OK.....and <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON> are awesome !! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like the HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ......<br /><br />Overall A MUST SEE for anyone who still believes in the Indian culture and tradition and I certainly do !.<br /><br />Go see this movie......I just have to say one word.......<br /><br />BLISS !.
1814 0 I wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on DVD and being sorely disapointed.<br /><br />I tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself (ie no budget, shot on digi cam), I stand by my original comments. This is a no budget student project (and not a particularly good one), released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover). So deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not. I want my money back under the trades description act! Complete Rubbish!
1815 1 This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones.Its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around.Shahid <PERSON>Kapoor</PERSON> gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> who is also very <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> and she also acts pretty well...The genre of the movie is the same as HAHK and such movies deserve to be made in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> for the revival of old traditional values...The movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie,besides this it is flawless....
1816 0 After buying the DVD in a Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I popped it in the DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features...but when I played the movie itself, what a let down. It is the worst thing I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the movie here at IMDB is actually from the people who made the film. So Don't Believe It unless you like to waste your cash!
1817 1 I can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6.9. Anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real Indian movies I have ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema. As for the story I thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao. He is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy, while <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does so her Aunt dislikes <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> with a passion. This upsets <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that although <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>'s family wasn't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class, while Shahids family was quite upper class, they still treated their family with respect and didn't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me. This is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow. This movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything. All in all this movie deserved an 8/10 I wish more and more of these kind of movies were made.
1818 0 dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film. the way it is shot, lit, acted etc. just doesn't make sense. it's all so bad it is difficult to watch. loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom. there seems to be no 'normal' person in the entire film and the existence of the 'outside world' is, well, it just doesn't exist. and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden? this film is beyond stupidity. zero.
1819 1 I liked this movies. Its a another Yash raj film which you know will look good on screen, all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... Another rule of <PERSON>Yash raj</PERSON>'s film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. Think back to all of those films.. <PERSON>MPK Suman</PERSON> didn't have mom, <PERSON>HMAPK Salman</PERSON> didn't have parents, AND FINAL rule is that you are 90% likely to see <PERSON>Alock Nath</PERSON> crying...<br /><br />The film is good too. Its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. The little kid (hero's nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners. The actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life. this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in BIG house which I thou was a good Idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. There isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not it will inform and may be scare you ...<br /><br />Overall a very good looking film. No big plots or twists but a very gentle film, very much like Bollywood classic.
1820 0 The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor.<br /><br />There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script. <PERSON>Lena Endre</PERSON> was good looking as always.<br /><br />I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse.<br /><br />If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at.
1821 1 It is nice to see <PERSON>Suraj Barjatya</PERSON> back at what he is best at.A story woven around a marriage.It feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family. Though the story is simple and does not contain any new elements,you still like the movie,because of the presentation, performances,and actually the over all treatment. Hats Off to <LOCATION>Suraj</LOCATION>.. The movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love. The depiction of the changes in the way of thinking,behaving once you get engaged is excellent. Director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection.Though the movie is slow,you don't mind it,because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple. As a typical RajShree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears(specially ladies). But when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
1822 0 This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made. <br /><br />It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006.<br /><br />I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie. It shouldn't be that obvious. <br /><br />I can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this. If I had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before I saw the movie, it is gone for sure now. <br /><br />I've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and I can't understand how that is even possible.
1823 1 <ORGANIZATION>VIVAH</ORGANIZATION> in my opinion is the best movie of 2006, coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career. I am not too keen in romantic movies these days, because i see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, i have watched this movie three times now...and believe me it's an awesome movie.<br /><br />VIVAH goes back to the traditional route, displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In that sense <PERSON>Sooraj R. Barjatya</PERSON> has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />Several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately: <br /><br />* When <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> comes to see the bride (<PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene.<br /><br />* The first conversation between <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>, when he comes to see her - i.e. a shy <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation. Also <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>'s naive nature, limited eye-contact, shy characteristics and answering softly to <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON>'s questions.<br /><br />* The emotional breakdown of <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> and her uncle (<PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON>) when she feeds him at <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON>'s party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece.<br /><br />Clearly the movie belongs to <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> all the way. The actress portrays the role of <LOCATION>Poonam</LOCATION> with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the whole movie, and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly.<br /><br /><PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> performs brilliantly too. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than <PERSON>Salman Khan</PERSON> when it comes to acting in a <PERSON>Sooraj R. Barjatya</PERSON> film. In fact <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> make a cute on-screen couple, without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON> (Excellent), <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON> (Brilliant), <PERSON>Mohan Joshi</PERSON> (Very good).<br /><br />On the whole, <ORGANIZATION>VIVAH</ORGANIZATION> delivers what it promised, a well made and realistic story of two families. The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous <PERSON>Sooraj R. Barjatya</PERSON>. It's a must see!
1824 0 ...for one of the worst Swedish movies ever...forgive me for being dull.<br /><br />First of all i haven't seen the first one (i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one), well i hope the first one is better than this, it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes, For the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high (belive me so do i), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea, what's next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often, and this is a perfect example of one.<br /><br />OK i'm gonna be honest with you: i did laugh a bit, it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Just let some other idiot do it or download it.<br /><br />4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already...
1825 1 This movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old, where actors didn't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film.<br /><br />Firstly I think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>, it is definitely the making of the film.<br /><br />I have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy. In response to this, I think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis, however considering this is a Barjatya film I think that compared to MPK, <ORGANIZATION>HAHK</ORGANIZATION>, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been toned down significantly. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places.<br /><br />In this film however, when the sentimental moments come along, you find yourself smiling, wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them.<br /><br />Another major plus point is the performances of Shahid and <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>. Both have acted very well, especially <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> who looks great in the film. <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star.<br /><br />Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole, I do feel that it was too long. Some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact. I also think the music, although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available. Although the picturisation of the songs <PERSON>Mujhe Haq Hain</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hamari Shaadi Mein</PERSON> are wonderful.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this film, its romantic, looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (I won't go into details, just in case you haven't seen it.<br /><br />PS. If you're prone to crying-take a tissue! (I needed several)
1826 0 OK now, lets see. What was funny in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max, no good. A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, no good. <PERSON>Boatcrash</PERSON>, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are too may personalities they are following in this movie. This film should be about what is happening on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max. No good. All in all, I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts.
1827 1 This is one of the best movies to come from Bollywood in years. Certainly the best this year until now. Indian to the core, the panoramic visuals, the heart-pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one. The apt depiction of <LOCATION>Indianvalues</LOCATION> and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life.<br /><br />This movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses. If you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on-screen action, sex or terror, then this movie is not for you, because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it. It is as simple a story for a movie as it can get. But that's exactly where the art of the movie lies. One gets a real life experience, and the best thing is, this experience is one full of values and hope. It is about the positive side of life, about the sweet things that God has showered on humans, as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons, terrorists and underworlds. This is not about things and people that have gone bad. It is about the goodness that still persists, and that keeps the world running. Of course, every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths. <br /><br />Having said that, here's more... <br /><br />The movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage - yes, that's right, it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents, and learn to love each other. The 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time, not full of "enticing" happenings, but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other. They learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives, and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage. But have these been strengthened enough? Their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune. Will they pass this test? That is what "Vivah" is about.
1828 0 (Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed)<br /><br />I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.<br /><br />As much as I loved to see <PERSON>Janne</PERSON> "Loffe" <PERSON>Karlsson</PERSON> on the big screen again, the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water, isn't original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that ain't, is just plain boring. I smiled like three times during the entire film.<br /><br />The placement of Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign saying; "Findus made it happen!".<br /><br />GÃ¶ta <ORGANIZATION>Kanal</ORGANIZATION> 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on DVD, just wait for it to air on TV, it wont take too long.
1829 1 Vivah is by no means a classic. However in the days of hardcore action, path-breaking special effects & complex plots (none of which Bollywood has mastered yet), its quite refreshing to see a simple film like <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON>. The story as we all know is a journey from a couple's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times. Nothing more, nothing less. The music isn't quite in the same league as MPK or <ORGANIZATION>HAHK</ORGANIZATION> but doesn't jar your senses either. Two songs stood out for me - <PERSON>Mujhe Haq Hai</PERSON> & Do Anjaane. While <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi were hummable. <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential. Its good to see him play something else but the "cool dude" he normally does. <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl to perfection. <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON> & <PERSON>Seema Biswas</PERSON> are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. <ORGANIZATION>Suraj</ORGANIZATION>'s direction is simple but effective. The movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers. But all in all a good, clean, decent family movie.
1830 0 Yet another forgettable <ORGANIZATION>Warners</ORGANIZATION> foreign intrigue "thriller," this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of <PERSON>Lauren Bacall</PERSON>, who, without <PERSON>Humphrey Bogart</PERSON>'s tender attentions to humanize her, comes off as her usual shrill, shallow self. Even master gigolo <PERSON>Charles Boyer</PERSON> cannot feign romantic interest in her.
1831 1 All the talent Mr. <PERSON>Sooraj Barjatya</PERSON> showed in his first 3 movies, I thought were all an accident because his 4th one Main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad. But I have to say it wasn't an accident. This guy is talented and the way he has done <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON> is just brilliant. Right from the first scene it affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome. The chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol. As usual <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON> as the good and loving father is fantastic, so is <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON>. But its a Shahid-Amrita film.Amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom. this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life. All in all a brilliant film. hats off to Mr. <PERSON>Sooraj Barjatya</PERSON>...
1832 0 <PERSON>Lauren Bacall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Boyer</PERSON> do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we deal with a supposedly bungling <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON>. By the way, <PERSON>Bacall</PERSON> is as British as <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON>.<br /><br />The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner <PERSON>Katina Paxinou</PERSON>. As was the case with her memorable <PERSON>Pilar</PERSON> in the 1943 Oscar winner, "For Whom the Bell Tolls," <PERSON>Paxinou</PERSON> again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-Franco group. She is quite a vicious character here;especially, when she throws a 14 year old child out the window. She believed that <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> had given the child important material to hide.
1833 1 My Comments for VIVAH :- Its a charming, idealistic love story starring <PERSON>Shahid Kapoor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: "Come let me do your dressing"<br /><br />V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of Indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married .... playing by the rules ! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story .... no plot ... no villain - as is the case with most of <PERSON>Sooraj Barjatya</PERSON> films. <PERSON>Sooraj</PERSON> sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think <PERSON>AMRITA RAO</PERSON> - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to <PERSON>Shahid Kapur</PERSON> - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the <PERSON>Choti</PERSON> i.e. <PERSON>Amrita Prakash</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alok Nath</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON>'s bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after <ORGANIZATION>Maine Pyar Kiya</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain</ORGANIZATION>. The chemistry between <ORGANIZATION>Shahid & Amrita</ORGANIZATION> is AWESOME.<br /><br />Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married "officially", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in <LOCATION>Vivah</LOCATION>. There's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film. Some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing, that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage :) Thats Success if you ask me. it seems <PERSON>AMRITA RAO</PERSON> - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !! Hats off to her for this achievement <PERSON>Chalo</PERSON>, even though <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON> , <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> or <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to CHEER about !! Congrats to <PERSON>AMRITA RAO</PERSON>- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to <PERSON>Sooraj Barjatya</PERSON> for portraying her the best way :) Shudn't forget <PERSON>Shahid Kapur</PERSON> and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today !! Imagine, to share the same pedestal as the legendary <PERSON>Dilip Kumar</PERSON> .......... Its no mean achievement !! Congrats to <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> - for taking her Career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with <PERSON>Shahid Kapur</PERSON> !! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {<ORGANIZATION>Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla</ORGANIZATION>} ................. <br /><br />Some points that I observed,few of the elements :- #1 If u notice carefully, <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON> looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses. She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film !! Perfect Fit #2 <PERSON>Shahid Kapur</PERSON> is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage .... but <ORGANIZATION>PREM</ORGANIZATION> listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in <PERSON>Anupam Kher</PERSON>. Eventually "Honesty" & "Trust" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON>. Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also, Its possible !!! #3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where <ORGANIZATION>Shahid & Amrita</ORGANIZATION> are together - or shown to be together. Its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences :- Characterized by restraint, innocence & respect for the other ! #4 I really liked the relationship shown between <PERSON>Chacha ALOK NATH</PERSON> & <PERSON>Amrita Rao</PERSON>. These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. #5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes,songs are beautifully pictured !! Words like "Jal","praarthana" e.t.c. are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film :) Personally, I really am fond of many dialogs in this film. #6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where <PERSON>Shahid</PERSON> puts "sindhoor" to <PERSON>Amrita</PERSON> when shes struggling for Life - is terrific. Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE/I-cant-do-without-U ; Its a Hats-Off feeling !!! <br /><br />*** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of <PERSON>Maine Pyar Kiya</PERSON>, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De <LOCATION>Chuke Sanam</LOCATION> - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair :) :) *** IF U ASK ME :- Along with films like Rang De Basanti, <PERSON>Lage Raho Munnabhai</PERSON>, DOR, CORPORATE and <ORGANIZATION>Kabul Express</ORGANIZATION>, V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006. IN FACT - i think <PERSON>Vivah</PERSON> does deserve better viewing/business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies !!
1834 0 This Film was done in really poor taste. The script was really bad. I feel really sad for the late <PERSON>Gregory Peck</PERSON> who took on the title role of this B-movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals. The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War 2. There was a scene where I almost vomited, it showed <PERSON>Macarthur</PERSON> in a bunker in <LOCATION>Corregidor</LOCATION> island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded, one legged Filipino soldier. The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : `no papa, no mama, no uncle sam' and <PERSON>Macarthur</PERSON> gives his little pep talk that Americans `would never abandon' the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by <PERSON>Macarthur</PERSON>'s words and gives him a smart salute. I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake. It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption. It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE (<ORGANIZATION>United States Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION> of The Far East), these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military during world war 2, who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese, who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of <LOCATION>Bataan</LOCATION> and defended <LOCATION>Corregidor</LOCATION> island by launching a guerilla offensive after <PERSON>Macarthur</PERSON> left for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> with his famous `I shall return' speech. My late grandfather, a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country. I think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that <ORGANIZATION>Macarthur</ORGANIZATION> relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the <LOCATION>Leyte gulf</LOCATION> landing.
1835 1 I watched this in July and even with the Christmas theme, found it touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality-mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes don't make sense. <PERSON>William Russ</PERSON> did a grand job as <PERSON>Hank</PERSON>. I have only seen him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer where he played a weak character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes throughout, as <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender. <PERSON>Valerie Bertinelli</PERSON> was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role. And <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> as <PERSON>Max</PERSON> was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one where <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> realizes who <PERSON>Max</PERSON> really was in his life. It's not for everyone.....especially those who aren't into 'feel-good' movies and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one. But I think it is well-worth re-watching, which is why I taped it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. :)
1836 0 When <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> played the title role in "<PERSON>Patton</PERSON>," you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist, shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver, and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike. The most action we get from <PERSON>Gregory Peck</PERSON> as "<ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION>," a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment, is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his.<br /><br />Comparing <PERSON>Peck</PERSON>'s performance with <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s may be unfair. Yet the fact "MacArthur" was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels, as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>. It's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that Oscar-winning film of a few years before. But while <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> looks the part more than <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> ever did, he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a <ORGANIZATION>Wikipedia</ORGANIZATION> walkthrough of <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION>'s later career.<br /><br />"To this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived," an opening title crawl tells us. It's a typical dishwater bit of post-Vietnam sophistry about those who led <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s military, very much of its time, but what we get here is neither view. <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> as presented here doesn't anger or inspire the way he did in life.<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Joseph Sargent</PERSON>, who went on to helm the famous turkey "Jaws The Revenge," does a paint-by-numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use (as when the Chinese attack <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>), while the script by <PERSON>Hal Barwood</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matthew Robbins</PERSON> trots out a <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> who comes across as good-natured to the point of blandness, a bit too caught up in his public image, but never less than decent.<br /><br />Here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the <LOCATION>Phillipines</LOCATION>. There you see him addressing <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in his "Old Soldiers Never Die" speech. For a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in <LOCATION>Toyko</LOCATION>, waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule. <PERSON>Peck</PERSON>'s co-actors, <PERSON>Marj Dusay</PERSON> as his devoted wife ("you're my finest soldier") and <PERSON>Nicolas Coaster</PERSON> as a loyal aide, burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion's magnificence but garner no interest on their own.<br /><br />Even when he argues with others, <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence. When Admiral <PERSON>Nimitz</PERSON> suggests delaying the recapture of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> comes back with the comment: "Just now, as I listened to his plan, I thought I saw our flag going down." Doubtless the real Nimitz would have had something to say about that, but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of President <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>.<br /><br />The only person in the movie who <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> seriously disagrees with is <PERSON>Harry S Truman</PERSON>, who <PERSON>Ed Flanders</PERSON> does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble <PERSON>Toucan Sam</PERSON>. <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>'s firing of <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> should be a dramatic high point, but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation, in which <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> plays <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> as nothing less than a genial martyr.<br /><br />I've never been sold by <PERSON>Peck</PERSON>'s standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best-known roles. But it's unfair to dock him so much here, as he gets little help defining <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> as anything other than a speechifying bore. Except for two scenes, one where he rails against the surrender of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> ("He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet!") and another where he has a mini-breakdown while awaiting the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION>Inchon</LOCATION>, inveighing against Communists undermining him at the <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> really plays <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> here, not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet "American <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON>." The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.
1837 1 IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING A COPY OF THIS FILM PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM OF THIS DESCRIPTION: First telecast by <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> on November 30, 2003, the made-for-TV Finding John Christmas is a sequel to the previous year's A Town Without Christmas, with <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON> reprising his role as versatile guardian angel <PERSON>Max</PERSON>. <PERSON>Valerie Bertinelli</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Kathleen McAllister</PERSON>, a divorced small-town nurse whose depression... over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist <PERSON>Noah Greeley</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Cubitt</PERSON>). The picture shows an act of bravery performed by <PERSON>Noah</PERSON>'s firefighter brother <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> (<PERSON>William Russ</PERSON>), who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasn't been seen since. <PERSON>Hank</PERSON> would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when <PERSON>Noah</PERSON>'s newspaper posts a $50,000 reward to identify <PERSON>Hank</PERSON>, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there's something, very, very curious about that photo: It also shows a <ORGANIZATION>Santa Claus</ORGANIZATION> suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant. That elusive "<LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>" is of course the angelic <PERSON>Max</PERSON>, who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems, dispense advice, tie up loose plot strands--and even share a musical duet with <PERSON>Kathleen</PERSON>'s talented daughter <PERSON>Socorro</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jennifer Pisana</PERSON>).<br /><br />INTERESTED IN HAVING A COPY: WRITE TO ME HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
1838 0 Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.<br /><br />The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe but the <PERSON>Black Knight</PERSON> scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting " None Shall Pass" and " It's only a flesh wound, I've had worse". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year.<br /><br />The "gladiator/demon" was a stitch too. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. Kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.<br /><br />
1839 1 Having been a fan of 'Columbo', I was sorely disappointed in '<PERSON>Corky Romano</PERSON>'. While certainly a funny movie, <PERSON>Falk</PERSON>'s mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After '<PERSON>Corky Romano</PERSON>', I was honestly both surprised by and soured on Mr. <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON>. HOWEVER, having just seen 'Finding John Christmas' and its predecessor, 'A Town Without Christmas', for the first time within a week of each other, I have to say that '<PERSON>Max</PERSON>', <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Falk</PERSON>'s delightful character in both movies, is surely as memorable and lovable as 'Columbo'. While parts of the movie are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out. I too wish I had recorded both of these heartwarming Christmas movies, and I highly recommend them whether you're a <ORGANIZATION>Falk</ORGANIZATION> fan, a Christmas nut, or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week. This movie may end up lost among the throngs of made-for-TV holiday flicks, so be sure to find 'Finding John Christmas' before it's too late.
1840 0 Seriously. I just wrapped up my first viewing of Demonicus and words have failed me.<br /><br />I remember a time when I would see <PERSON>Charles Band</PERSON>'s name on a film and my heart would race. He was never a <PERSON>Wes Craven</PERSON> or a <PERSON>John Carpenter</PERSON>. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex, but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure.<br /><br />And now... this.<br /><br />A painfully-obvious Californian walking trail doubles for "the Alps" and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be "an ancient cave". I mean, they didn't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator, as the cover implies, we're treated to a dude wearing the latest in <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> Halloween apparel. There's a pretty cool looking corpse, who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers, but he doesn't even learn to stand until the final five minutes. Why couldn't he be the villain? Instead, we've got frat boy <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> with a plastic sword. Ouch.<br /><br /><PERSON>Charles Band</PERSON>... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe. I love movies that are so bad, they're good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad, its just bad. This one, however, is just unwatchable. A perfect example of making a buck, rather than making a quality film.
1841 1 This cute animated short features two comic icons - <PERSON>Betty Boop</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Henry</PERSON> is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.<br /><br />Well here he does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from <PERSON>Betty Boop</PERSON>'s pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.<br /><br /><PERSON>Betty</PERSON> sings a song about pets, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.
1842 0 I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time. She can act, but doesn't get a chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes. Must have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot direct to videotape. The production values make _<PERSON>Blair Witch</PERSON>_ look professional. There's a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects worth noting. This movie is bad, but not amusingly so. The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.
1843 1 PERHAPS in an attempt to find another "Hot Property" for adaptation, the Brothers <PERSON>Fleischer</PERSON> thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the Newspaper Comic Strip with their production of 1933's POPEYE THE SAILOR (<PERSON>Fleischer</PERSON> Studios/Paramount). Although it was a part of the BETTY BOOP Series, Miss B. only made a brief appearance in the short; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series.<br /><br />AS is now common knowledge, the gruff, squinty eyed, brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; outlasting and literally outliving the <ORGANIZATION>Fleischers</ORGANIZATION> and their Studio, lasting to this day.<br /><br />RETURNING to King Features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular HENRY Comic Strip character in a BETTY BOOP outing; objective being the seeking of another series. The reasoning then surely seemed sound. <PERSON>HENRY</PERSON> was a most popular feature in the Hearst Papers' line-up; appearing as both a Daily and on Sunday's <ORGANIZATION>Color Comics Supplement</ORGANIZATION>, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, "What Fools These Mortals Be!" Remember that one, <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON>? IN viewing the chubby, little, bald boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his on screen antics, both solo and in tandem with Miss <PERSON>Betty</PERSON>; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled. The story and Director <PERSON>Dave Fleischer</PERSON> both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>. These mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as the HENRY Feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime'.<br /><br />IN the cartoon, titled BETTY BOOP WITH <PERSON>HENRY</PERSON>: THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (<ORGANIZATION>Fleischer Studios/Paramount Pictures Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, 1935), we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of <PERSON>Dave Fleischer</PERSON>'s rapid fire, machine gun-like gags. In short, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> spots a puppy in the window of <PERSON>Betty Boop</PERSON>'s Pet Shop. It is a sort of love at first sight as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had, to coins in his pocket. He is in formed by Miss <PERSON>Boop</PERSON> that it would be $2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase. Tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly.<br /><br />BUT a reprieve is soon on the horizon as <PERSON>Betty</PERSON> asks the boy to mind the store, while she leaves on urgent business. In return for his services, Miss <PERSON>Betty</PERSON> promises him the little dog in return. Of course, they have a deal and <PERSON>Betty</PERSON> leaves.<br /><br />GETTING to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the <PERSON>Fleischer</PERSON> Crew to fire up a whole new string of gags; this time featuring bird seed, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>'s bald pate and push brooms. (But not all at once of course, <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON>!) <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>'s enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>BETTY</ORGANIZATION> returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>'s temporary custodial care. All bets were off, no doggie for <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>. He begins to leave; dejectedly; but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up. His head covered with bird seed, he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures; returning them to their pet store coop. Happily, the little fella leaves; but this time he has his own affectionate, little, face licking puppy.<br /><br /><ORGANIZATION>UNDOUBETLY</ORGANIZATION> this was a winning combination. We have the carefree, energy filled, free wheeling of the boy, the kindness of <PERSON>Betty</PERSON> and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation. <PERSON>Max</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dave Fleischer</PERSON> had given us a sort of almost minor mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy short.<br /><br />WE were quite surprised that no HENRY Series followed. Judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it certainly could have been sustained for some time. At any rate, this teaming was in many ways the best of the <PERSON>Betty Boop</PERSON> try out pictures. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer/Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and barely had any <PERSON>Betty Boop</PERSON> in it, save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the <PERSON>HENRY Short</PERSON> was much better than the two following King Features "tryouts", <PERSON>BETTY BOOP</PERSON> AND THE LITTLE KING and <PERSON>BETTY BOOP</PERSON> AND LITTLE JIMMY, both 1936.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!
1844 0 This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win), that is how far short this film falls. Now don't take this the wrong way, I love B-Movies, around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is.<br /><br />First of the story (for a B-Movie) isn't that bad, it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand, were not talking Friday 13th potential, but potential none the less. But what really lets this film down is the acting, at not one second do I believe anything, it's like watching <ORGANIZATION>QVC</ORGANIZATION> except the presenters on <ORGANIZATION>QVC</ORGANIZATION> tend to have a heavier tan.<br /><br />In summary I'd like to say I've seen worse films, but I can't.
1845 1 At least for a half hour a week. I haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks (ABC/CBS/NBC) in years. All of the lions are interesting, although <PERSON>Larry</PERSON> can get annoying at times. I really like the Middle earth action figures they bring in with Hunter. Most of the other characters are interesting as well. The sideshow of <PERSON>Siegfried</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> is entertaining at times, too. The animation is top notch, and definitely the best CG that has been done on a weekly TV show. Usually when they hire big names to star in a show, they're trying to hide a poor script or characters. Not entirely true in this show though, There's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting, but overall the characters stand on their own.<br /><br />This is definitely for 16 and up. There's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though, and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads. It's definitely not as crude and edgy as <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION>, but does bring some of the same "Bash everyone" feel to it. One example is that it makes fun of both <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barbara Streisand</PERSON> at the same time in one episode. <br /><br />Father of the Pride and other <ORGANIZATION>Dreamworks</ORGANIZATION> productions like <PERSON>Shrek</PERSON> also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, <PERSON>Pinky</PERSON> and the Brain, and Freakazoid. It's the same type of humor grown up. It may not be as witty as <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON>'s classic TV series, but it's still good.<br /><br />I hope that it finishes this season off well, and is renewed for future seasons. Otherwise I may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again.
1846 0 For some reason, various young couples hiking through the <LOCATION>Italian Alps</LOCATION> split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first. <PERSON>James</PERSON> (<PERSON>Gregory Lee Kenyon</PERSON>) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This shot-on-digital Full Moon release is stupid, senseless, has terrible acting and sound and the (<ORGANIZATION>Los) Angeles National Forest</ORGANIZATION> is a poor substitute for <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. However, it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance. Whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic Latin gibberish about demons and resurrection, <ORGANIZATION>Kenyon</ORGANIZATION>'s ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed. Oh well, at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast.
1847 1 I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD through <ORGANIZATION>Netflix</ORGANIZATION> as soon as I found that it was available. I had high expectations, and was not disappointed. It's funny, and the animation is excellent. That level of quality I would only have expected from feature films, so I'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it. Maybe the DVD release had improved animation? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult, and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It isn't only kids who like cute animated characters. It is nowhere near "raunchy" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it. I'm very disappointed that it was cancelled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie.
1848 0 WARNING SPOILERS***** A really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls. One of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon. It's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse.<br /><br />A waste of time for the viewers, as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on, the gore is ludicrous at best, and the acting is terrible, perfect pairing for such a bad script<br /><br />
1849 1 Father of the pride is a pleasant surprise: It is funny, witty and features some great voice acting. The show is about the family of a Lion who is acting as the attraction of <ORGANIZATION>Siegfried & Roy</ORGANIZATION> shows. Indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a kiddie-cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way. It is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed. I'd say I'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original, I've seen most of those stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
1850 0 okay, this movie f*ck in' rules. it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made. absolutely terrible, but you GOTTA see it. rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun, it's hilarious. and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint. awesome. okay, rent it just for this one scene: two characters are actually WALKING IN PLACE for about 3 minutes in a shot. the director (on the commentary) says "yeah, the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're...". yeah, right man, they are totally walking in place. it's so funny.
1851 1 One word: suPURRRRb! I don't think I have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television. Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid TV schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs. <br /><br />I have to say I had my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show. But when half an hour was over (by the way, thank you, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, for running a commercial-free show), I was left with the feeling of instant love, love at first glance, the true love that one feels in his guts. Everything about this show screamed EXCELLENCE.<br /><br />Graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. No small feat considering those movies took years to be developed.<br /><br />Cast was marvelous. I am partial to <PERSON>John Goodman</PERSON>'s voice, but the rest of the team certainly were on par with <PERSON>John</PERSON>. Special mention: <PERSON>Lisa Kudrow</PERSON>'s guest appearance. She was on top of the game creating neurotic, pudgy, and lovable panda with a Jewish streak in her. (Panda from <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>? Only in this show.) <br /><br />Script was funny, with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp, yet not tacky. A note for all parents: this is NOT for children. This show was never advertised as such, and there's a reason why it's set for 9PM, not 8PM. So if you'd like to complain about "objectionable context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and Father of the Pride is it. <br /><br />Not everything was perfect. I was a bit puzzled by <PERSON>Siegfried</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roy</PERSON>'s characters. Do I sense "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are flamboyant. Yes, they speak with German accents. But that's yesterday's news. Give us something new, something fresh, something funny. Putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star power" that these guys have. That's fine by me. But please don't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart. Hopefully, the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over. <br /><br />In general, the show is definitely a Must-See-TV. Funny, witty, with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there haven't been a comedy this good since Seinfeld. I am certainly looking forward to the next episode.
1852 0 This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus. This adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /><br />The spirit of Tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list (killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in Latin) by possessing the body of a college guy. He uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this, which the college boy willingly puts on his head, and then at several points in the movie, takes off and puts back on.<br /><br /><PERSON>Maria</PERSON> performs oral sex on a poor man's <PERSON>Sean Willian Scott</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Tyrannus</PERSON> wears the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason, and has apparently been sitting next to CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Utter misfortune.<br /><br />This movie is empty and will hurt you. See it.
1853 1 I don't know why some people criticise that show so much.<br /><br />It is a great, funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still...<br /><br />The family dynamics are funny, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing.<br /><br />This show was well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it.<br /><br />rating: 8/10
1854 0 I mean really, how could <PERSON>Charles Band the head of Full Moon</PERSON> let a total stink-ball like DEMONICUS out. I mean it should never got the green light to begin with. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story on Tyranus other then he's a bad dude. Then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending. That's right a bad ending, Demonicus rises. The last survivor escapes a deadly cave in, then a picture of Chimera comes to life, cheaply I might add and chases her out. Then as she is walking home ala FUNHOUSE. A statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her. I mean, that makes no sense. What the hell was <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made, with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas then DEMONICUS. THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
1855 1 "Father of the Pride " was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life . And that is pretty sad ,specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air ( think in "The Simple life ") I admit that are many similarities with this show and "The Simpsons" ,but despite the similarities ,the show have it own merits . The animation is just adequate ,not incredible ,but is good .The best are the characters . All the animals are very likable and funny , and even <PERSON>Sigfried</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> had their moments . The music was good ,I liked many of the songs .<br /><br />Even if the show isn't very original ,I think that this had lots of potential .Like "<ORGANIZATION>Mission Hill</ORGANIZATION> " a show that isn't very famous but I liked a lot , this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved . What a shame .
1856 0 This movie is so awful, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so ridiculous.A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented, perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel ashame, because I paid for this lousy Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)
1857 1 I had watched as much of the series as I could manage to watch on television, but unfortunately, started a job that got me working evenings. I managed to catch some recordings of it, at least... and, of course, purchased the recently released DVD of the complete series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first, but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done. The voices are well suited to the characters, and the writing is excellent. It's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes. Thing is, with the way society has come in the last century, you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life. It's your typical sitcom in that regard, but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or Saturday Night Live... back when SNL was actually funny. Good job, <ORGANIZATION>Dreamworks</ORGANIZATION>. Perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going... and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs. It's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though. Hmm...
1858 0 My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.
1859 1 Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since Family Guy. It was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at <ORGANIZATION>Dreamworks Animation</ORGANIZATION>. Like The Simpsons, the show centers around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable supporting characters including <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> the surly orangutan, <PERSON>Vincent</PERSON> the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers <PERSON>Blake</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, the faux patriotic <ORGANIZATION>Snout Brothers</ORGANIZATION> and Chutney the elephant. The other stars of the show are the Sigfreid and <PERSON>Roy</PERSON>. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner, making the most mundane activities entertaining. The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues (drugs, prejudice, etc) is the source of the program's brilliance.<br /><br />The blame for this show's failure lies with <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>. They opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote) rather than the more logical production order. Several times, the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of such dreck as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough)! It is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate.<br /><br />Luckily, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following. 10/10
1860 0 Some kids are hiking in the mountains, and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers.<br /><br />This thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense:<br /><br />1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away!<br /><br />2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost.<br /><br />3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the...? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.<br /><br />4) A wounded girl attacks <PERSON>Demonicus</PERSON> and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information.<br /><br />5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help.<br /><br />And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. <br /><br />None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense.<br /><br />Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.
1861 1 I'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge gets a visit from three spirits (the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways. <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite.<br /><br />While I grew up watching the 1951 version starring <PERSON>Alastair Sims</PERSON>, and I believe that he is the definitive Scrooge, I have been impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> plays a convincing and mean <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON>, and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing. <PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> is a good <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON> as well.<br /><br />This version is beautifully filmed, and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980's) which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version.<br /><br />This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
1862 0 I cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made. There are about four good looking shots (the director should think about switching to still photography) and that's it. A strong cast is utterly wasted, scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new. Please spare yourself this movie.
1863 1 I enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite. <PERSON>George C.Scott</PERSON> gives a depth to the Scrooge character that the others do not give. The movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him. <br /><br />This movie has the best Tiny <PERSON>Tim</PERSON> by far. He is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films. <PERSON>Anthony Walters</PERSON> still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /><br /><PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> is wonderful as <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under Scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for. <PERSON>Susannah York</PERSON> and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life. <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON> is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen. Most often he is played as a jolly <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> type character. In this he shows anger at Scrooges attitudes and really makes Scrooge reconsider. <br /><br />The costumes and the sets really bring the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> of <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> time to life. A wonderful movie.
1864 0 I watched this movie, and hoped for something to get better the entire time. What is so great about a guy with no emotion? *yawn*<br /><br />You never see <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> show emotion for anyone other than his son. Yeah, I know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper (if you can call it that), I get it.<br /><br />Characters are undeveloped, relationships aren't given enough time to be understood. In one scene <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> says they won't fall in love, and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this film.<br /><br />It's like someone watched <PERSON>Boogie Nights</PERSON> and wrote this part to mimic <PERSON>Little Bill</PERSON>. Even the scene where he "loses his temper" is the same as when <PERSON>Little Bill</PERSON> shoots his wife, down to the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, <PERSON>William H. Macy</PERSON> is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there, done that - can you say Magnolia?<br /><br />This movie didn't only lack emotion, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters, and a plot. And it certainly lacks my recommendation. :)<br /><br />~A~
1865 1 *********Ten out of Ten Stars********* <br /><br />It's hard to believe this was a made for television movie. Just the phrase, "made of TV", makes me shudder. The production values for made for TV movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios. That being said, this version of the "Christmas Carol" should have been released in theaters, because it IS that good. It's my personal favorite of all the "Christmas Carol" movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>, but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes.<br /><br /><PERSON>Scott</PERSON> turns in a stellar performance as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>, he's a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded. The costuming, location shooting, and winter backdrop are mesmerizing. The musical score is endearing and heart warming. Add to that, solid directing, flawless cinematography, and faithful scripting; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic. It really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon it will be. This film has turned into a yearly Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas: Love, selflessness, and giving. In as selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in "The Christmas Carol", starring <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>.
1866 0 Undeveloped/unbelievable story line,(by the time I sort of figured out where it was going, I no longer cared) bad casting.(come on... <PERSON>William Macy</PERSON> as a hit man???) bad directing,(have you ever seen <PERSON>Tracey Ullman</PERSON> perform SO badly?)(Was I supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent, uncaring <PERSON>John Ritter</PERSON> character?) bad script...( Really, I'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful) the only Really good thing in it was the kid. Ten lines? It's not OK if your comment is less than ten lines? COme on-- whose rules are those? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines??? Isn't that kind of arbitrary? Why isn't it OK to have less than 10 lines of comment?
1867 1 I saw this movie in sixth grade around Christmas Time, and I was really excited about seeing it, and when I heard that <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> was in it, I was really excited, because I really love <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>! When me and my class were watching this movie, I was really into it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought that it was totally fabulous! This is the best version of <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>' classic novel that I have seen so far! <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>'s performance as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> is something else, I thought that he was the perfect choice, he was <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>, he is the definitive Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is the one with <PERSON>Patrick Stewart</PERSON>, but this is the better one! <br /><br />What it really great about this is the acting, I thought that the actors were fabulous, everyone was, the spirits, <PERSON>Tiny Tim</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>, everyone, they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts! But the best part of the movie was <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>! When I saw him, I thought that he was the absolute best! He is the definitive <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON>, I do not think that they could have found someone better! I don't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /><br />This movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>, and I really think that you will agree, you will think that this movie is fabulous! I am probably going to have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought that it was totally fabulous! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON>, period. <br /><br />10/10
1868 0 <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ullman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sutherland</PERSON> were as great as usual. <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> wasn't bad either. What's her name was as pretty as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring.<br /><br />From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine. The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity.<br /><br />Finally, too bad the script writer wasn't the victim. Especially with the "precocious" lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Again, it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score.
1869 1 In our household, we are enormous fans of A Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> and watch virtually every version each Christmas, including the old 1938 <PERSON>Reginald Owen</PERSON> and the modern 1999 <PERSON>Patrick Stewart</PERSON>. Our overall favorite is the 1951 black & white classic, because <PERSON>Alastair Sim</PERSON> IS <PERSON>Ebeneezer Scrooge</PERSON> and his conversion rings the truest. However, this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story, quite faithful generally to <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' novel. (See my comments on the other film adaptations, if interested)<br /><br />First of all, <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't make a bad Scrooge. I adore his sideburns, his long topcoat & hat. He cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot, and quite a handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> is enjoying his role as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought!<br /><br />This rendition has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending. Filmed in the town of <LOCATION>Shrewsbury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, it just seems somehow very British. The film has a lovely musical score, with wonderful, lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale. Sometimes I could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper! <br /><br /><PERSON>Marley</PERSON>'s anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three Spirits are all quite convincing. Christmas Past is a lovely ethereal lady, Christmas Present wonderfully giant and jovial, Christmas Yet To Come shrouded and foreboding as always. However, I found <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON>Fred</PERSON>, a wee bit quiet & grim, not nearly as jolly & hearty as he should be. I like the nephew's wife, whom they've named <PERSON>Janet</PERSON>, with her lovely, sprightly period hairstyle. Instead of blind man's bluff, they've concocted a game called Similes for the nephew's Christmas dinner party, which is a cute little touch, <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> getting right into the spirit of the thing.<br /><br />The Cratchits and their somewhat meagre (though much appreciated) Christmas dinner are well depicted, with <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Warner</PERSON>) suitably sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles of scarf. Mrs. <PERSON>Cratchit</PERSON> is charmingly portrayed by <PERSON>Susannah York</PERSON>, who also starred with <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of <PERSON>Jane Eyre</PERSON>. Above all, this version has unquestionably the best Tiny <PERSON>Tim</PERSON>, not only an adorable & endearing little waif but sickly. With those dark circles under his eyes, the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour!<br /><br />This is a delightful & heartwarming version of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere, it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
1870 0 Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.<br /><br />From the first, <ORGANIZATION>BU</ORGANIZATION> is just a chase film. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.<br /><br />If you haven't see the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost. If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.<br /><br /><PERSON>Paul Greengrass</PERSON>'s dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON> and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He gets blown up. He clears tall buildings. <PERSON>Yada yada yada</PERSON>. Above all - he SURVIVES. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He'll survive. Yawn.<br /><br />There's a girl thrown into the mix because <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON>'s love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. I've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain <PERSON>Scarlet</PERSON>.<br /><br /><PERSON>Bourne</PERSON>'s own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.<br /><br />The 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better end now before the slide continues.<br /><br />I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /><br />The idea that it 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is utter crap. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
1871 1 This version of the <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON> novel features <PERSON>George C Scott</PERSON> as the Scrooge. Fine casting, especially the choice of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, who plays the role to the hilt..a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption. A Modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten..9
1872 0 I don't understand people. Why is it that this movie is getting an 8.3!!!!!!???? I had high hopes for this movie, but once i was about a half hour into it I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they've seen (or of the summer, year, etc.) They say it's an excellent conclusion. WTF!!!!!!!!!?????? What has been concluded (besides the fact that <LOCATION>Bourne</LOCATION> can ride motorcycles, shoot, and fight better than anyone else he comes across)? What do you learn about <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON>'s character in this movie?????????Absolutely f****** nothing!!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so great about the action in this movie?? I don't like the cinematography and film editing. The shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used TOO much and they get old fast (I didn't mind them in Supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess) and made me quite dizzy. I was quickly wishing I had saved my $$$ for something else.<br /><br />This movie has no plot. All this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen. <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON>, who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie, is a perfectionist at everything he attempts. There is absolutely no character development in this movie, you know nothing about anyone, and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment. Some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense. ???????????!!!!!!!! What writing???? What suspense??? There's no suspense. <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON> is so perfect at doing everything he does, I don't think he has anything to worry about. If this is the best movie of the year 2007 I may just quit watching movies entirely!!!! <br /><br />Many people have also said that <PERSON>Matt Damon</PERSON>'s performance in this movie is one of the best (if not the best) of his career. What performance?? How many lines did he have in this movie??? I have some respect for <PERSON>Damon</PERSON> because he has been in movies that I liked and has played different kinds of characters, but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next, someone who chooses different types of roles. Not someone who plays the same roles over and over again (which <PERSON>Damon</PERSON> doesn't do, but an example of someone who does is <PERSON>Vin Diesel</PERSON>).<br /><br />Anyways, this movie was a BIG disappointment to me. I do not recommend this movie but I do recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I most definitely recommend reading the three books (which are much different then the movies).
1873 1 Everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories Â– a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on Christmas Eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains. So that he can avoid his partner's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of Christmases past, present and yet to come, so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late. A rather morbid tale one might think, but it is classic <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>, and also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time.<br /><br />To me this is the definitive version of <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' timeless story; it's the one I always remember watching in school, and I remember being absolutely terrified by it! The ghost of <PERSON>Jacob Marley</PERSON>, the final scene with the ghost of Christmas present under the bridge, and the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come especially I found very frightening. How on earth did the film gain the 'U' certificate? (For non-UK readers 'U' is the lowest classification, it means family friendly and children welcome, nothing to scare them etc... This is certainly not the case though, as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper-like spectre of Christmas future.<br /><br />Be that as it may, from the many versions of this classic story I have seen adapted for film, this is possibly the most faithful to the book. Most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of Christmas present showing Scrooge the two children hidden under his robe (you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays!). The two children represent Ignorance and Need (although changed to Want in this film).<br /><br />Criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes, the main one of which being that <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>'s portrayal of Scrooge seems simply not cold enough. He laughs too much. I don't want to use the word jolly because of course Ebeneezer is anything but, but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man, rather than the positively unkind, cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films. <PERSON>Patrick Stewart</PERSON> portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed, and <PERSON>Michael Caine</PERSON>, despite acting alongside the Muppets, was positively cold. Further, the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent. He appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit's final lesson.<br /><br />But ignoring this one (albeit major) quibble, it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart-warming Christmas tale, as all Christmas films should be. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow-covered English town that many Americans probably imagine it still is (the truth is that even then that <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> was grey and grimy Â– and any snow would never have been so white!) And everyone is so impeccably dressed too, even the poor people look rather dapper. But of course it's a Christmas film, so why shouldn't everything look nice? Perfect holiday season viewing; coupled with copies of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street and The Snowman and you've got everything you need.
1874 0 How sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be. As soon as a few critics say something new is good (ie - "Shake-Cam"), everyone jumps on the bandwagon, as if they are devoid of independent thought. This was not a good movie, it was a dreadful movie. 1) Plot? - What plot? <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON> was chased from here to there, from beginning to end. That's the plot. Don't look for anything deeper than this. 2) Cinematography? - Do me a favor! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job (I am not exaggerating here). This film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work. The ridiculous shaking of EVERY (I really do mean every) scene will cause dizziness and nausea. 3) Believable? - Oh yes definitely. This is a masterpiece of credibility. I loved scenes about <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON> being chased by (local) police through the winding market streets of <LOCATION>Tangier</LOCATION>. - I've BEEN to <LOCATION>Tangier</LOCATION>. Even the guides can't navigate their way through those streets but <PERSON>Bourne</PERSON> shook off 100 police with speed and finesse. <PERSON>Greengrass</PERSON> must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples. 4) Editing? - I don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds. I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the "scenes" flashing by. 5) Directing? - Hmmm. This is an interesting aspect. The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing. More a case of <PERSON>Greengrass</PERSON> throwing a copy of the script (all two pages) at the cameramen and told to "shoot a few scenes whilst drunk". - "Don't worry boys, we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room". The editor should be tarred, feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6) Not one but TWO senior <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood <PERSON>Jason Bourne</PERSON>. - Putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a traitor. Talk about stupid nincompoops. (Whilst the evil male <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor). (well, all men are evil, aren't they? - Except for SNAGS of course). Yes, this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity. 7) When the you-know-what finally hits the fan, good triumphs over evil (just like it always does, eh?) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on <PERSON>Jason Bourne</PERSON> - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger (Yeah - right...) - at that very moment, the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger. - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath? Wonders will never cease 8) Don't worry, there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts. Well, we can't have nasty, politically incorrect, <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> operatives going round shooting people, can we? How lovely to see a true to life P.C. film of the Noughties. -------------The Bourne Ultimatum is utter rubbish.
1875 1 When this initially aired in 1984, my wife and I taped it on our very first VHS recorder. I still have that aging tape, which I try to watch annually. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times -- many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background. I finally broke down this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie. <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>' story is captured in outstanding fashion here. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is absolutely amazing and totally believable as Scrooge. The supporting cast is equally spectacular. This is, to my mind, a flawless production. Little details add much to the enjoyment. The game "similes" Scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item. (I've since re-created it with my high school English students as a brief respite from class work!) Honestly, I can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays I enjoy more than indulging in this <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> production, which was originally sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> commercials ... which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years. Amazing how things have changed!) Bottom line: A Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> is a timeless story, and this rendition is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God Bless Us, Every One!
1876 0 I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity I turned the channel. The original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for <PERSON>Adam West</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burt Ward</PERSON>. Put these two "actors" in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad.
1877 1 Although <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON>.<br /><br />Particularly effective is when he confronts <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON> in his office at the movie's end. As <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Augmented by <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like <PERSON>Marlon Brando</PERSON>'s first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The Horror," indeed! <br /><br />However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. To put it another way, the "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after," even though he really shouldn't be. It's what you might call the "Doctor <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>" effect, since <PERSON>Jonathan Harris</PERSON> used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).<br /><br />Actually, I myself don't consider <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s glib rage a liability. But other "Christmas Carol" purists might. See the film and judge for yourselves.
1878 0 I loved the <PERSON>Batman</PERSON> tv series and was really looking forward to this. But they tried to do too much.<br /><br />Why they had the story of <PERSON>Adam West</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burt Ward</PERSON> trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. I don't want to knock <PERSON>Burt</PERSON> or <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> for the way they look now.....It's been 35 years since they appeared at <PERSON>Batman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad. I would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary. The batmobile side story was stupid.<br /><br />As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and left out way too much. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I'd like more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker. That was it on those 2.<br /><br />I'd love to read the book. I am sure it has more in it that this showed. Like why was there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was <PERSON>Commishioner Gordon</PERSON>, Cheif OHara, <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>, Mister Freeze, King <PERSON>Tut</PERSON>, etc. the List goes on. Like I said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it.<br /><br />Very disappointing. And really corny.
1879 1 Okay, there are a ton of reviews here, what can I possibly add?<br /><br />I will try anyway. <br /><br />The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing. The sets, outdoor locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by <PERSON>Roger Rees</PERSON>. His understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me. <PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> is also a totally believable <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>. His is a difficult life, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /><br />The best part of course- is <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON>. Some have said his portrayal too gruff. I couldn't disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh, weren't out of character. He is a terribly disillusioned man who's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth. <br /><br />During the flashbacks, it's obvious that he isn't all gruff. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he was totally gone, his partner <PERSON>Marley</PERSON> would never have come for his sake in the first place. And after all, we are none of us past hoping. I think that is a HUGE part of what <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> was trying to say. When <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> looks in on his dance at his employer's with <PERSON>Belle</PERSON>, you see him smile regretfully as he tells <PERSON>Belle</PERSON> in the flashback that he will go through life "with a grin on my face." <PERSON>Clive Donner</PERSON> was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they get left on the editing room floor.<br /><br />And finally, his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy EVERY time I see it. His apology to his nephew <PERSON>Fred</PERSON>, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to <PERSON>Fred</PERSON>, to his wife are so apparent. And the line that gets me every time, "God forgive me for the time I've wasted." <br /><br /><PERSON>Bravi</PERSON> tutti!
1880 0 Okay guys, we know why we watch film like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A all over the place (with a lot more T than A). But...shouldn't there be a story to go with it?<br /><br />"C'mon," I can hear you say - "this is just girls gettin' naked! Who needs a story??!"<br /><br />Well, if this were called "The NAKED Maniacs", I wouldn't have a problem. But since these guys are cribbing from "The Invisible Man", they need to have a bit of story hereabouts, you know, to keep your mind busy.<br /><br />However, all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he cracks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. And when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after, you'll be grateful.<br /><br />One star, for the T and A, but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans, so proceed with caution.<br /><br />TIDBIT - yes, it's THAT <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>.
1881 1 OK. I'm biased. I live near <LOCATION>Shrewsbury</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, where this wonderful movie was filmed. It still looks the same now. I remember them filming here quite vividly, and the fake snow on the streets for days on end. Often, when I'm walking through <LOCATION>Shrewsbury</LOCATION> I see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film.<br /><br /><PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>'s Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. His physical appearance isn't the typical miser. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s is big and imposing. A man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior.<br /><br />We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most cherished works in the English language. And I don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption. This film version portrays all of that quite beautifully. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> may be American but he plays the part of the English miser with wonderful skill.<br /><br />I love this movie. If you haven't seen this version I would strongly urge that you do. It's usually available for a very small amount of money... or are you too mean?
1882 0 This movie is just plain bad. It isn't even worth watching to make fun of it. The lunatic professor is just plain annoying. Even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility (which I glady do for the sake of good bad movies) and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie, this movie asks for even more than that. If you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes, and random sexual encounters, get a porn, if you are looking for a good-bad movie, get something else. If you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie, rent this.
1883 1 I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. I actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations. I have now purchased the DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life" I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is excellent and a superb cast led by <PERSON>Roger Rees</PERSON> surrounds him! <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can someone be remembered as both <PERSON>Patton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>? <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> does so easily. The direction is marvelous with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time, place and era depicted. You will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
1884 0 Saw this late one night on cable. At the time I didn't know that the girl billed as "<PERSON>Shannon Wilsey</PERSON>" was actually porn star <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel. I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy--more than the next guy, actually--but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid. The truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director's, writers' and special effects people's virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie's only saving grace. <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, before she turned into the plasticized <PERSON>Barbie Doll</PERSON> she became as a porn queen, is really interesting to watch--she's drop-dead gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times, glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time, which is more than can be said for the audience. For even though <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked, it still can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly made and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes on cable some night, check it out, but don't waste your money on a rental.
1885 1 This is the best film version of <PERSON>Dicken</PERSON>'s classic tale. I've seen it over and over on VHS, and recently acquired the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not wide-screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> since 1984. My biggest surprise is <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON>, "the Equalizer", as the Ghost of Christmas Present.
1886 0 Here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "low budget" a horrible name. Our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization". Students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right? Nope! It's not an example of high camp fun, which is way, WAY off the mark. A glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place. Bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best, aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies. Atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so rest easy!
1887 1 I saw a lot films about <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>' Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON>. But this one is the best of all! There is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book. The actors (<PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> and others) are great! Unfortunately, you can't often watch the film in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
1888 0 Take one look at the cover of this movie, and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film. This is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments. Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives, the story is actually interesting at some points, although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends. The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot, which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention.<br /><br />In The Nutty Professor, a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer, whereas in The Invisible Maniac, a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible, allowing him to spy on (and kill, for some reason) his students. Boring fodder. Don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this, and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick...
1889 1 You could stage a version of <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>' "A Christmas Carol" with sock puppets and I'll probably watch it. Ever since I was a child, this has been one of my favorite stories. Maybe it's the idea that there is good in everyone, and that therefore no one is beyond redemption, that appeals to me, but for whatever reason I never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they're on TV as they inevitably are this time of year.<br /><br />What makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles. Lines we've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity, and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble.<br /><br /><PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> was nominated for an Emmy in 1985 for this role. It is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft-portrayed role of <LOCATION>Scrooge</LOCATION>, he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was, in my opinion, one of his finest performances ever. He wisely did not attempt a British accent, instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice. His Scrooge is not merely a cranky old man (as he is so often portrayed), but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world. As he is visited in turn by each of the Three Spirits, we understand how this anger took root, grew, and ultimately strangled his soul. As he is forced to review his life, we see him alternately softening, and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy. And in the great dramatic scene when he, kneeling and weeping at his own grave, begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life, we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> has made Scrooge utterly believable and painfully human.<br /><br />Impressive as <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s performance is, the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty. <PERSON>Fred Holywell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>'s nephew, is an excellent example of this. Often portrayed as an affable buffoon, here he is played by <PERSON>Roger Rees</PERSON> with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals. When he implores <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>, "I ask nothing of you. I want nothing from you. Why can't we be friends?", we see in his face not only his frustration, but his pain at <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>'s self-imposed separation from his only living relative. It is a moving performance, and one of the movie's most dramatic scenes.<br /><br />Even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful English actor <PERSON>Frank Finlay</PERSON> as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>'s late partner, <PERSON>Jacob Marley</PERSON>. In most versions of this tale, the scene with <PERSON>Marley</PERSON> tends to be a bit of a low point in the film, simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly, and the results are usually just plain silly (ooooh, look, it's a scary ghost.......not!) In this version, it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie. <PERSON>Marley</PERSON>'s entrance, as the locks on Scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house, is wonderfully creepy. But <PERSON>Finlay</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Marley</PERSON> is no ethereal spirit. He is a tortured soul, inspiring both horror and pity. <PERSON>Marley</PERSON> may be a ghost, but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth, and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress, are still very human. As portrayed by <PERSON>Finlay</PERSON>, we have no problem believing that even the flinty Scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition. <PERSON>Finlay</PERSON> really steals the scene here, something not easy to do when you're opposite <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>.<br /><br />And it just goes on and on, one remarkable performance after another, making it seem like you're experiencing this story for the first time. <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON> (remember him from the Equalizer?) is by turns both jovial and menacing as the Ghost of Christmas Present. When he delivers the famous line, "it may well be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than MILLIONS like this poor man's child" he is no longer a jolly Santa Claus surrogate, but an avenging angel who gives Scrooge a much needed verbal spanking.<br /><br /><PERSON>Susannah York</PERSON> is a wonderfully tart tongued Mrs. <PERSON>Cratchit</PERSON>, and <PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> brings marvelous depth to the long suffering <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>, a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty, a sick child, and an insufferable boss. His face alternately shows his cheerful courage, and also, at times, his weariness, in the face of intolerable circumstances. Later, in the scene in which <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> is shown by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come the <PERSON>Cratchit</PERSON> family after the death of <PERSON>Tiny Tim</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>'s performance, while hardly uttering a word, will move you to tears.
1890 0 The Invisible Maniac starts as a young <PERSON>Kevin Dornwinkle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Kris Russell</PERSON>) is caught by his strict mother (<PERSON>Marilyn Adams</PERSON>) watching a girl (<PERSON>Tracy Walker</PERSON>) strip through his telescope... Cut to 'Twenty Years Later' & <PERSON>Kevin Dornwinkle</PERSON> (<PERSON>Noel Peters</PERSON>) is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a 'mollecular reconstruction' serum. However during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails & they all laugh at him, <PERSON>Dornwinkle</PERSON> goes mad kills a few of them & is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes. Jump forward 'Two Weeks Later' & a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress Mrs. Cello (<PERSON>Stephanie Blake</PERSON> as <PERSON>Stella Blalack</PERSON>) says that she has hired a replacement, yes you've guessed it it's Dornwinkle. The student don't take to him & treat him like dirt, however <PERSON>Dornwinkle</PERSON> has perfected his invisibility serum & uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges & his desire for revenge...<br /><br />Co-written & directed by <PERSON>Adam Rifkin</PERSON> wisely hiding under the pseudonym <PERSON>Rif Coogan</PERSON> (I wouldn't want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either) The Invisible Maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff. The script by <PERSON>Rifkin</PERSON>, sorry <PERSON>Coogan</PERSON> & <PERSON>Tony Markes</PERSON> is awful. It tries to be a teenage sex/comedy/horror hybrid that just fails in every department. For a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes & a few boob shots, not much else I'm afraid & the birds in The Invisible Maniac aren't even that good looking. The comedy is lame & every joke misses by the proverbial mile, this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jason Logan</PERSON>) a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny. The Invisible Maniac makes the <ORGANIZATION>Police Academy</ORGANIZATION> (1984 - 1994) series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication! As for the horror aspect that too is lame. It's also an incredibly slow (it takes over half an hour before Dornwinkles even becomes invisible), dull, predictable, boring & has highly annoying & unlikable teenage character's.<br /><br />Director <PERSON>Rifkin</PERSON> or <PERSON>Coogan</PERSON> or whatever does absolutely nothing to try & make The Invisible Maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience. There's no scares, tension or atmosphere & as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through. He does nothing with the invisibility angle, just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets. There is very little gore or violence, a bit of splashing blood, a few strangulations & the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun, unfortunately he was invisible at the time & we only get to see the headless torso afterwards.<br /><br />The budget must have been low, & I mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film. Dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet! When he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him & the entire school has about a dozen pupils & two teachers. The Invisible Maniac is a poorly made film throughout it's 85 minute duration, I spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion... Lets just say the acting is of a low standard & leave it at that.<br /><br />The Invisible Maniac is crap, plain & simple. I found no redeeming features in it at all, there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish. Definitely one to avoid.
1891 1 This story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine. The immortal <PERSON>Charles Dicken</PERSON>'s story has been recreated in every possible way imagine. I admit I have not seen the classic <PERSON>Alistair Sim</PERSON> version and I'm sure someday I will but I would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version. I believe that if <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> himself had created his story for film this would be it.<br /><br />The story is well known, I won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another. A rich, stingy, mean, old man is visited by the Ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways. In order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits, each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with, past, present and future. Finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done.<br /><br /><PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is absolutely, undeniably perfect for this role. He takes hold of the <LOCATION>Ebeneezer Scrooge</LOCATION> role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character. He is not just a mean old man, but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world. There is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge.<br /><br />Not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place. This is a grand epic of Victorian <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dickens England</LOCATION> is recreated before our very eyes, the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market. Director <PERSON>Clive Donner</PERSON> brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination. I could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery. It's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real. The film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between.<br /><br />The rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life. <PERSON>Bob Cratchitt</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> and his entire family including and especially the young <PERSON>Tiny Tim</PERSON> played by <PERSON>Anthony Walters</PERSON> were wonderful. The Ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story. A Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> is not a light story. <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> wrote this story for a dark period in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s life and it's one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark, almost scary, and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around. The dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures Christmas miracles. The score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the Christmas music, everything fits together. Apparently Christmas movies are my favorite because I insist everyone see this Christmas Carol above all others. 10/10
1892 0 Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /><br />Because it's so popular, I've tried more than once to watch it and I can't make it through an entire episode.<br /><br />For one thing, the acting is horrible. Everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch. They talk in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language. I've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.<br /><br />For another thing, it's NOT FUNNY. The plots are dull. They're not creative, intelligent, or FUNNY. Shouldn't a sitcom be funny?? Why am I not laughing?<br /><br />Lastly, what is seventies about this? It's about as authentic to the seventies as "Happy Days" was to the fifties.<br /><br />OH and what is up with <PERSON>Ashton Kutcher</PERSON>? Who cast this untalented dweeb? And now he's making movies?? Oh, save us all!<br /><br />If people think this is quality television, it worries me.
1893 1 As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years, whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other. That has somehow slipped past one <LOCATION>Ebenezer Scrooge</LOCATION>, merchant and money lender in 19th century <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.<br /><br />As his nephew points out to his uncle, he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug. The humanity in <LOCATION>Scrooge</LOCATION> was driven out long ago, he's a hard case, a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart, Mr. <PERSON>Potter</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bedford Falls</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.<br /><br />But as <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON> told this tale, redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> and show him how.<br /><br />A Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Oliver Twist</PERSON> was. The characters in this film are middle and lower class. The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in <LOCATION>Oliver Twist</LOCATION>, but they are having to struggle to stay up there. Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON> works for. <br /><br />Like <PERSON>George Bailey</PERSON> who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much, <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON> needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world.<br /><br /><PERSON>Patrick Stewart</PERSON> in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge. But <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> captures the old miser pretty well in this film. The meanness of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> joins a fine tradition of people like <PERSON>Reginald Owen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alastair Sim</PERSON> who've both done great interpretations of Scrooge.<br /><br />Among the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed <PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> as <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON> as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present. <br /><br />According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> made that they have archived and it is one of the best.
1894 0 As someone who lived through,and still remembers that decade vividly,if the actual '70s had been half this funny and (semi)normal,they would have been so much more enjoyable.Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids did.The country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it spawned,especially in the behavior department;the petulance,the smugness,the self-righteousness,the childishness,the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that.<br /><br />Someone compared to "Happy Days",and I can see why:They were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast,and they both offer only surface ,cliched depictions of the actual eras,not even close to the full scope of it,just showing the obvious things - the fashions,toys,music,contraptions,etc,and that's it.For those too young to remember,or weren't born then,trust me,the '70s weren't like that,any more than "Happy Days" were like the actual '50s,as "M*A*S*H*" didn't accurately portray life at a <ORGANIZATION>US Army</ORGANIZATION> medical base during the Korean War,etc.
1895 1 and possibly closest to the <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> story line. Although I find the young <PERSON>Ebenezer</PERSON> hard to watch (who's idea was that period hair, surely they could have done better than that!), <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> does an incredible job as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON>. His delivery of some of the lines from <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> finally brought it to life for me. <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON> is everything we expect and more of the Ghost of Christmas present. I find <PERSON>G.C. Scott</PERSON>'s Scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by <PERSON>Patrick Stewart</PERSON>. The scene Christmas Morning when <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> realizes he hasn't 'missed it', is enough to convince one that <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> knows how to act versus overact. He's phenomenal here. Nearly the entire cast is incredible. The Tiny <PERSON>Tim</PERSON> in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little tough to look at, almost too sweet. Still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday. Enjoy!
1896 0 I've tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s Show," I don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s -- the decade in which I grew up. Of the episodes I have seen, most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period. Take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '70s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny.<br /><br />If you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the '70s, in my humble opinion you can do no better than "The Wonder Years."
1897 1 This is simply one of the finest renditions of <PERSON>Dicken</PERSON>'s classic tale. The script very accurately follows the story originally penned by <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>, and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere. Viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice.<br /><br /><PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts. I found that he was able to win me over to the point where I sympathized with the old miser, something rarely done in other versions. The superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas Carol versions I have seen.
1898 0 I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (<PERSON>Debra Jo Rupp</PERSON> being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichÃ©d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show
1899 1 "Telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule, which is why this film always tends to buck the trend.<br /><br /><PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies, and still makes him a simpathetic character. The production value for this film was exceptional, never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups, yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops. A movie that certainly stands alone.
1900 0 I caught this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese "Green Card". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of <PERSON>John Woo</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> films. I an not adverse to a light hearted films, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director <PERSON>Steven Okazaki</PERSON> must have spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the ONLY person who sounded genuine was <PERSON>Brenda Aoki</PERSON>.. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE surprising is that <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> morning news called this "a refreshing breath of comedy". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. I actually think that "Spike of <LOCATION>Bensonhurst</LOCATION>" is a better acted film than this...and I walked out half way through that film!
1901 1 The setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' classic tale. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is very believable as is the rest of the cast. His Scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie. Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant. The 19th Century English town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> and adds to the plausibility of this film. It is a movie I watch every Christmas along with the real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.
1902 0 *** May contain spoilers. *** <br /><br />If LIVING ON <LOCATION>TOKYO</LOCATION> TIME were some bold experiment where real-life wanna-be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety, anti-depression, and anti-psychotic medications (this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies) all during filming, then this movie would hold far more interest. Or, if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming, then <LOCATION>TOKYO</LOCATION> TIME could be more easily explained.<br /><br />As it is, this film is filled with lifeless, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister, it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as "near sleep."<br /><br />Fret not about the actors speaking over each other's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog. Everyone speaks with a depressing, monotone voice. No laughing. No yelling. No vigor. No one has energy enough to crack a smile. The result: complete and total boredom.<br /><br />And it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish.<br /><br />Avoid this lifeless film at all costs. Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese romance story, check out THE LONG VACATION which has an ample amount of everything LIVING ON <LOCATION>TOKYO</LOCATION> TIME does not.
1903 1 I know many people have a special fondness for the <PERSON>Alistair Sim</PERSON> version of <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghost story.<br /><br /><PERSON>Scott</PERSON>--typecast as Scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving. I think it's up there with his performance in <LOCATION>Patton</LOCATION>. The spirits are all effective, each one creepier than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come sends shivers down my spine every year. And what a supporting cast! <PERSON>David Warner</PERSON>, in particular, is in top form as <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>, as is <PERSON>Susannah York</PERSON> as his wife. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrific Christmas classic.
1904 0 Happy Go Lovely is a waste of everybody's time and talent including the audience. The lightness of the old-hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable. Very few people watched these movies for their plots. But, they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs. Not Happy Go Lovely. And <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION> as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie, and couldn't do it. The Scottish locale was wasted. Usually automatically ubiquitous droll Scottish whimsy is absent. The photography was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. <PERSON>Cesar Romero</PERSON> gives his usual professional performance, chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part, in the type of producer role essayed frequently by <PERSON>Walter Abel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Adolph Menjou</PERSON>. <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> is just fine, and no one could do <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> like <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>. At the end of the day, if you adore <PERSON>Niven</PERSON> as I do, it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
1905 1 So this made for TV film scores only a 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Without question this 1984 version of <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>' classic tale is the best ever made. And yes, the Hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version, although the acting was wonderful.<br /><br /><PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> is simply incredible as <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON>. We all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later on that evening. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> is properly gruff as Scrooge. Too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new-found glee that he awakens to on Christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>. He's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner.<br /><br />The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, as are the costumes, music, and scenery. 19th Century <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> comes to life in <PERSON>Clive Donner</PERSON>'s visionary style. The film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits. The important tale of morality shines through in every frame, though.<br /><br />You won't often find this version aired on television anymore, and that is a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday. When the decorations come out of the basement, this film should find its way into the DVD player at least once during the season.<br /><br />10 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.
1906 0 "Happy Go Lovely" has only two things going for it. And those two things are <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION>'s legs. This is a British (<ORGANIZATION>Excelsior Films</ORGANIZATION>) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second tier stars. I would imagine that <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION> took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. <PERSON>Ellen</PERSON>'s chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cesar Romero</PERSON> (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and <PERSON>Bobby Howes</PERSON> (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.<br /><br />The choreography is boring, but Ms. <PERSON>Ellen</PERSON> gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a "dancing stand in" in several of her pictures". But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.<br /><br />It's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.<br /><br />4 out of 10
1907 1 Far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's. <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be <PERSON>Patton</PERSON>. Mr. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> seemed to jump off the screen. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> as <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> brought an richer, more robust, yet a more deeply moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Mr. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> seemed to bring <PERSON>Scrooge</PERSON> to a more personal, understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper, almost as a soliloquy, as he would berate the Christmas holiday in one breath, yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line. He could portray the sour and crusty Scrooge, and a misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge all in the same scene.<br /><br />Truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation.
1908 0 The oddly-named <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION> was to movie dancing what <PERSON>Sonja Henie</PERSON> was to movie ice-skating: blonde, girlish, always delightful to watch, but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material. When I watch <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION>'s sexy apache dance with <PERSON>Gene Kelly</PERSON> in 'Words and Music', I can't help noticing that her blouse (yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes) seems to be made out of the <LOCATION>South Vietnam</LOCATION> flag. For some reason, the very American <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION> starred in *two* musicals (made several years apart) set in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, a city not noted for its tap-dancers: 'Let's Be Happy' and 'Happy Go Lovely'.<br /><br />In the latter, <PERSON>Cesar Romero</PERSON> plays an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>. There's a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival, which is nonsense: the Festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows. We also see a couple of stock shots of the Royal Mile: apart from a few Highland accents, there's absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie. The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning, when we learn that the title of <PERSON>Romero</PERSON>'s show is 'Frolics to You': this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and <ORGANIZATION>Yanks</ORGANIZATION> won't.<br /><br /><LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION> is, as usual, cute and appealing and an impressive dancer, but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad. The plot -- mistaken identity between magnate <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> and reporter <PERSON>Gordon Jackson</PERSON> -- is brainless, though no more so than the plots of several dozen <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> musicals. <PERSON>Romero</PERSON> is less annoying than usual here, probably because (for once) he isn't required to convince us that he's interested in bedding the heroine.<br /><br />The single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of <PERSON>Bobby Howes</PERSON>. The father of <PERSON>Sally Ann Howes</PERSON> was a major star of West End stage musicals; his wistful rendition of "She's My Lovely" was a big hit in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in 1937. Here, he shows up in several scenes as <PERSON>Romero</PERSON>'s dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number, nor even any real comedy. It's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word 'Lovely', sure to evoke <PERSON>Howes</PERSON>'s greatest hit -- would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do!<br /><br />The delightful character actress <PERSON>Ambrosine Phillpotts</PERSON> (whom I worked with once) shines in one restaurant sequence, and there's a glimpse of the doomed beauty <PERSON>Kay Kendall</PERSON>. As <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION>'s confidante, somebody named <PERSON>Diane Hart</PERSON> speaks in one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard: it sounds like an attempt to imitate <PERSON>Joan Greenwood</PERSON> and <PERSON>Glynis Johns</PERSON> both at the same go, but doesn't match either. <PERSON>Val Guest</PERSON> has a story credit, but this movie doesn't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies. The colour photography is wretched, though I realise that postwar <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> could not afford <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>'s process work. 'Happy Go Lovely' is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster, with 'waster' being the operative word. I'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10.
1909 1 This 1984 version of the Dickens' classic `A Christmas Carol,' directed by <PERSON>Clive Donner</PERSON>, stars <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ebenezer Scrooge</PERSON>. By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film <PERSON>Donner</PERSON> not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it. He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>. One could argue that the definitive portrayal of Scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction, ever-- was created by <PERSON>Alastair Sim</PERSON> in the 1951 film; but I think with his performance here, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> has now achieved that distinction. There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge. And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous. It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true. It's a study in perfection.<br /><br />The other members of the cast are splendid as well, but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s performance; and they do. <PERSON>Frank Finlay</PERSON> is the Ghost of <PERSON>Jacob Marley</PERSON>; a notable turn, though not as memorable, perhaps, as the one by <PERSON>Alec Guinness</PERSON> (as <PERSON>Marley</PERSON>) in the film, `Scrooge.' <PERSON>Angela Pleasence</PERSON> is a welcome visage as the Spirit of Christmas Past; <PERSON>Edward Woodward</PERSON>, grand and boisterous, and altogether convincing as the Spirit of Christmas Present; and <PERSON>Michael Carter</PERSON>, grim and menacing as the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come.<br /><br /><PERSON>David Warner</PERSON> hits just the right mark with his <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>, bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s Scrooge, and <PERSON>Susannah York</PERSON> fares just as well as Mrs. <PERSON>Cratchit</PERSON>. The real gem to be found here, though, is the performance of young <PERSON>Anthony Walters</PERSON> as <PERSON>Tiny Tim</PERSON>; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin, and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film.<br /><br />The excellent supporting cast includes <PERSON>Roger Rees</PERSON> (<PERSON>Fred Holywell</PERSON>, and also the narrator of the film), <PERSON>Caroline Langrishe</PERSON> (<PERSON>Janet Holywell</PERSON>), <PERSON>Lucy Gutteridge</PERSON> (Belle), <PERSON>Michael Gough</PERSON> (Mr. <PERSON>Poole</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Joanne Whalley</PERSON> (Fan). A flawless presentation, this version of `A Christmas Carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever. And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of <PERSON>George C. Scott</PERSON>. A thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience, this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home. I rate this one 10/10.
1910 0 I don't think any player in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> history lasted as long as <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm. He could act, got an Oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper.<br /><br />Happy Go Lovely is a case in point. It's a musical and for the most part you'll remember <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION>'s dancing. You'll remember that they are in <PERSON>Scot</PERSON>'s costume as the film is set in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> during their festival. But if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory.<br /><br />The plot is light. <LOCATION>Vera-Ellen</LOCATION> is the American lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>. She starts in the chorus and runs late one day. She gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king. Everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire. Doors open up as they've never opened before.<br /><br />The millionaire is <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake. <PERSON>Cesar Romero</PERSON> has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical.<br /><br />In the end though Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless fluff which <PERSON>David Niven</PERSON> did so much of and got so tired of.
1911 1 This movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit. She brings her way of dealing with the law, which means more than simple convictions. The strong performance of the main character, supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable.
1912 0 It's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. It is by far the number 1 worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Not only have I ever been this bored before (luckily not for more then 1,5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. After the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. You hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and <PERSON>Trent Harris</PERSON> never lays his hands on a camera again...
1913 1 The simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film, and also relates to the dogma films.<br /><br />Did you ever get bored of those hollywood-style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of? Fed up with the married-living-single cop, the divorced-but-family-man, the personified doughnut and the tough hunter? Ever wondered how the real police work is like?<br /><br />Well, for germany, this film shows you. Set in the north between <LOCATION>west germany and east germany</LOCATION>, former DDR, an laid off post office clerk starts her job, fresh from policeschool. She quickly finds her way around the usual customers, and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman... but this is not much fun.<br /><br />Other german crime films like <PERSON>Derrick</PERSON>, Der Alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects. These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. Good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view, even more if you know that part of germany a bit.
1914 0 So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for <PERSON>Trent Harris</PERSON>, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...<br /><br />The documentary section at the beginning dragged on. Yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Seeing <PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON> dressed as a ONJ is the only highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.<br /><br />When <PERSON>Crispin Glover</PERSON> takes on <PERSON>Larry</PERSON>, the story-telling was better, but I just couldn't take anymore...
1915 1 i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really strong. might make you feel different.
1916 0 How did this become a blockbuster? Dear God I don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much. The movie was predictable & there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters. The movie was too bright, they should have done something with the lighting, eg. making the environment more darker. The make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick. This is 2006! People don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up. Most of the horror scenes we're taken from other <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> or Asian horror movies. Total rip off! This is why I don't watch tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of conformity. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, its now coming from the window next door? No matter how you put it, ITS STILL A RIP OFF. If you want a good horror movie, go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website.
1917 1 Wow! I have seen so many bad low budget films lately, but this one is great. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clichÃ© about the police. This film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. A perfect tradeoff!
1918 0 i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. <PERSON>Claudine Barretto</PERSON>'s performance. and i will take this time to overlook that <PERSON>Kris Aquino</PERSON>'s here. and... end.<br /><br />i really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away.. SAYANG.
1919 1 There are many police dramas doing the rounds. I am not sure why. It's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.<br /><br />This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION> area. No attempt is made to glamorise the police. They are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations.<br /><br />This is not a pleasant film. Not one to relax you. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family break-ups, and more distressed children. Let's face it. This is the world we live in.<br /><br />As days go by <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character <PERSON>Benny</PERSON>, a 12 year old from a broken family. <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> has her own way of patching things up. She turns a blind eye to <PERSON>Benny</PERSON>'s shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce <PERSON>Benny</PERSON>'s father. It set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs. After all, the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children.<br /><br />Well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment,
1920 0 Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Ringu. Well, I guess the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. So, so sad. I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so I can't believe this had to happen. <PERSON>Claudine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kris</PERSON> are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. To any aspiring movie makers out there in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>: You do not have to stoop this low to make money. There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them!
1921 1 This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort, but that just got wasted on me.<br /><br />What I felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some kid becomes "The one" and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (<PERSON>Rihanna</PERSON> eat your heart out!) I couldn't really discern the plot.<br /><br />Bottom line: nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.
1922 0 Silly, simplistic, and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE) goes nowhere.<br /><br />This brief (just over sixty minutes) tale isn't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns as it is a rip-off of <PERSON>Sam Raimi</PERSON>'s THE QUICK & THE DEAD (his admitted homage to the spaghetti Westerns) brought into a contemporary setting. In QUICK & DEAD, <PERSON>Sharon Stone</PERSON>'s character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by <PERSON>Gene Hackman</PERSON>) who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father (a brief cameo by <PERSON>Gary Sinise</PERSON>) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, <PERSON>Saki</PERSON> (played by the nimble <PERSON>Ryoko Yonekura</PERSON>) seeks revenge against the dastardly Mr. <PERSON>Tojo</PERSON> (played with minimalist appeal by <PERSON>Shingo Tsurumi</PERSON>), who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that <PERSON>Tojo</PERSON> sadistically cripples <PERSON>Saki</PERSON> with Â… well, I won't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it.<br /><br />In short, <PERSON>Saki Â</PERSON>– a pale imitation of the <PERSON>Clint Eastwood</PERSON>'s 'Man With No Name' Â– rides into the town Â– basically, there's a auto shop and a tavern alongside an American military base, so I guess that suffices for a town Â– corrupted by <PERSON>Tojo</PERSON>, the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter, <PERSON>Saki</PERSON> takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of <PERSON>Johnny To</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Woo</PERSON>. Of course, by the end of the film <PERSON>Saki</PERSON> has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but she rises to the occasion Â– on her knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending Â– and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher.<br /><br />Don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh.<br /><br />The image quality is average for the DVD release. There is a grainy quality to several sequences, but, all in all, this isn't a bad transfer. The sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times, but, again, it isn't a bad transfer.<br /><br />Rather, it's a bad film.
1923 1 The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON>'s tormentors were not up to the job. I presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy, but they were not well coached, and their scenes were a minor annoyance. <br /><br />I say not to judge this by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that Japanese culture readily embraces, and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> kids' films are routinely subjected to. For example, there is a preciously funny moment when <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON>'s small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai, and Shojo--the avuncular Kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out Japanese adult would do. Hint: this would not happen in a Disney film. This picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie. <br /><br />Early on, there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. There was a TV commercial in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> a couple years before this movie came out. It was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room. His mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up. Then, someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune, but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead. I mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and I didn't hear any objections to it while I was there. There is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in "The Great Yokai War" than one would find in a <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> movie. As a parent, if this were a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> film, I would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. Since it's a Japanese movie, I accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> production. However, I'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff, or I'd wait till they're older to show it to them.
1924 0 Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically sick, the film is so annoying.....unless you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time. The "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. Puh-leeze.<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait." It's also been done a lot better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of <PERSON>Robert Downey Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cybill Shepherd</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ryan O'Neal</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Stuart Masterson</PERSON>.<br /><br />At least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. That's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.
1925 1 I just finished watching this movie and I must say that I was so impressed.Everything about it was superb. The acting the characters, the story. A believable child who grew into brave, always willing to help others. His mum must be proud. I could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something. It is the prefect fable/tale with morals, cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk. A child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero. Picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the <LOCATION>Goblin Mountain</LOCATION> where he discovers the Yokai, who are amazing creations that <PERSON>Brian Froud</PERSON> would be proud of. And the evil <PERSON>Kato</PERSON> and his off sider who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture the Yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects, like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill. <PERSON>Takashi</PERSON> a young boy is the one to become their saviour, alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a River Princess as well as a cute little creature that, if it had been <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores. The lines are good especially the Don't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. Suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy! Though I must admit that the end was a wee bit sad. And not necessarily so. Cheers Furdion
1926 0 'Chances Are' a big mistake to see. You could know director <PERSON>Emile Ardolino</PERSON> from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you. He made a really, really bad movie.<br /><br />According to the story <PERSON>Christopher McDonald</PERSON> dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up <PERSON>Robert Downey Jr</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jr</PERSON> returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, <PERSON>Mary Stuart Masterson</PERSON> (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other. Then appears <PERSON>Jr</PERSON> former wife, <PERSON>Cybill Shepherd</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jr</PERSON> falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves <PERSON>Ryan O'Neil</PERSON>.<br /><br />In one of his first roles <PERSON>Robert Downey Jr</PERSON>'s on his worst. He copies <PERSON>Michael J Fox</PERSON>.<br /><br />After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />Anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.
1927 1 <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about him doing a kids film, because I would hate to see him depart from his films I came to love: Visitor Q, <PERSON>Gozu</PERSON>, <PERSON>Izo</PERSON>, Ichi the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he's succeeding. Still this was the first of his films I'd seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. Of coarse I bought it without seeing it and was glad I did.<br /><br />Great Yokai War is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too. The whole film reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either. The dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be. I personally wasn't bothered by the CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice.<br /><br />If you are a die hard <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> fan, you may not like this one. But, I suggest giving it a shot. It proves that <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> is as diverse and talented as I suspected he is. He also continues to make his signature <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.<br /><br />To those people that are new to <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one, I suggest these other <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> films: 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of the Katakuris' '<PERSON>Sabu</PERSON>' and 'The Bird People in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.' <br /><br />Good job <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>! 8/10 stars.
1928 0 Predictable plot. Simple dialogue. Shockingly unemotional performances. But <PERSON>Robert Downey</PERSON>, Jr. is so cute, I gave this "poor man's afternoon special" a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved.
1929 1 "Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film by <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones. However, older children may well eat this up, that is, if you play it dubbed in English.<br /><br />The story is that of a young boy, who has moved with his mother to the country, to live with his grandfather, after a divorce. During a village festival the boy is chosen as a "<ORGANIZATION>Kirin</ORGANIZATION> rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure, of course.<br /><br />Meanwhile, evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt, go-go boots & a beehive hair-do, teams up with an evil Yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the City of Rage itself, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city...says one, "Oh, it's only Gamera". <br /><br />The young boy has befriended Yokai, which are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, that have isolated themselves away from humans, and all the Yokai in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> band together to fight the evil.<br /><br />In many ways <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> & crew have taken the late 60's/early 70's Yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for (older) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "Transformers". The look and feel of the film is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads, but still, older ones might enjoy it. As for adults, there's not much here not to like, if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this.<br /><br />Cool & fun stuff, kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>..and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
1930 0 First I liked that movie. It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. The costume designer <PERSON>Albert Wolsky</PERSON> did his best!!! The same as wonderful set decorator <PERSON>Robert R. Benton</PERSON> - this man really had a very good taste!!! But the script writers disappointed me extremely. The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Don't like the ending. The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright. It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, <PERSON>Robert Downey Jr.</PERSON> was very funny in the dancing scene : )))... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, <PERSON>Corinne Jeffries</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>Cybill Shepherd</PERSON> after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend <PERSON>Philip Train</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ryan O'Neal</PERSON>), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!! It would be a good movie, if not the ending and some missed human psychology.
1931 1 Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklore. It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade.<br /><br />The yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak, kappa water imp, a living 'brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist, & so on.<br /><br />These sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore, but from a type of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa Era, comparable to today's Halloween haunted houses, or the "freak shows" of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks. Ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create "chills" during the hot summers. The fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky, this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills.<br /><br />These rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> & disguised himself as a samurai lord. Despite that some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit goofy, & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak, it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming. It has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade. Viewed in the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, moving & touching.<br /><br /><PERSON>Yoshiyuki Kuroda</PERSON> also directed the famed <PERSON>Lone Wolf</PERSON> & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) &and was the special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of <LOCATION>Majin</LOCATION> at its best, but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun. The first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films, with the GOZU & IZOO consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers.
1932 0 Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning. While there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes. The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them. In short; they're rubbish. This isn't good considering that they're the leads, and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. It's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't (not completely). It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare. Oh dear.<br /><br />As you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie. However, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults. First and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. The central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas). Thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. This is to be expected as it stars kids, but <PERSON>Bernard Rose</PERSON> should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. The film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing. In fact, if I had to sum this travesty up in one word, I would choose 'painful'. Paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole. Save yourself the pain, see something else.
1933 1 2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It is official; "<PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>" is whacked.<br /><br />The annual midnight screening of the new "<PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>" film, "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "YÃ´kai daisensÃ´". Call it what you will this is a fanatical ride.<br /><br /><PERSON>Colin Geddes</PERSON>, the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. After the screening I can understand where they were going with that, but damn this is "<PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>" after all. He directed the '01 film "Ichi the Killer", when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening. And no, that wasn't just a marketing ploy.<br /><br />Plot Summary: A young boy with a troubled home life becomes "chosen," and he stumbles into the middle of a Great Spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey.<br /><br />This is not really for kids, well not 'too' young. Certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits (even the friendly ones) on display. This is unlike anything I've seen in the movie theater before. A fantasy naturally, some very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored can guarantee that. Will this ever hit <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>? Doubtful.<br /><br />My rating = B
1934 0 In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a "thinking man's horror film." Wow, you might say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2. <PERSON>G. Headley</PERSON> with a bad British (dubbed) accent, and a story with no chills, thrills or spills.<br /><br />It isn't even interesting psycho-babble. One will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of Leprechaun 5.<br /><br />The story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams. WHat you get isn't good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after the two hour point saying..where did my two hours go.<br /><br />The direction is uninspired and I wished it could even be pretentious...something interesting..it seems like the producers were on lithium.<br /><br />Even in the dream world things are boring.<br /><br />A short no on this one.
1935 1 What a strangely wonderful, if sometimes slight and bulky, big-budget fantasy this is. <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> had already proved, by the time he got to The Great Yokhai War, that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre (Visitor Q and <ORGANIZATION>Andromedia</ORGANIZATION> showed this, the former great the latter lesser). But here <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>, in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less, proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions, and with it boatload of CGI, creature-effects and make-up, and an epic battle that is more like a "festival" than something out of Lord of the Rings. The comparisons can be made far and wide, to be sure, and the most obvious to jump on would be <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON>, for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes, power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source, machinery as the greatest evil, and many bizarrely defined, flamboyantly designed creatures (or Yokai of the title). But there can also be comparisons made to Star Wars, especially to the Gungan battle in TPM, and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces. Or to anime like Samurai 7. Or, of course, to <PERSON>Henson</PERSON>'s films. And through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it's <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. <br /><br />Here, <PERSON>Ryunosuke Kamiki</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON>, the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world, but will become the hero in a world going into darkness. The darkness is from an evil sorcerer, who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world, and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures, the <PERSON>Yokhai</PERSON>, into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths. <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON> gets as pumped up to fight <PERSON>Sato</PERSON> the sorcerer as the Yokai once <PERSON>Sato</PERSON>'s main minion and cohort, <ORGANIZATION>Agi</ORGANIZATION> (Kill <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Chiaki Kuriyama</PERSON>, another great villainies) steals <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON>'s little furry companion, a Sunekosuri. Soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> and his crew. I would probably recommend The Great Yokai War for kids, but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in American circles. This has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by <PERSON>Sato</PERSON>. So the variety is on high on that end, and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the "festival" hits with the Yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope. But there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark, and <PERSON>Sunekosuri</PERSON> becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s disposal (and not just because it's cuteness squared); where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury, who ends up in a tragic battle with <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON> in robot form? <br /><br />Yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, Muppet and sci-fi counterparts. There's the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to <LOCATION>Akuzi</LOCATION> beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (I loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-Yokai). The biggest danger with <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end. He's got everything down, I'm sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON> and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> rubble in an overhead shot), but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat. I almost wondered if <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> might dip into (bad) Spy Kids territory, quite frankly.<br /><br />But this liability aside, The Great Yokai War provides more than a share of excitement, goofy thrills, and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies. It owes a lot to cinema, as well as traditional Japanese folklore, but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats. It's not the filmmaker at his very best, but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage. It's got a neat little message, and lots of cool adventure. 7.5/10
1936 0 An intriguing premise of hand-drawn fantasy come to life in a child's fever dreams. However, I imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than <PERSON>Bernard Rose</PERSON> is at riveting the viewer. The duel between <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>'s two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest, especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor I've ever seen.<br /><br />Use only for kindling.
1937 1 A lot people get hung up on this films tag as a "children's film", and that it certainly is, though it is one made for adults. <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War.<br /><br />The setup is simple a boy is selected to play the "hero" in this years annual festival, only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined. What follows is a hallucinatory, grotesque, whimsical, and often funny journey through the world of Japanese folklore, but wait there's also an evil Villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world. However, the villain here, is not a mere demon, it is the demon-spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans "use" and "discard". Usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment, the villain transforms the vibrant colorful Yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals(those whove played the video game, Sonic The Hedghog, might remember a certain Dr. <PERSON>Robotnik</PERSON> performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who Sonic had to then "liberate").<br /><br />The hero in this film is actually the least interesting character, essentially playing the straight man, in a world gone suddenly mad. Though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers, as do many of the Yokia themselves, who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots, some spirits being umbrellas with eyes, talking walls, or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans...of course in this magical world of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s Yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them.<br /><br />In several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy, as few, if any, of the characters are heroic, their victory being a combination of happenstance, almost arbitrary faith, and a desire to party. The Yokai spirits, only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout, after they mistake the end of the world invasion of Earth for a great Yokai festival, and even then only to dance and party. Also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending, but with a final scene, showing our hero years older, with an adult job, now unable to see the Yokai spirits of his youth, who then despondently turn to the villain, who being a spirit can never really die. This ending, with it's Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of Pokemon's Pikachu, warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves, but of the horrors of over-consumption. The villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them(in Japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit), and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence, they become soulless vengeful machines, not unlike those seen in modern video games, suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die, but can become deformed.<br /><br />This is one of the first scripts <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> has contributed to, and I believe it shows, as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness. Though I've focused mostly on the story (since lots of users here seem to write it off), I do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of CGI, stop animation, costume, and live puppetry, that works remarkably well. There's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film, and the <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> comparisons are warranted, as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons, though this film is sharper and more adult than either. The Yokai are beaten, brutalized, and turned into machines of living hate, who I believe even kill a few humans, a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening, while a sexual undercurrent, the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero, or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy, seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes, especially when considering this is a "children's film". However these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough, not to traumatize any children to bad. Grims fairy tales, before revisions, did much worse, far more often.<br /><br />All and all this is one of <LOCATION>Miikes</LOCATION> most accessible and engaging ventures yet, with enough visual drama and great performances(the Yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them, thats laugh out loud funny at times) to appeal to audiences of all ages, and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth. The latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them, but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood. Another beautiful, funny, and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex. Instant classic.
1938 0 I was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's TV series "Escape into Night" which, though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd, fascinating and disturbing. The acting in "Paperhouse" is wooden, unintentionally a joke. The overdubs didn't add tension they only reinforced that I was sat watching a botch. Casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth, chemistry or conviction. As in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted, consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible. Out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than I could have dreamt.<br /><br />"Escape into Night" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind.
1939 1 <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> makes a children's adventure film, not unlike The Neverending Story. It's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films. Even the worst <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> is better than a good many films, though, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that's worth recommending. It's at least as loud and obnoxious as most American kiddie flicks. I might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the DVD includes an English dub), but, like all of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s films, it can tend to move very slowly. That means you've got kind of a weird unevenness, where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse. The story itself isn't very good, either, and <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. This has to be <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and they come in all different, fantastical forms, and the costume designers, special effects crew, and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job. I've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects. I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), <ORGANIZATION>Agi</ORGANIZATION>, who sports dark eye shadow, a tight, white outfit, a white beehive hairdo and a whip. She's played, incidentally, by <PERSON>Chiaki Kuriyama</PERSON>, whom you might remember as <PERSON>Lucy Liu</PERSON>'s teenage henchgirl in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the film is played by <PERSON>Ryunosuke Kamiki</PERSON>, who provided voices for <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON>'s Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
1940 0 normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie got into my mind!!! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective, it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout. Another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat!!! i would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time!!!!!
1941 1 Now, I have seen a lot of movies in my day, but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me. And I'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all the acting is believable, the graphics are decent (for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie. Trust me, bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids.<br /><br />Here's basically what this movie made me to. It one, made me laugh...a lot, two, made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to, and three, it's a very uplifting story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil. It's a formula that is used a lot. But, in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago, the appearance of it is not to be judged. It's very touching, the ending is original, and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to. If you however try comparing this to other movies like "The Never-ending Story" or whatever it will diverse your opinion. Watch it as it is and you will enjoy it.<br /><br />It has been a good long while since I've been impressed like this. The only other movie where I have gotten this feeling is when I saw <ORGANIZATION>TMNT</ORGANIZATION> way back when it came out. There is something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. So don't over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
1942 0 After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first ever so bare with me.<br /><br />First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest (with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me.) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I wasn't particularly thrilled either! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing, after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality. As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in. Until she adds her constantly away father to the house, due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.<br /><br />Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach.<br /><br />In conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab!
1943 1 This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film, THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero. However, due to far superior modern technology, puppets and CGI are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd. However, give it a chance. Don't think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film.<br /><br />In many ways, this is exactly the sort of advice I'd give to adults who watch <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON>'s SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and features tons of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big differences between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child-friendly. While I do think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was intended mostly as a kids' movie, in the <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION>, most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent, scary and features some adult behaviors. So who is the audience in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>? Well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and composition. This is a rather narrow audience, indeed! <br /><br />While you are watching, look for all the strange little touches. In fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time. A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about <PERSON>Gamera</PERSON>, the scene that came with the comment "KIDS: Don't Try This At Home" as well as the use of <ORGANIZATION>Kirin</ORGANIZATION> beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)! <br /><br />By the way, director <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories I've seen have seemed "normal". Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films I've ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS). One thing for sure, it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other.
1944 0 This was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. For a horror or "thriller" film and hype, it's way too tame. There are only a few tense moments in here, not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre. Even those "tense" scenes weren't much. The music made them more dramatic that they actually were.<br /><br />There is a lot of symbolism in here, so the elitist critics label this "a thinking person's horror film." Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion I did - a waste of money at the video rental store.<br /><br />Summary: a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting. Vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised.
1945 1 Wow! So much fun! Probably a bit much for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very <PERSON>Terry Gilliam</PERSON> all the way through. While the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward, <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> still throws in A LOT of surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments. The whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero, with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein. And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant. As manic and imaginatively fun as other great <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> films, only instead of over the top torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via <LOCATION>CG</LOCATION> and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure. F'n rad, and one of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s best!
1946 0 This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ludicrous, the acting is over-the-top, and it looks cheesy. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by <PERSON>Mangeshkar</PERSON> and the curtain call of the legendary <PERSON>Meena Kumari</PERSON>. Watching the actress, who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. Her ex-husband, <PERSON>Amrohi</PERSON>, wrote and directed, but lacks the competency to execute either task well. Bollywood has produced far better films.

1948 0 This movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description. But to me it was a bit of a let down. Very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). Also, nothing of any consequence was being filmed. I have viewed quite a few different Korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part, which is different from the typical <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> film. But this one befuddled me to no end. I viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me. I still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life, I guess he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
1949 1 One of director <PERSON>Miike Takashi</PERSON>'s very best. It's so good it's difficult to put into words. At nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end.<br /><br />It recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) those films weren't afraid to scare - there's a lot of nasty detail here that I initially found jarring but soon realised it's nothing different to what I grew up on. The film is a compilation of '80s kid's films conventions. You name it, it's there: a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on; a sadistic henchwoman (Go-Go <PERSON>Yubari</PERSON> from Kill <PERSON>Bill Vol</PERSON>. 1); a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to. But all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth.<br /><br />One of the IMDb reviews begins "Where was this film when I was a kid?" and it's a sentiment I agree with wholeheartedly. Even while watching it I lamented the fact that I hadn't grown up on it; that it wasn't a part of my childhood like Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and, to a much lesser extent, The Neverending Story. Those films, and others like The Goonies are recalled but never copied - <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> relentlessly offering us a new take on things.<br /><br />Poor CGI is a staple of many of his films, sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice - a desire to present things in an outlandish way. Here the CGI is mostly average, solely due to budgetary limitations, but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle. The CG effects combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world filled with rich characters (and characterisation) that frequently borders on the visionary.<br /><br />This ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive kids though.<br /><br />Just jaw-droppingly wonderful. See it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle/appreciate it then show it to them. Let them grow up on The Great Yokai War as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't.
1950 0 I saw this director's "Woman On The Beach" and could not understand the good to great reviews. This film is much like that one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. Like his other films, you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog, wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten, pretty uninteresting characters. If you feel you can like this film, don't let my review stop you. I do like minimalism in films, but I feel <PERSON>Tsai Ming-Liang</PERSON>'s films are far superior. He has a fairly terrific actor in <PERSON>Lee Kang-Sheng</PERSON> in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but I don't. Oh, well.
1951 1 Also known as the Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War is <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well. The problem is that I can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie. The best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery, Neverending Story and Return to Oz spring to mind, but in the case of the Great Yokai War <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> probably takes things a little too far. In fact at the screening I was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable.<br /><br />The film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems. This brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre Quato homage).<br /><br />Following an incredible introduction for main baddie <PERSON>Kato</PERSON>, and his henchwoman Agi (a surprisingly attractive <PERSON>Chiaki Kuriyami</PERSON>), by way of an apocalyptic army raising. The story reverts to normal for a while, but it doesn't take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> rejects to take out the evil sorcerer.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times, the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichÃ©s, but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world. This really is a <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> movie made into a live action movie, albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> movie.<br /><br />The film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the Yokai is colourful, and largely practical, while the evil robotic monstrosities while not displaying the best CGI in the world have a practicality and menace to them which gives them far more of a palpable threat than you would imagine.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent, they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits. Even Agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from <LOCATION>Kuriyami</LOCATION>.<br /><br />While the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory; cute creatures, junior heroes, a thoroughly evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a telling lack of violence. There are elements which make you question whether <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> should have directed such a movie.<br /><br />The robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like T-101 sans skin and with added chainsaws. These beasts rip characters to pieces; suck creatures into their blood stained mouths, and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parent's nose before indulging in a little patricide.<br /><br />The creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds. The Yokai, essentially the heroes, are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the Yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal. If kids thought smouldering <PERSON>Anakin</PERSON> was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle. There is also limb severing, in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (<PERSON>Agi</PERSON> wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with <PERSON>Kato</PERSON> as motivation, while the Princess of the <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON> wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes), and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for.<br /><br />Spoilers An Example of this being that the Yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party. The subsequent battle more of a festival than anything, complete with beer, crowd surfing and moshing. Also a scene where <PERSON>Agi</PERSON> beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkill.<br /><br />End Spoilers At the end of the day The Great Yokai War is easily on of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s stronger recent films. While it lacks some of the perverse charm of say Gozu or Ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity. In fact this is easily <PERSON>Miike</PERSON>'s most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of <PERSON>Gogo</PERSON> arse.
1952 0 I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen, and doubt I will. It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (<PERSON>Jimmy Fallon</PERSON>).<br /><br /><PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. He's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like <PERSON>John Cusack</PERSON> or <PERSON>Adam Sandler</PERSON> might have been able to give it a shot. <PERSON>Not Fallon</PERSON>, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where <PERSON>Barrymore</PERSON> (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.
1953 1 <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>'s incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.
1954 0 "Fever Pitch" isn't a bad film; it's a terrible film.<br /><br />Is it possible American movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> churns out that they'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs? That's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film) is getting good reviews.<br /><br />I sat through this film stunned that screenwriters <PERSON>Lowell Ganz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Babaloo Mandel</PERSON> would even for an instant think their script was funny.<br /><br />The brilliant <PERSON>Nick Hornby</PERSON> usually translates well to film. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British film starring <PERSON>Colin Firth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ruth Gemmell</PERSON> in 1997; <PERSON>Peter Hedges</PERSON> found <PERSON>Hornby</PERSON>'s voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for a movie in 2000, writers <PERSON>D.V. DeVincentis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Steve Pink</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Cusack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scott Rosenberg</PERSON> didn't go wrong because they kept the essence of <PERSON>Hornby</PERSON>'s wit and humor. They made one of the best films of that year.<br /><br />So why does the American version of "Fever Pitch" go so painfully awry? The British version wasn't a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters we could like, respect and understand.<br /><br />But <PERSON>Ganz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mandel</PERSON> have excised everything funny in <PERSON>Hornby</PERSON>'s work. In Americanizing the story, they've butchered it, removing all that was good and unique about <PERSON>Hornby</PERSON>'s work and replacing it with conventional drivel.<br /><br />They've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy, never once veering from the wretched formula. <PERSON>Lindsey</PERSON> (<PERSON>Drew Barrymore</PERSON>) has three girlfriends, each of whom has a distinct function. One's overweight, the second's cynical and ambitious, and the third's a romantic. Want to guess how many male friends <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jimmy Fallon</PERSON>) has?<br /><br />What made "High Fidelity" such fun was not only a good leading man and lady, but engaging supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch," the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny. They're so insignificant, they're not even decorative. The only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it. Poor <PERSON>Ione Skye</PERSON> winds up as one <PERSON>Lindsey</PERSON>'s pals in a thankless role. The lovely Skye must have been wishing <PERSON>Lloyd Dobler</PERSON> would swoop in and take her away. Come to think of it, <PERSON>Cusack</PERSON> would've made an excellent <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>. Of course, <PERSON>Cusack</PERSON> is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.<br /><br />There isn't a single, solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced. Every plot turn is predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. <PERSON>Ganz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mandel</PERSON> labor for laughs. The first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow, you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch. It's almost as if <PERSON>Ganz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mandel</PERSON> penned this with some screen writing guru's formula pasted on the wall. When they got to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says this has to happen now." And, presto!<br /><br />Directors <PERSON>Bobby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter Farrelly</PERSON> don't help the film any. They have no concept how to introduce their story and characters (they hand over the V.O. narration not to the protagonist, but to another guy who sits behind <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Fenway Park</LOCATION>). Thanks to some extremely clunky writing, we have to watch <PERSON>Barrymore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.<br /><br /><PERSON>Barrymore</PERSON> does cute and adorable better than most. She's as good at it as <PERSON>Goldie Hawn</PERSON> in her heyday. But even her cuteness can't save this extraordinarily awful film. She tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes into the film, <PERSON>Lindsey</PERSON> tells <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>, "You're funny." The only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script. For <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> never says anything even remotely funny. <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> is neither witty nor funny; when he does comedy, he overacts.<br /><br /><PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> was never any good on "Saturday Night Live." He was quite possibly the least funny person on that show. Remember that lame sketch about a radio DJ who did all the voices? The only reason "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was because <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>'s cohort, <PERSON>Tina Fey</PERSON>, knows a thing or two about comedy.<br /><br />Actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely, if ever, are actually funny. That's true of <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle. His stuttering, unsure-of-himself shtick didn't work on the small screen; it's lousier on the big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately for <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>, his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the second in front of <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>'s school - are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability, but <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions doesn't even run the gamut from A to <PERSON>B.<br /><br />Ben</PERSON> has no personality or depth. Often, he comes across as an oaf. And not a lovable one at that. It boggles the mind what <PERSON>Lindsey</PERSON> would find attractive about him. Compare <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>'s performance to <PERSON>Firth</PERSON>'s in the British version, and you'll understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forced <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> is and how wrong he is for this role. Watching <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> in "Fever Pitch" makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of <PERSON>Ashton Kutcher</PERSON>!<br /><br />Just as "High Fidelity" did, an Americanized "Fever Pitch" could've worked brilliantly. It just needed better writers, more competent directors and, most definitely, a stronger, funnier, smarter leading man. Do yourself a huge favor: Avoid this rotten film; rent the 1997 British version and read <PERSON>Hornby</PERSON>'s book, instead.
1955 1 Where was this film when I was a kid? After his parents split up <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON> moves with his mom to live his his grandfather. <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON>'s sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone. Grandfather is only "here" every third day. Moms never really home. The kids always are picking on the poor kid. During a village festival <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON> is chosen the "kirin rider" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice. Little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world.<br /><br />Okay that was the easy part. Now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film.<br /><br />This is a great kids film. No this is a great film,flawed, (very flawed?) but a great film none the less. It unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON> struggles to find the strength to become a hero. Watching it I felt I was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book. I loved that the film does not follow a normal path. Things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication, one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep. There are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it (which is typical Miike) Certainly its a <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON> film. That Japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching, scary and funny all at the same time. No one except <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next. I admire the fact that <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that doesn't shy away from being scary, I mean really scary, especially for kids. This is the same dark territory that should be in the <PERSON>Harry Potter</PERSON> movies but rarely is. This a dark Grimms tale with humor. My first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that I couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world, then I realized who was making the movie. Hats off to <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images.<br /><br />Its also operating on more than one level. The mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk. Its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters.One of the Yokai (spirits) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed. You also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do. Its a wild concept, but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level. (there are a good many riffs and references to other movies,TV shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them, though many parents will) And of course there are the monsters. They run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between. Frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen. Its way cool and it works. One of the main characters is a Yokai which I think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on <PERSON>Tadashi</PERSON>'s head. (Acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird Japanese monsters) I mentioned flaws, and there are a few. The effects are uneven, some of the sudden turns are a bit odd (even if understandable) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film.. None of them truly hurt the film over all, however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie.<br /><br />I really loved this movie. I'm pretty sure that if I saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time. (where's the English dub?).See this movie. Its a great trip. (Besides its a good introduction to the films of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> minus the blood and graphic sex)
1956 0 I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of <PERSON>Sophia Loren</PERSON>. I'm a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian. I hate art in any kind of shape or form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the kind. Let me give you a rÃ©sumÃ© in a few sentences. It starts out with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker. The housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti fascist is gay. Despite of this they make love with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. The end. You want an even shorter rÃ©sumÃ©? BORING... That short enough? The guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the audience from this atrocity. On a side note my sister loved this movie. Like I said, I'm a Cultural Barbarian...
1957 1 Billed as <PERSON>Takashi Miike</PERSON>'s "first family film" - by people who haven't seen <PERSON>Zebraman</PERSON>, presumably. YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale. A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware. The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> has done, with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the YOKAI). Perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors, but I think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different. He's really never been a one-trick pony, but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics. Regardless, it's a great project for <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> to channel his boundless imagination and invention into.<br /><br />There's a very cartoonish feel to the production, evoking thoughts of <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> in places. The Yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on Japanese folk tales, which certainly influenced <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> as well (particularly SPIRITED AWAY). It must remembered that <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> has nothing like the budget of a <PERSON>Harry Potter</PERSON> film to work with, so the special effects aren't going to be seamless Hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious. Some of the special effects are great though, with some very well animated creatures (a mix of CG, stop-motion and puppetry). I think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap, and is all the cuter for it :) The young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it's so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting, but 9 year old <PERSON>Ryunosuke Kamiki</PERSON> is a genuine talent (I see he did voices in the last 2 <PERSON>Miyazaki</PERSON> films!). <PERSON>Chiaki Kuriyama</PERSON> is delicious as the villainess of the piece, though <PERSON>Mai Takahashi</PERSON> made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared River Princess - yum yum! Those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in YOKAI, but if you're a fan of <PERSON>Miike</PERSON> because of his imagination and wit, there's plenty to satisfy here. And it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got :)
1958 0 Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. <PERSON>Charlton Heston</PERSON> overdramatizes his role, yet it works. <PERSON>Edward G. Robinson</PERSON>, in his final role, makes the most out of it in <LOCATION>SOYLENT GREEN</LOCATION> more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150). A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective <PERSON>Thorn</PERSON> is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay is a joke. It is just as cheap as the entire production. The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically cop <PERSON>Thorn</PERSON> who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. An enjoyable piece if you have the time, but do not expect anything more.
1959 1 Peaceful rancher <PERSON>Robert Sterling</PERSON> is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors, that is until notorious outlaw <PERSON>Robert Preston</PERSON> shows up out of the blue to level the playing field. Soon he begins to go too far, feeding a growing sense of unease in <LOCATION>Sterling</LOCATION>, especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal.<br /><br />The Sundowners is a tightly-paced, gritty, and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by <PERSON>Preston</PERSON>. Here, he comes across as an evil version of <PERSON>Shane</PERSON>, that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed. Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise!<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Chill Wills, <PERSON>Jack Elam</PERSON>, and the debut of <PERSON>John Drew Barrymore</PERSON>, who became more famous for his offspring than his acting.
1960 0 My first full <PERSON>Heston</PERSON> movie. The movie that everyone already knows the ending to. A "Sci Fi Thriller". The campy factor. Everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when I rented it, and on the morning that I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that I was in (Not wanting to move. Put in player, hide in blankets). And though I tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture, it just really didn't make it. Everything was all over the place, relationships had no backbone, the ending had no lead in. Everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to, because even though we all know that it's people, it's quick answers as to WHY it's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window.
1961 1 The summary line above, spoken by <PERSON>James Cloud</PERSON> (<PERSON>Robert Preston</PERSON>) to his brother <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> (<PERSON>Robert Sterling</PERSON>) just about says it all. <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>, <LOCATION>AKA Kid Wichita</LOCATION>, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been. Not the sort of mentoring <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> envisions for younger brother <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>, who likes what he sees in <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>, especially when defending their ranch against local <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> cattlemen.<br /><br />The opening credits state 'Introducing <PERSON>John Barrymore Jr.</PERSON> as the Younger Brother', in this his very first screen appearance. That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON> almost immediately into the story. Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to <PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON>. No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family, I was left wondering if his daughter <PERSON>Drew Barrymore</PERSON> might have ever seen this picture. I'm inclined to think not.<br /><br />On the subject of resemblances, I was also struck by the thought that the young <PERSON>Robert Sterling</PERSON> looked a bit like <PERSON>Roy Rogers</PERSON> early in his career. Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as <PERSON>George Kerby</PERSON> in the early 1950's TV series 'Topper', I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that might just be me. His character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble, and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story. Minor subplots abound, including the relationship rancher <PERSON>John Gall</PERSON> (<PERSON>John Litel</PERSON>) has with his son the Sheriff (who Kid <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION> kills), and the troubled marriage between <PERSON>Kathleen Boyce</PERSON> (<PERSON>Cathy Downs</PERSON>) and her husband <PERSON>Earl</PERSON> (who Kid <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION> kills). Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of <PERSON>Tom Cloud</PERSON>'s hired hands, and figures in the somewhat predictable finale.<br /><br />What's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there, and for that reason, this Western earns points for following a less traveled, hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother/bad brother Westerns do. Combined with the eclectic casting of the principals, it's one I'd recommend, even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that I experienced with my copy.
1962 0 As a great admirer of <PERSON>Marlene Dietrich</PERSON>, I had to (finally) watch this very, very dull picture. It is Miss <PERSON>Dietrich</PERSON>'s first color film, and the world's most beautiful blond is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous bore, involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff: religious guilt. (Who needs it???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all <PERSON>Dietrich</PERSON>'s films (and I have seen most, including "<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>") this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching. The color photography is OK (this is a very early Technicolor release), but to no purpose. Ridiculous casting: <PERSON>C. Aubrey Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Basil Rathbone</PERSON> (enough said?). The only thing of any interest at all is <PERSON>John Carradine</PERSON>'s outlandish caricature of a performance as "The Sand Diviner," who foretells all that will happen. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Yet another example of <PERSON>David O. Selznick</PERSON>'s highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film? -- other than That One?) And, for one final annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with volume levels seemingly randomized. Highly unrecommended.
1963 1 Sterling and younger brother try to survive on land, being squeezed by big cattlemen. When 'rogue' brother <PERSON>Preston</PERSON> arrives, a moral dilemma ensues. John 'Drew' <PERSON>Barrymore</PERSON> steals the show as the younger, impressionable brother-Barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse. Moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax.
1964 0 The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual treat to the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, at first, by the idea of <PERSON>Dietrich</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> leaving religion in order to "find" their capacity for love. What follows is a huge disappointment. <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment. <PERSON>Dietrich</PERSON>'s amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask. As a monk, <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> held the formula for the monastery's liquer (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) -- when he leaves his "marriage to god" the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> was well rid of his past. However, the journey that follows is all too predictable.
1965 1 This is one of those westerns that, well, stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog. Very few can hold up to it over the long haul. That said, the rest is pretty bad. Nevertheless I am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of The Wild Bunch, <PERSON>Junior Bonner</PERSON>, and perhaps a few more. <br /><br />It is riddled with weaknesses, <PERSON>John Drew Barrimore</PERSON> the most glaring. However it does have one truly memorable scene. Nothing like it. Its right after Kid <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION> kills the sheriff, and goes to <PERSON>Jack Elams</PERSON> place trying to goad him into a fight. Wonderful stuff. Right up with the best in any western.
1966 0 When <PERSON>Marlene Dietrich</PERSON> was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like The Garden Of Allah. How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. Also how <PERSON>Marlene</PERSON> if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.<br /><br />The Garden Of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by <PERSON>Robert Hitchens</PERSON> who then collaborated on a play adaption with <PERSON>Mary Anderson</PERSON> that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. It then got two silent screen adaptions. The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French <LOCATION>Tunisia</LOCATION> to see some of what he's missed in the world. He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. She's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.<br /><br />The woman is of course <PERSON>Marlene</PERSON> and the runaway monk is <PERSON>Charles Boyer</PERSON>. I'm not sure what was in <PERSON>David O. Selznick</PERSON>'s mind in filming this story. Someone like <PERSON>Ingrid Bergman</PERSON> might have made it palatable for the audience. But you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see <PERSON>Marlene</PERSON> as a modern day Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered <PERSON>Rudolph Valentino</PERSON> and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.<br /><br />As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> happens to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink it's economics if <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON> leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man <PERSON>Charles Waldron</PERSON> on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.<br /><br />Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. Most especially <PERSON>Marlene Dietrich</PERSON>. I would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.
1967 1 I think this film has much to recommend it, particularly an especially sinister performance by <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching Mr. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>. Although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very hard to follow in some cases, all in all, it makes for a nice time in front of the tube.
1968 0 This picture seemed way to slanted, it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>. It paints a picture so unredeemable that I can't help but wonder about it's legitimacy and bias. Also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for PTSD. To me the subject matter seemed confused, it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light, as A) an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and B) an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the V.A. This is a legitimate argument, but felt off topic for me, almost like a movie in and of itself. I felt that "The War Tapes" and "Blood of my Brother" were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint. F-
1969 1 I happened across "Bait" on cable one night just as it started and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a chance. <br /><br />"Bait" ain't perfect. It suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness. But overall, this movie worked. All the elements aligned just right, and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film. <br /><br />Most of that, I think, is due to <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>. I don't know who tagged <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor. Believable and amazingly likeable, <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. You can tell he's working on instinct, and instinct doesn't fail him.<br /><br />The plot, while unimportant, actually ties together pretty well, and there's even a character arc through which <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>'s character grows as a person. Again, they could've slipped by without any of this, but it just makes things that much better.<br /><br />I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7/10. Bravo, <LOCATION>Mssr</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>.
1970 0 <ORGANIZATION>'Dead Letter Office</ORGANIZATION>' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.
1971 1 This film resembles in many ways `Enemy of the State' with <PERSON>Will Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gene Hackman</PERSON>, as we have an innocent (black) man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man. Usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster. That does not apply here. Of course I love everything <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this film then that. The main baddy, played by <PERSON>Doug Hutchison</PERSON>, was brilliant, and the story flowed with excellent extras such as <PERSON>David Paymer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Pastorelli</PERSON>. Our hero, <PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON> (played by <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>), was however irritating most of the part. He is so out of place, cracking bad jokes, evoking no sympathy from the audience. Or not to begin with, the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you (and on his followers as well!). I didn't expect much when I rented it, but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits. 7/10
1972 0 This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!<br /><br />The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with <ORGANIZATION>Dead Letter Office</ORGANIZATION>. Hopefully this movie will end up in the <ORGANIZATION>Dead Movie Office</ORGANIZATION> soon.
1973 1 If you like <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>,(<PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON>),"Date From Hell",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. <PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON> has plenty of <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON>,(<PERSON>Edgar Clenteen</PERSON>), "Hack" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor <PERSON>Alvin</PERSON> and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture.
1974 0 You know all those letters to "Father Christmas" and "<PERSON>Jesus</PERSON>" that are sent every year? Well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go, it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is "Dead Letter Office". Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was <ORGANIZATION>Royal Mail</ORGANIZATION>, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a Mr <PERSON>Wang</PERSON>, some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I've-Never-Heard-Of-You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.<br /><br />"Dead Letter Office" (the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up) follows the story of <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> (<PERSON>Miranda Otto</PERSON>) who grows up in a seriously divided home. Writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another. So, logically, she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant <PERSON>Frank Lopez</PERSON> (<PERSON>George Del Hoyo</PERSON>). Slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?<br /><br />Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god-awful <PERSON>Heather Graham</PERSON> film "Committed" while watching this. However, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that ain't difficult. For a start, this film is much more logical. True, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. It is also well acted. Both <PERSON>Otto</PERSON> and <PERSON>Del Hoyo</PERSON> are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best. Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. The other part is that when you consider <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s draconian immigration policy (i.e. if you don't speak English, rack off!), such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. The other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.<br /><br />Despite that, "Dead Letter Office" is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyone's taste but I liked it. Yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an Australian film). There ain't any major laughs, there's no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. But it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth-shattering in its magnificence, it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time. It's the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there.
1975 1 The movie is great and I like the story. I prefer this movie than other movie such The cell ( sick movie ) and Highlander ( silly movie ). I just tell the truth, I like a reality hehe and also a true story :)<br /><br />
1976 0 This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesn't succeed on ANY level. The acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete garbage, I can't believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />And I'm very sure <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic.
1977 1 I liked this movie. When the guy who was in on a bank heist of $40 million in gold dies, his cell mate is used as "Bait" to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner (by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge). It's an action, spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of Enemy Of The State. Well acted and good enough plot.
1978 0 Okay so i found out about this movie and I watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether I should watch it or not. Before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it. i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time. So i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought: The beginning started off fine for me. It seemed to be heading in a decent direction. Got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point. Then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on. There was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that. It had about 3 of these pointless scenes, where you see the main character <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward. Then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull. Oh and as a note <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> still did a great job. Okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to <PERSON>Maya</PERSON>'s attention. Thats where it got disturbing. I didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it. I cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so...i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up. But if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised.
1979 1 Both my friend and I thought this movie was well done. We expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts. We both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy. I was impressed with the supporting actors and of course <PERSON>Dave Morse</PERSON> always puts in a terrific acting job. Most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid. We both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie. If you don't buy rent it for a good time.
1980 0 Do not waste your time or your money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. It was. I can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public. It was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. It went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick. And really not a good one. I went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him. Almost. All in all, an awful movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Don't waste your money. And don't let your kids watch it.
1981 1 I really liked this movie. Of course the idea is pretty much out there...the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding. But <PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON>, the man who the feds have "volunteered" to be implanted with the device, is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while. <PERSON>Alvin</PERSON> even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem. Definetly worth a watch.
1982 0 If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. Spoiler: <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> turns the tables on her assailant. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. She in essence nullifies the judicial system. The film "The Accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What the "Descent" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? Is victim any better that the accuser? No!!!
1983 1 I really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. This movie was not intended to be a "deep thought" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be. In fact, it would appear that if ANY movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.<br /><br />This movie was an Action/Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. And for an Action/Comedy, it was very well done. I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.<br /><br />The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, <PERSON>Hudson Hawk</PERSON>, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist. Now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the REAL "bad guy" is an uber-geek.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in "The Matrix" or a drama such as "Of Mice and Men" then this movie isn't for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you. I would normally have rated it about an 8 (on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it SHOULD be.<br /><br />
1984 0 This movie was disgusting. Their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage. What is garbage? The misuse of peoples time, the misuse of energy, and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write. <PERSON>Talia</PERSON> you are a sick demented loser. Your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem. <br /><br />The acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage. I ended up at a scene that was uncalled for. If you want to learn how to shock people watch a <PERSON>Larry Clark</PERSON> movie. I lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "no more support from me." How could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho? I feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is; congratulations you won his attention.
1985 1 I had no expectations; I'd never heard of <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>; all I knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it. I thought it was highly entertaining; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest. To me, <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> is an original. <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> is terrific (true, this is not his finest role). I thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done. I didn't expect a lot and I was happily surprised.
1986 0 I'm going to write about this movie and about "Irreversible" (the (in)famous scene in it). So you are warned, if you haven't seen the movie yet. This are just my thoughts, why I think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended).<br /><br />Acting wise, <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words). The villain guy is good, but loses his "evil" touch right before the end. If he really never changes, then why would he let a woman tie him up? He wouldn't, period. Then we also have the bartender/2nd rape Dude. Actually I don't think you would need him. At least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.<br /><br />Let's reprise the story. Rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). This wasn't intentional, as <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON> states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON>'s character meets a guy, who is a sexual Predator, in all the bad senses. But he makes an impression on her.<br /><br /><PERSON>Rosario</PERSON> commented that her character had a boyfriend before. I beg to differ. Because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother, here's another problem. After the first rape takes place, Rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened. Seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. If <PERSON>Rosarios</PERSON> character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her female friend: We see her at the party, it's obvious there is something going on and "boom" she is gone.<br /><br />The first rape is almost unbearable to watch. But feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending (rape), which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer! After rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. Threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ...), but left in the open. No real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. It's apparent that he isn't a "nice" guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit. But when <PERSON>Rosarios</PERSON> character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. We get the point that Rosarios character isn't the same anymore, that she went "bad" and is able to hurt people. (Too) Many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. Back to Rapist #1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by <PERSON>Rosarios</PERSON> character and they decide to hang out together again (really?). As absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl (very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately) and his football career. Well career is a stretch and he is bullied. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too clichÃ© to stay with you. So Rapist #1 submits to Rosarios character ... why exactly? Because he promised her, it was her day? Again, really? A guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... I guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. Another possibility would have a drug in his drink.<br /><br />So rapist #1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's Rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, that's just crazy! But what comes next, is even crazier. First she talks to him, then she "shuts" him up and forces an object into him. This is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. This isn't about what this guy deserves or not, it's just intense. And of course that was what they were aiming for. Now after she is "done" the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist #1. If this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if <PERSON>Rosarios</PERSON> character herself would have been doing all the "revenge". Having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.<br /><br />This isn't supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable, it's a hard watch & it is Art-house. But the 10 minute (I didn't count ) rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. Rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />Irreversible comparison: "Irreversible" had the rape scene, but the movie went on (even if it was back into time). <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON> is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. First, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. And secondly and most importantly, this is where the Art-house movie should've come in. It is more interesting seeing were Rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. But then again, she didn't actually physically do that much (see above) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...<br /><br />Good intentions (<PERSON>Talia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON> had worked before), but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesn't work) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...
1987 1 Actually this movie was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for instance <PERSON>Doug Hutchison</PERSON> (<PERSON>Percy</PERSON> from "The Green Mile"), who plays <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>. Another well known actor is <PERSON>Jamie Kennedy</PERSON>, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> as <PERSON>Alvin</PERSON>, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me, was <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> as <PERSON>Edgar Clenteen</PERSON>. He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person, and in "Bait" the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the <ORGANIZATION>World Trade Center</ORGANIZATION>, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated. Overall I thought this was a pretty good little film!
1988 0 This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped, and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a douche, but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist getting raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.<br /><br />3.2/10
1989 1 I watched this movie once and might watch it again, but although <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> is good in the movie, I feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as <PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON>. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON>'s scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by <PERSON>Edgar Clenteen</PERSON> (<PERSON>David Morse</PERSON>) are too funny. <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop. His tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. Once again <PERSON>Morse</PERSON> meets <PERSON>Doug Hutchinson</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>) in the theater. <PERSON>Morse</PERSON> ends up coming down hard on <PERSON>Hutchinson</PERSON>. They are both perfect for this scenario in each film. I personally love that quality in a film, where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film, as these two did in The Green Mile. Overall it was a pretty good movie.
1990 0 <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. While its clear why <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-Hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> seems out of place in the role. Forgive me I simply couldn't find her. Thats not a mistake, thats how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes I know she's on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. I blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which I would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it), and the image of <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.What can I say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it's time I can't get back. For <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> fans only, though be warned there's several real reasons why this is NC17. (And <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON>- please, you're a better actress, pick better scripts)
1991 1 This movie surprised me. Some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring <PERSON>Will Smith</PERSON>. But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> and comedian <PERSON>Mike Epps</PERSON> and the 2 wannabe thugs <PERSON>Julio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramundo</PERSON> (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch over again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value.
1992 0 Revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. Moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film. Having seen <PERSON>Gaspar Noe</PERSON>'s Irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* The end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. However, the film doesn't even follow through with this. Instead, the drawn out scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s face in an expression of either regret or "This didn't fix anything" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background.<br /><br />My problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? Do we feel <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s moment of regretful clarity? Aside from this failing, the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance. Character's are thin, dialog is monotonous, etc.<br /><br />Normally I try to take films on their own terms but Descent didn't really seem to know what those were. Thumbs down.

1994 0 Having just recently re-viewed "Lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with "Descent" even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.<br /><br />It's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of "I Spit On Your Grave," to the tawdry sensationalism of "Lipstick," to the tasteful handling of the issue in "The Accused." But "Descent," though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. No, "Descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn't that groundbreaking.<br /><br />I pretty much knew the plot going in. What I wanted to see *was* the "descent" or degeneration of <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s character. Being a big fan of <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON>'s, I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know, the kind of portrayal <PERSON>DeNiro</PERSON> brings to "Taxi Driver." Unfortunately, the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition.<br /><br />The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a Q&A on the DVD, but this excursion into <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s character is never believably rendered. We don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time, what she's after, or why she's doing it. The poor quality of the audio/video again don't help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. By the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.<br /><br />One point of success that <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> does point out in the Q&A is that by the end "revenge" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. While that's certainly valid, it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing.<br /><br />If you have the DVD, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really DOES show <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON>'s slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor <PERSON>Francie Swift</PERSON>'s prissy, condescending dorm counselor. If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.<br /><br />As the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we've seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. So what?
1995 1 I have to agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side. I could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived. <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> keeps running into the <PERSON>Julio</PERSON> and whats his name. In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown Cleveland.And just how could <PERSON>Robert Pastorelli</PERSON> dig up <LOCATION>Yankee Stadium</LOCATION> to hide the gold. Again, a comedy or drama? But it was still entertaining especially for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed <PERSON>Kimberly Elise</PERSON>'s performance, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress that is going to be viable.
1996 0 It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. The paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. Alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. It's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. Newsflash to the the creators: I paid to watch you MAKE a movie. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON>? This is somebody I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, I hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. The <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. As for the <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> character, she didn't seem like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> that this movie was even made.
1997 1 This is a really interesting movie. It is an action movie with comedy mixed in. <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> teams up with comedian <PERSON>Epps</PERSON> in this movie to give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> next. It was a well shot movie, the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel. <PERSON>Kimberly Elise</PERSON> also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even <PERSON>Jamie Kennedy</PERSON> is in this movie. It's worth seeing it you haven't seen it. It's definitely worth having if you are a <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> fan. It deserves more credit than it is actually given.
1998 0 I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was one huge disappointment. Disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing <PERSON>Rosario Dawson</PERSON> in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (sounds pervy, I'm not!) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's, I was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat, the actors unconvincing. Even <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> is empty. Some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. Just like the scene where <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> gets raped: it seriously lacks intensity! I wasn't expecting anything 'Irreversible'-style but still, aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her? I didn't. Not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either. I must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe I missed out something here but at the end of the movie, I couldn't help thinking 'I feel like watching <PERSON>Argento</PERSON>'s 'Inferno' again. lol. More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but I had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the American-Canadian border in <ORGANIZATION>Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s 'Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me'... the crude red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere... No, I just couldn't get into this movie. Too bad.
1999 1 I am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director <PERSON>Antoine Fuqua</PERSON> as the black <PERSON>Michael Bay</PERSON>. I don't see how since most of <PERSON>Fuqua</PERSON>'s movies are smarter than anything <PERSON>Michael Bay</PERSON> has came up with. At any rate...<br /><br />Story: <PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON>(<PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON>Edgar</PERSON>(<PERSON>David Morse</PERSON>) as a pawn to catch a killer named <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>(<PERSON>Doug Hutchinson</PERSON>). <PERSON>Alvin</PERSON>'s every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION> is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.<br /><br /><PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON> is funny as well as great as <PERSON>Alvin Sanders</PERSON>. <PERSON>Alvin</PERSON> is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. <PERSON>Doug Hutchinson</PERSON> is okay as <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his <PERSON>John Malkovitchesque</PERSON> demeanor. He was better here than he was as <PERSON>Looney Bin Jim</PERSON> in Punisher: War Zone. <PERSON>David Morse</PERSON> is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even <PERSON>Mike Epps</PERSON> is funny as <PERSON>Alvin</PERSON>'s brother <PERSON>Stevie</PERSON>. Both him and <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> had some funny moments on screen.<br /><br />The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.<br /><br />All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.<br /><br />PS: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... How long have you been living under a rock? I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by <PERSON>Quentin Tarantino</PERSON>. But those movies aren't violent right? Weirdo.
